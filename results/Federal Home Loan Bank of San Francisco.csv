Change’s membership will become effective upon its acquisition of the required $7 million capital stock in the FHLB-SF. The transaction is expected to close in May. “We welcome a partnership with the FHLB-SF to enhance our strength and reach as America’s CDFI,” said Steven Sugarman, founder of the Change Company, the parent company of Change Lending. “We are excited to expand our impact and better serve our target market borrowers.” Change is a community development financial institution (CDFI) that is certified by the U.S. Treasury Department, given to specialized organizations that provide financial services to low-income communities and others who lack financing options. Change and the Treasury Department went through a short-lived legal dispute after the lender sued the CDFI Fund for its “flawed analysis and mathematical errors,” leading to a decertification of Change Lending. The Treasury Department renewed the certification in February following a settlement agreement in November 2023. Change Lending’s services include small-business loans and lines of credit, investor real estate loans, rehab loans and renovation loans, according to its website.

By expanding the kind of mortgage collateral eligible to be pledged by member financial institutions borrowing from FHLBank San Francisco, lenders will be able to increase the amount of creditworthy mortgage applicants and include many underserved borrowers left out by conventional models. VantageScore estimates that using the VantageScore 4.0 credit model will result in approximately 33 million more consumers nationwide having access to a credit score that may aid them in obtaining a mortgage; including an estimated 5.5 million consumers within the FHLBank’s regional footprint of Arizona, California, and Nevada. “We know there are millions of creditworthy borrowers aspiring to be homeowners who are falling through the cracks,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, President and CEO of the Bank of San Francisco. “Expanding the pool of creditworthy applicants through the use of more inclusive and innovative predictive models, such as VantageScore 4.0, effectively helps us deliver the American Dream of homeownership to more applicants and further narrow the racial wealth gap. Over the last few years, we have dedicated significant resources and commitment to investing in expanding Black homeownership and we are excited to be the first mover among our peers and bring the program to life.” In October 2022, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced its approval of VantageScore 4.0 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, enabling widespread industry adoption of the new credit scoring method and opening the door to millions more qualified applicants by incorporating rental payments and other data points into scoring algorithms not included in traditional scoring models, all without lowering credit risk standards. Notably, FHLBank San Francisco is the first in the Federal Home Loan Bank System to accept collateral that uses VantageScore’s predictive and inclusive credit scoring model. This decision is the latest step that FHLBank San Francisco has taken over the last four years to advance racial equity in homeownership and wealth building: In June 2020, FHLBank San Francisco announced it would redouble its commitment to making homeownership possible for more Black households.In October 2021, FHLBank San Francisco launched the Racial Equity Accelerator, a two-year research and product advancement initiative with the Urban Institute to identify ways to close the racial homeownership gap.As part of that initiative, in October 2022, the Urban Institute issued an analysis, “Reducing the Black-White Homeownership Gap through Underwriting Innovations,” that detailed ways to use alternative data to expand the pool of eligible homebuyers and recognized the impact of VantageScore 4.0.In October 2023, FHLBank San Francisco published “Closing The Racial Equity Gap: A Call To Action,” which includes a package of recommendations for updating the housing ecosystem to close the racial homeownership and wealth gaps. In that report, FHLBank San Francisco highlighted the VantageScore 4.0 model as being more inclusive and particularly effective in communities currently excluded from the mortgage marketplace.Following the report, FHLBank San Francisco began a validation process that was completed at the end of 2023, validating the VantageScore 4.0 model as acceptable for residential mortgage loans pledged to secure credit from FHLBank San Francisco. “The decision by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to accept mortgage collateral backed by VantageScore will have a significant impact on boosting homeownership rates among creditworthy but traditionally underserved communities, while increasing safety and soundness,” said Anthony Hutchinson, SVP of Government and Industry Relations, VantageScore. “Addressing the persistent disparities that exist in mortgage lending is an important precursor to reducing the homeownership gap in communities of color, which is a priority that both VantageScore and Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco share.” “We believe in driving financial inclusion and creating more equitable access to credit in the communities we serve,” said Richard Wada, Chief Lending Officer at Patelco Credit Union, headquartered in Dublin, California. “We've been using VantageScore 4.0 for our auto loans and credit cards and that's provided us with a new pathway to provide fair and accurate credit scores to a broader population, creating opportunities for us to lend credit safely and soundly to consumers historically left behind. We look forward to leveraging VantageScore 4.0 for mortgage lending in the future.” About the Federal Home Loan Bank of San FranciscoThe Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco is a member-driven cooperative helping local lenders in Arizona, California, and Nevada build strong communities, create opportunity, and change lives for the better.

The move announced Monday could help broaden the credit box and contribute to housing initatives for racial equity, according to Teresa Bryce Bazemore, who is currently president and CEO of the San Francisco Home Loan bank. Bazemore will be retiring later this year. ""This was significant in terms of trying to move forward on having more people have the ability to borrow,"" said Bazemore, who said it brings to fruition an effort that's been in the works since it became clear a couple of years ago that the score held the potential to expand home lending. Of a total 33 million people nationwide who can't establish a credit metric using traditional models, Bazemore estimates there are 5.5 million in the San Francisco district who'd be scoreable using the newer measure, which considers payments like rent and other data outside of typical debt histories. A smaller subset of those 33 million, equating to $1 trillion in originations, would have scores of 620 or higher and would be in the 25 to 65 age range that makes them likely candidates for mortgages, according to a Vantagescore study released last year. Vantagescore didn't immediately have a measure of how many mortgage-ready people in the San Francisco district that could equate to but Tony Hutchinson, senior vice president of industry and government relations, was optimistic the initiative could generally broaden lending. ""We think this is going to be the impetus for a lot of people that have been on the fence,"" Hutchinson said, referring to home lenders who may be considering adopting the score before major government-related mortgage investors fully implement it down the road. At least one member of the San Francisco Home Loan bank, Patelco Credit Union, has signaled that it has used the more modernized score for other types of consumer finance, where the credit metric has more of a foothold, and is planning to extend that use to home lending. ""We look forward to adding Vantagescore 4.0 for mortgages in the future,"" said Richard Wada, chief lending officer at Patelco, in a press release. Bazemore said the San Francisco Home Loan bank would consider using FICO's advanced model too. In adopting either of the two advanced scores, lenders face the high cost of additional models at a time when the existing one is said to be going through a price hike. They've also voiced concern about the metrics' lack of a mortgage track record. Unlike government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's initiative, the San Francisco Home Loan bank move is not legislatively mandated. It allows mortgages with only Vantagescore to be used for collateral, limiting the credit reporting cost, Bazemore said. District officials have studied the score carefully the last couple of years and run blind tests that the provider of the credit metric provided data for but did not see the results of, according to Hutchinson and Bazemore, with the latter noting that it has fared well in that analysis. Given the aforementioned mortgage lender concerns about using the advanced credit scores, one recommendation Hutchinson has is to use them in conjunction with Special Purpose Credit Programs, which typically are limited in their application to a targeted geographic area ""One of the things that we think many lenders or mortgage originators should do, especially if they don't want to put a whole lot of money into it up front, is to test this on a small portfolio so they can get some practical knowledge without having to really go full bore into it,"" he said.

FHLBank San Francisco Launches $1M Program to Boost Affordable Housing in Native American Communities - Hoodline,FHLBank San Francisco Launches $1M Program to Boost Affordable Housing in Native American Communities  Hoodline,"Wed, 24 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2hvb2RsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzAxL2ZobGJhbmstc2FuLWZyYW5jaXNjby1sYXVuY2hlcy0xbS1wcm9ncmFtLXRvLWJvb3N0LWFmZm9yZGFibGUtaG91c2luZy1pbi1uYXRpdmUtYW1lcmljYW4tY29tbXVuaXRpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Hoodline,"To combat the affordable housing crisis plaguing Native American communities, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco has unveiled a $1 million Tribal Nations Program to fund infrastructure grants to foster affordable housing development in these underserved areas. Under the leadership of President and CEO Teresa Bryce Bazemore, FHLBank San Francisco has taken this step recognizing the critical lack of resources that has hindered Native American communities from securing grants and funding necessary for housing, according to a statement obtained by their official newsroom, Bazemore asserts that ""Solving the affordable housing crisis in our country is core to our mission and central to everything we do as an organization,"" the organization is not just talking about change, they're banking on it with real dollars. The Tribal Nations Program draws on partnerships with multiple housing coalitions throughout Arizona, California, and Nevada, including the Northern Circle Indian Housing Authority and the Pala Housing Resource Center, which are instrumental in channeling these funds effectively to increase capacity building and offer relevant technical assistance. Dr. Robert Wiener of the California Coalition for Rural Housing underscored the historical challenges faced by Tribal Nations in his interview with the newsroom, stating, ""This grant will enable CCRH and our partners to build the capacity of Tribes to access and optimize state housing and community development resources."" Fund allocation from the Tribal Nations Program will be proportional to the Native American populations across the FHLBank's tri-state district. This will empower tribal organizations to compete more effectively for funding from sources such as the Affordable Housing Program and Low Income Housing Tax Credits, among others. Annalee Trujillo from Pala Housing Resource Center highlighted the historic exclusion of Native Americans from state-funded housing programs in a newsroom interview, emphasizing, ""The Tribal Nations Program will enable us to provide capacity building, identify new funding sources and other housing related services that will allow our communities to thrive."" Housing and Urban Development statistics reveal the stark disparities, with about 15% of Native populations grappling with overcrowding against a national average of 2%, which only underscores the urgency of such initiatives. FHLBank San Francisco's framework for action further cements the bank's commitment to enriching lives through robust community programs such as the Empowering Black Homeownership and Middle-Income Downpayment Assistance programs, endeavors that translate to meaningful change on the ground. With an established track record of over $20 million in grants for affordable housing in tribal communities and significant contributions to economic development projects, FHLBank San Francisco's latest initiative promises to be a substantive addition to their efforts.

Congressman Salud Carbajal Announces $550000 in Middle-Income Downpayment Assistance Grants for First Time ... - Salud Carbajal,Congressman Salud Carbajal Announces $550000 in Middle-Income Downpayment Assistance Grants for First Time ...  Salud Carbajal,"Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYmFqYWwuaG91c2UuZ292L25ld3MvZG9jdW1lbnRzaW5nbGUuYXNweD9Eb2N1bWVudElEPTE3MjnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Salud Carbajal,"Today, Congressman Salud Carbajal (CA-24) announced that $550,000 in downpayment assistance grants for middle-income home buyers are being awarded to first time homebuyers on California’s Central Coast through the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLBSF). The 11 awards for Central Coast home buyers come from a new pilot program provided through the federal-backed bank to support aspiring California homeowners that are increasingly being left behind in the face of rising home prices and now rising interest rates with the resources necessary to close on their mortgages. “Owning a home is a dream that is becoming less and less of a reality for Central Coast residents, and a primary obstacle is the down payment required by homes whose prices have been rising to even more unobtainable levels with rising interest rates,” said Rep. Carbajal. “I’m glad to see our federally-backed banks set up with the explicit purpose of supporting housing accessibility in our communities exploring more ways that they can provide the support needed to make a dent in California’s deepening housing crisis.” The FHLBSF’s Middle-Income Downpayment Assistance Program was launched in May to provide matching grants of up to $50,000 per household in California, with funds coming not from taxpayers but from private support through the bank’s partner institutions. “Fostering home ownership for all of the working class across our region is at the core of our mission, and we are committed to continuing to funnel critical funding into the heart of the communities we serve,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, CEO and president of FHLBank San Francisco. “This is the first year of our Middle-Income Downpayment Assistance Program, and its creation was an important step to voluntarily increase the Bank’s ongoing investment in homeownership and other programs that make a difference in underserved communities. We’re grateful for Representative Carbajal's support and engagement and for the enthusiastic participation of our member lenders in California that made our program's inaugural year such a success.” According to the California Association of Realtors, fewer than 15 percent of home buyers could afford to purchase a median-priced, existing single-family home in California from July to September 2023. That same report found San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties to be some of the least affordable counties in California, with each requiring at least a minimum income of $226,800 to purchase a median-priced home. Ventura County also scored below the statewide average, with only 13% of home buyers able to afford a home in the same period of 2023. Additional Background: Rep. Carbajal has made lowering housing costs for Central Coast residents and finding solutions to California’s housing crisis a key priority of his time in Congress. Earlier this year, he attended the groundbreaking of a new affordable housing community in Guadalupe that was made possible in part through funding he directly secured in the 2023 federal budget. Congressman Carbajal’s work in Congress has also delivered $4 million to support the operation of the Anderson Hotel in San Luis Obispo, which provides housing options to low income individuals in the region. Rep.

Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Announces Annual and Fourth Quarter 2023 Operating Results - Yahoo Finance,Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Announces Annual and Fourth Quarter 2023 Operating Results  Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 21 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWRlcmFsLWhvbWUtbG9hbi1iYW5rLXNhbi0yMjQwMDAxMzYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (Bank) today announced its unaudited annual and fourth quarter 2023 operating results. Net income for 2023 was $539 million, an increase of $216 million compared with net income of $323 million for 2022. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $120 million, an increase of $3 million compared with net income of $117 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. “In 2023, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco played a critical role in providing on-demand liquidity to our members, which provided stability during a period of extraordinary market turbulence and rapid interest rate hikes,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, president and chief executive officer. “We remain committed to our congressionally mandated mission to provide low-cost liquidity to our members and funding for affordable housing and economic development across our three-state region. As we look ahead in 2024, we remain focused on supporting the important role community lenders play in fostering the economic health of our local communities.” The $216 million increase in 2023 net income relative to 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income of $232 million and an improvement in other income/(loss) of $38 million, partially offset by an increase of $38 million in other expense. The $232 million increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to higher average balances and yields on interest-bearing assets compared to 2022, partially offset by higher average balances and costs of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in net interest income was also attributable to an increase of $115 million in income resulting from higher net advance prepayment fees, which were elevated in 2023, primarily as a result of heightened advance prepayment activity during the year, which are not expected to occur at similar levels in the future.The $38 million improvement in other income/(loss) was primarily driven by an increase in fair value on the Bank's fair value option instruments and economic derivatives. Included in other income/(loss) for 2023 was $33 million in net realized losses from economic derivatives hedging prepaid advances. Additionally, the Bank received $28 million in settlement proceeds in 2022 from the final resolution of litigation of one of the Bank's private-label mortgage-backed securities (PLRMBS); there was no similar activity in 2023. The $38 million increase in other expense was primarily driven by increases of $11 million in compensation and benefits and $12 million in charitable ""mission-oriented"" contributions primarily to fund downpayment assistance grants to middle-income homebuyers (delivered by participating member financial institutions). For the fourth quarter of 2023, net income was $120 million, an increase of $3 million compared to the same period during the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to a change in other income/(loss) of $22 million driven by an increase in fair value on the Bank's fair value option instruments and economic derivatives. Included in other income/(loss) for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $12 million in net realized gains from economic derivatives hedging prepaid advances. Additionally, the provision for/(reversal of) credit losses decreased by $9 million which was largely attributable to increases in the fair values and the present value of expected cash flows of certain PLRMBS. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19 million in net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by higher dividends paid on mandatorily redeemable capital stock classified as interest expense. At December 31, 2023, total assets were $92.8 billion, a decrease of $28.3 billion from $121.1 billion at December 31, 2022. Advances decreased by $28.1 billion to $61.3 billion at December 31, 2023, from $89.4 billion at December 31, 2022. Investments at December 31, 2023, remained unchanged at $30.3 billion compared to December 31, 2022, attributable to an increase of $4.5 billion in mortgage-backed securities that was largely offset by a decrease of $3.4 billion in securities purchased under agreements to resell and $0.9 billion in federal funds sold. The Affordable Housing Program (AHP) is an annual statutory grant program that supports the creation, preservation, or purchase of affordable housing and is funded with 10% of the Bank’s previous year’s net income. In 2023, the Bank awarded $32.9 million in competitive AHP grants to support 38 projects that will create more than 2,800 units of affordable housing throughout Arizona, California, and Nevada, and allocated $12.5 million in 2023 to its Workforce Initiative Subsidy for Homeownership program. The Bank has allocated $63.4 million from its 2023 earnings for its 2024 AHP, an increase of $27.4 million, or 76%, compared to $36.0 million allocated from its 2022 earnings for the 2023 AHP. Also in 2023, the Bank announced a series of measures designed to support its members and the communities they serve, including plans to voluntarily allocate up to an additional 5% of its annual net income to affordable housing and economic development programs, in addition to its annual AHP contribution. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The Bank exceeded its 4.0% regulatory requirement with a regulatory capital ratio of 8.0% at December 31, 2023. The increase in the regulatory capital ratio from 6.4% at December 31, 2022, mainly resulted from the decrease in total assets during 2023. The Bank also exceeded its risk-based capital requirement of $1.2 billion with $7.4 billion in permanent capital. Total retained earnings increased to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2023, from $4.0 billion at December 31, 2022. Today, the Bank’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the average capital stock outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2023 at an annualized rate of 8.75%, an increase from the 8.25% rate paid for the prior quarter. The quarterly dividend rate is consistent with the Bank's dividend philosophy of endeavoring to pay a quarterly dividend rate that is equal to or greater than the current market rate for a highly rated investment (e.g., SOFR) and that is sustainable under current and projected earnings while maintaining appropriate levels of capital. The quarterly dividend will total $69 million, and the Bank expects to pay the dividend on March 14, 2024. Financial Highlights(Unaudited)(Dollars in millions) Investments consist of Federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits, trading securities, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities, and securities purchased under agreements to resell.The regulatory capital ratio is calculated as regulatory capital divided by total assets. Regulatory capital includes retained earnings, Class B capital stock, and mandatorily redeemable capital stock (which is classified as a liability) but excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Total regulatory capital as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively.Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income (annualized) divided by average interest-earning assets.Cash dividends are declared, recorded, and paid during the period, on the average capital stock outstanding during the previous quarter.

The Home Loan Bank of San Francisco came under heightened scrutiny for issuing advances to Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank before they went defunct earlier this year. Alex Lowy Teresa Bryce Bazemore, who held a front-row seat during the bank liquidity crisis this year as president and CEO of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, plans to retire when her term expires in 2024, citing personal reasons. The San Francisco bank's board chose not to renew Bazemore's contract after she asked to retire in 2025, though her contract expires in 2024. The board instead initiated a search for a new CEO, said Simone Lagomarsino, the board's chairman, who also is president and CEO at Luther Burbank Savings. Bazemore ""indicated that, due to personal and other considerations, she would like to retire in March 2025,"" Lagomarsino said in a press release. ""As a result, and in consultation with Teresa, the board has decided to move forward with a search to identify a new CEO who will deliver long-term continuity and engaged leadership."" The decision followed ""extensive deliberation and discussion"" about the Home Loan bank's long-term goals, including ""the implementation and integration of strategic changes that may arise from the 'FHLBank System at 100' review currently being conducted by the Federal Housing Finance Agency,"" Lagomarsino said in the release. ""The board recognized the critical importance of a CEO who would be engaged for the next several years to lead the organization forward and implement a vision and strategy to align with the outcome of the FHFA's review."" The San Francisco Home Loan Bank played a central role in the bank liquidity crisis in March, when it served as lender of next-to-last-resort to Silicon Valley Bank, which was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and ultimately sold to First Citizens BancShares in Raleigh, N.C. Other major borrowers of the San Francisco Home Loan bank this year included San Francisco-based First Republic Bank, which was sold to JPMorgan Chase in May, and Silvergate Bank of La Jolla, Calif., which self-liquidated in March. Last year, Bazemore earned $2.4 million, which included a base salary of $910,000 and other incentive compensation. When she joined the San Francisco Home Loan bank in 2021, she received a $100,000 signing bonus. Her employment agreement provides for 12 months of severance pay, equal to her base salary, plus other awards, according to the Home Loan banks' combined financial report for 2022. Regulation and compliance Are Federal Home Loan Bank advances a sign of distress? April 17, 2023 9:00 PM Last year, the Federal Housing Finance Agency that oversees that Home Loan bank system, launched a holistic review of the government-sponsored enterprise, its first in 90 years. Critics have questioned the system's hybrid public-private business model and whether the banks are engaged in the primary mission of supporting housing. FHFA Director Sandra Thompson is set to issue a report with policy and congressional recommendations sometime later this year. Separately, Fitch Ratings on Thursday downgraded certain ratings of the Federal Home Loan banks of Atlanta and Des Moines citing the ""high and growing general government debt burden,"" of the U.S. government. The ratings actions followed the downgrade of the U.S. to 'AA+,' from 'AAA.' The Home Loan banks are bank cooperatives that provide low-cost funding to 6,500 members including banks, insurance companies and credit unions. Created in 1932 to bolster housing during the Depression, the system incentivizes banks to buy mortgage-backed securities and agency bonds that can be pledged as collateral in exchange for liquidity.

If it stands, Thursday's ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge David Cayer in Charlotte, North Carolina could mark a serious setback for the U.S. Department of Justice in its effort to fight fraud in the sale of mortgage securities. Cayer said the government fell short of demonstrating that any false statements the bank may have made were material, or that the governing law covered the securities sales. Less than two hours later, the Justice Department filed court papers saying it plans to object to Cayer's findings. The lawsuit, which sought civil penalties, was a product of President Obama's Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, which includes the Justice Department and other federal and state regulators. It is one of several in which the government has relied on a law adopted after the 1980s savings and loan scandals, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, to punish alleged misconduct causing the financial crisis. That law has a 10-year statute of limitations, double the usual length in securities fraud cases, which the government took advantage of when it sued Bank of America last August over alleged misconduct dating from early 2008. Bank of America was accused of misleading Wachovia Corp, now owned by Wells Fargo & Co, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco about risks in the $855 million offering, from which they bought about 98 percent of the securities. While the securities were backed by 1,191 seemingly safe ""jumbo"" adjustable-rate mortgages, the government said more than 40 percent of these home loans did not comply with Bank of America's underwriting standards. STRETCHING FIRREA The government claimed civil penalties under FIRREA based on the bank's alleged violations of laws to fight fraud in ""loan and credit applications"" and prohibit various false statements. Cayer, however, said the first law has been applied ""consistently"" to ""traditional customer related bank activities such as loans,"" and thus did not cover securities purchases. He also said the government failed to show as required that any false statements were ""material"" to the Federal Housing Finance Board, which regulated the FHLB-San Francisco, or that either of those entities ever complained. Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the Charlotte-based bank is pleased with the recommendation. The bank had accused the Justice Department of stretching FIRREA beyond recognition to create ""an unprecedented, new regime for regulating securities - in addition to and inevitably inconsistent with the federal securities laws."" U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn will now review Cayer's recommendation. While magistrate judges' recommendations do not bind district judges, they are often followed. Cayer's recommendation does not affect a related lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On Wednesday, Bank of America agreed to pay $6.3 billion in cash to resolve lawsuits over the sale of defective mortgage securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Since 2010, Bank of America has agreed to pay well over $50 billion to settle legal and other claims stemming from the nation's housing and financial crises. Much of that sum, including part of Wednesday's settlement, is linked to Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch & Co, both of which Bank of America bought. The North Carolina cases relate to the bank's own alleged misconduct. The case is U.S. v. Bank of America Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of North Carolina, No. 13-00446.

This transformative $70.3 million project, co-developed by A Community of Friends and U.S. VETS, is dedicated to providing quality housing for formerly homeless veterans, as well as low-income veterans and their families. Ventura Springs received a $1 million grant from FHLBank San Francisco’s Affordable Housing Program (AHP) in 2023 through its member institution Bank of America California, N.A. The development features 122 affordable housing units spread across 11 buildings on the 10-acre site, designed as a traditional family-oriented community. Ventura Springs will offer a welcoming pedestrian-friendly environment with sidewalks lined with residential front doors that will contribute to a sense of community. Beyond its focus on quality housing, the site features a range of onsite amenities carefully designed to support and enhance the health and well-being of residents and encourage community engagement. “One of the greatest challenges facing the Central Coast is the high cost of housing and the lack of housing options in our communities,” said Congressman Carbajal. “That’s why I’m so glad to see federal, state, local, and public-private partnerships – including FHLBank San Francisco – all working hand-in-hand to create more than 100 new units in Ventura. As a veteran myself, I’m particularly glad to see new housing helping those who served our nation and their families. I appreciate getting the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look at these new units and look forward to seeing Ventura Springs open to the first move-ins later this year.” Addressing the critical need for additional affordable housing is an important focus for FHLBank San Francisco, particularly for our nation's veterans. In June 2023, the Bank provided $2.3 million to support veteran housing in West Los Angeles. “We are extremely proud to make a lasting positive impact on the lives of veterans who have served our country,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, President and CEO of FHLBank San Francisco. “Ventura Springs reflects our commitment to affordable housing and community development, and we appreciate the leadership of Congressman Carbajal in bringing this project to life. By supporting this project, we are providing both essential housing for our nation's veterans and their families, and also upholding the values of service and sacrifice that define our military. We are grateful to the collaborative efforts of A Community of Friends and U.S. VETS, and for the unwavering support of the Ventura community.” AHP is a core component of the Bank’s overall mission of partnering with its member institutions to make communities more vibrant, equitable, and resilient. Since 1990, FHLBank San Francisco has awarded $1.3 billion in AHP grants, creating over 150,000 units of quality affordable housing.

Announced in April this year, the honor was formally bestowed at a luncheon at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero, and the event provided an opportunity for Bazemore to share her professional journey and leadership perspectives in a fireside chat with guest moderator Nandita Bakhshi, a special advisor and board member at BMO Financial Group and the former CEO of Bank of the West. Financial Women of San Francisco recognized Bazemore for her career-long dedication to “strengthening communities and making a difference in peoples’ lives.” For more than 30 years, Bazemore has worked to ensure individuals and families—particularly low-to-moderate-income people and people of color—have a place to call home and have an opportunity to build wealth through homeownership. “We congratulate Teresa on her well-deserved recognition from Financial Women of San Francisco,” said Greg Ward, chief operating officer of FHLBank San Francisco. “She is an inspiration to us each day through both her unwavering commitment to our organization’s mission and her dedication to bringing about meaningful systemic change. She is a true role model in the finance industry—not just for women but for all professionals.” Appointed to her current role at FHLBank San Francisco in 2021, Bazemore has steadfastly pursued the Bank’s mission to provide its members with reliable access to low-cost liquidity, essential financial services and expertise, and resources for affordable housing and economic development—all in an effort to make the Arizona, California, and Nevada communities the Bank and its members collectively serve more vibrant, equitable, and resilient. Concurrently, she has spearheaded numerous initiatives to close the racial gap in homeownership and bring about systemic change, including establishing the Racial Equity Accelerator in partnership with Urban Institute and launching the Empowering Black Homeownership matching grant pilot program. During the award luncheon, Bazemore shared key moments that shaped her career, her priorities, and her leadership approach. She touched on her tenure at Radian Guaranty, a mortgage insurer, during the 2008 financial crisis, which drove a heightened focus on credit risk. Additionally, the organization was an early champion of lowering downpayment requirements on conventional mortgages, which has helped to bring homeownership within reach for more Americans. Bazemore and Bakhshi spoke to the important role that strong female role models and mentorship play in career development, reinforcing how being active in trade and networking organizations, like FWSF, can help women in the industry advance their careers. “We all have the ability to make a difference for others,” said Denise Rigli, president of Financial Women of San Francisco. “Mentors like Teresa and scholarships offered by Financial Women of San Francisco pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future for the finance industry. Together, we are building a legacy of opportunity, equity, and belonging.” Financial Women of San Francisco serves to advance the success of women in finance in the Bay Area and established the Financial Woman of the Year award in 1996 as a celebration of its 40th anniversary. Through its annual luncheon event, the organization honors women with exceptional leadership careers in finance while also raising funds for its FWSF Scholarship Fund (a 501(c)3 nonprofit) for college women in the Bay Area and increasing overall awareness of its purpose and mission. The event serves as a platform for high-achieving honorees, such as Bazemore, to share their experiences and inspire other women in their own careers and ambitions.

This year's funding represents a 100% increase over the program’s inaugural year funding in 2022. With participation by FHLBank San Francisco member institutions in Arizona, California, and Nevada, the 2023 program has the potential to deploy up to $4 million to increase Black homeownership and help bridge the racial wealth gap. “We are encouraged by the impact our Empowering Black Homeownership funding, delivered in partnership with our generous member financial institutions, has made in the communities we serve,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, president and CEO of FHLBank San Francisco. “Historical and systemic discrimination has resulted in a stark disparity in the rates of Black homeownership, which has consequently restricted the accumulation of generational wealth for millions of Black families. We are resolute in our commitment to working alongside our member institutions on developing market-based solutions to address this issue. We are proud to double our commitment to this transformative program, and we look forward to matching up to $2 million in grants aimed at supporting Black community members on their path to reaching and sustaining homeownership and economic security.” The Empowering Black Homeownership program is one component of FHLBank San Francisco’s commitment to advancing racial equity. Beginning in 2021, the Bank invested $1.5 million in a collaboration with the Urban Institute to create the Racial Equity Accelerator for Homeownership. The research conducted for that initiative highlighted the critical need for more solutions to equitable homeownership and wealth building opportunities for people of color. To that end, the Empowering Black Homeownership matching grant program was created in 2022 to allow FHLBank San Francisco member financial institutions to request dollar-for-dollar matching grants up to a total of $125,000 per member. The grants are made to HCAs and used for HUD-eligible activities, including staffing, marketing, and pre- and post-purchase counseling to propel Black homeownership and bolster intergenerational wealth building. In the first year of the program, several member institutions awarded grants to 22 local HCAs, which paired with the Bank’s match funding, resulted in $2.2 million towards advancing Black homeownership. The member institutions who participated in 2022 included: Bank of the West, Citizens Business Bank, City National Bank, Farmers & Merchants Bank of Long Beach, Luther Burbank Savings, Mechanics Bank, MUFG Union Bank, Pacific Premier Bank, Pacific Western Bank, Toyota Financial Savings Bank, Tri Counties Bank, and Western Alliance Bank. The Empowering Black Homeownership matching grant program is just one example of the Bank's mission of promoting homeownership. A separate, ongoing homeownership program – the WISH Program – is designed to support first-time homebuyers with $4-to-$1 matching grants that can be applied to downpayment and closing costs. Importantly, WISH grants require participants, such as new homeowner and WISH grant recipient Doris Ealy, to successfully complete a homebuyer counseling program to prepare them for homeownership, guiding them though the buying process, and what to expect post-purchase. One HCA that provides these services in conjunction with both the Bank’s WISH and Empowering Black Homeownership grant programs is Neighborhood Housing Services of Los Angeles County (NHS). NHS received one of the first Empowering Black Homeownership grants in 2022, through FHLBank San Francisco member Luther Burbank Savings, which when matched dollar-by-dollar by the Bank totaled $70,000. “NHS has witnessed countless lives transformed by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco’s commitment to supporting affordable homeownership,” said Lori Gay, president and CEO at Neighborhood Housing Services of Los Angeles County and a member of FHLBank San Francisco’s board of directors. “We’re thrilled that the Empowering Black Homeownership initiative is being renewed and we know it will continue to help Black families and individuals succeed in achieving future homeownership. We know that the key to generational wealth building is to own a home affordably. We welcome the commitment of the Bank and its members to helping communities of color flourish through empowerment and opportunity.” FHLBank of San Francisco’s member institutions will be able to begin requesting matching Empowering Black Homeownership grants for HCAs in their communities on September 25, 2023.

Horsford, the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, spoke at the Bank’s Innovations in Mortgage Finance Symposium and celebrated the Bank’s announcement to accept VantageScore 4.0 for mortgage collateral originated by its lenders. “We appreciate Congressman Horsford celebrating our work that aims to help many underserved borrowers who have been left out by conventional models reach their dreams of owning a home and building wealth for themselves and their families,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, President and CEO of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. “At FHLBank San Francisco, we are dedicated to narrowing the black homeownership gap and breaking down systemic barriers to financial inclusion.” In recent public comments, Congressman Horsford, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, emphasized the significance of homeownership in building intergenerational wealth. He underscored that homeownership not only facilitates financial stability but also serves as a pathway for families to pass on wealth to future generations, thereby reshaping the path to economic empowerment. “Homeownership is one of the most meaningful and substantive ways that families build intergenerational wealth in America,” said Congressman Horsford. “When we have homeownership, not only is there money to send our children to college, but it also ensures that wealth can be passed on and helps give our children the opportunity to start their lives differently than many of us.” About the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco is a member-driven cooperative helping local lenders in Arizona, California, and Nevada build strong communities, create opportunity, and change lives for the better. The tools and resources we provide to our member financial institutions — commercial banks, credit unions, industrial loan companies, savings institutions, insurance companies, and community development financial institutions — propel homeownership, finance quality affordable housing, boost economic vitality, and revitalize whole neighborhoods.

At the symposium, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco announcedthat they will accept alternatives to credit scores for low-to-moderate income families, so they can use their rent history, phone bill, and other important items that aren’t a factor in the traditional FICO scores. This action will expand access to affordable mortgages to those who, due to systemic factors outside of their control, have little to no credit history and have before now been unable to access affordable financing to achieve the American dream of homeownership.

I’m proud to represent Nevada’s Fourth Congressional District, and I’m pleased to welcome all of you to the Innovators in Mortgage Finance Symposium, hosted by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and the Urban Institute. Today’s event is important to me because, as Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, this year my focus is on closing the racial wealth gap and building intergenerational wealth in all of our communities, particularly Black communities. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I am fortunate to work on legislation that would expand access to homeownership. One of the barriers to affordable mortgage financing in communities like those that I represent in North Las Vegas has been the historic lack of credit history in underserved communities. Due to systemic factors outside of their individuals’ control, many people with little or no credit history have been unable to access affordable financing to achieve a part of the American dream. But the magnitude of the crisis that we face today is too great for any single solution. We must use every tool in our toolbox to help close the racial wealth gap. Homeownership is one of the most meaningful and substantive ways that families build intergenerational wealth in America. When we have homeownership, not only is there money to send our children to college, but it also ensures that wealth can be passed on and helps give our children the opportunity to start their lives differently than many of us. I’m grateful to the stakeholders and leaders who are gathered here today who are investing in, exploring, and promoting innovative solutions available to everyone, especially for those who have been systematically denied these opportunities in the past. I’m proud to support approaches that maintain close coordination between the public and private sectors to continue building wealth in our communities. And I am excited to see the results that will be produced by the innovators here, who are committed to advancing racial equity. I believe that your work and this research will help rewrite the rules on wealth building. Thank you again to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and to your member financial institutions’ commitment to real results. I am eager to see the further progress made at the symposium. Thank you for your continued partnership.",https://horsford.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/horsford.house.gov/files/styles/evo_image_medium_480/public/evo-media-image/2024.01.31%20Innovation%20in%20Mortgage%20Finance%20Symposium.png?h=6265599d&itok=yj-PgJ0k,2024-02-13,0.578,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'WASHINGTON', 'latitude': 38.895111083984375, 'longitude': -77.03636932373047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Black', 'latitude': 38.467830657958984, 'longitude': -88.10282135009766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 42.75035858154297, 'longitude': -71.83702087402344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'FICO', 'latitude': 4.298900127410889, 'longitude': 9.717599868774414, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nevada', 'latitude': 39.25020980834961, 'longitude': -116.75119018554688, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Institute', 'latitude': 32.33570098876953, 'longitude': -90.63066101074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chair', 'latitude': 43.31666946411133, 'longitude': 25.933330535888672, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'House', 'latitude': 34.646728515625, 'longitude': -103.90441131591797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Committee', 'latitude': -33.15781021118164, 'longitude': 26.832590103149414, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'North Las Vegas', 'latitude': 36.19886016845703, 'longitude': -115.11750030517578, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]","The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco announced at the Innovations in Mortgage Finance Symposium that they will accept alternatives to credit scores for low-to-moderate income families, allowing them to use rent history, phone bills, and other factors to qualify for affordable mortgages."

An FHFA Office of the Inspector General report last Friday found that Home Loan banks ""failed to meet existing expectations"" in the lead-up to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank and Signature earlier this year. Bloomberg News Examiners with the Federal Housing Finance Agency went into overdrive in February after crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank had tapped the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco for billions in cash. By the end of March, after a run on deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, the Home Loan Bank System would end up pumping nearly half-a-trillion dollars to stave off a systemwide liquidity crisis. In a report Friday, the FHFA's Office of Inspector General described in broad terms how borrowings by Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank raised red flags that the Federal Home Loan Bank System was taking on too much risk. After the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the FHFA launched a special credit review of six Federal Home Loan banks and of ""certain"" unnamed member banks that were under stress, according to the 19-page OIG report. By May, when a fourth bank, First Republic Bank, had shut down, the system had provided more than $30 billion in cash advances to failed institutions just months before their collapse. Each of the 11 Federal Home Loan banks will be sent a supervisory letter and an advisory bulletin on bank credit risk from FHFA — their primary regulator — according to the report. FHFA also has issued new supervisory guidance on how the Home Loan banks should assess credit risks particularly of distressed banks. ""Examiners had suspicions across the system about the FHLBanks' evaluation of their members' interest rate risk and liquidity risk management. That work is being informed by examiners' views of the FHLBanks' failure to meet existing expectations,"" the report stated. ""The collapses drew scrutiny … into the FHLBanks' member credit risk management practices and, more broadly, into the system's role in lending to troubled members."" It is unclear whether the FHFA's findings have led to downgrades in the supervisory ratings of any of the Home Loan banks. While supervisory ratings are confidential, the FHFA does include in its annual report to Congress comments on issues faced by individual banks. The OIG report comes at a particularly precarious time for the Home Loan Bank System. The FHFA is expected to release an anxiously awaited report from FHFA Director Sandra Thompson on the structure, mission and future of the Home Loan Bank System this week, and will likely include dozens of policy recommendations for Congress. Last year, Thompson launched a holistic review of the system, the first in 90 years. A major concern for regulators is that the Home Loan banks have a ""super lien"" priority ahead of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and other creditors when a bank fails. The Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, the trade group for the system, declined to comment. In February, the FHFA questioned management at the Home Loan Bank of San Francisco after a report that crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank, in La Jolla, Calif., had received $4.3 billion in cash advances last year. Silvergate, which self-liquidated after fully repaying the loan, had pledged government-backed securities to obtain the cash, raising concerns among critics that cash advances from the Home Loan banks come with few restrictions on how the funds are used to shore up a bank's balance sheet. The OIG report described how examiners responded. ""A large member bank of one FHLBank experienced unprecedented increases in its asset growth due to its involvement in the cryptocurrency market,"" the report stated. ""In late 2022, the member bank suffered wide-spread and continuous deposit withdrawals. Despite the balance sheet contraction, the FHLBank did not timely halt the member bank's borrowing or properly adjust the member bank's credit quality rating to reflect the increased credit risk,"" the report stated. Regulation and compliance Are Federal Home Loan Bank advances a sign of distress? April 17, 2023 9:00 PM Further, FHFA supervisors met with the Home Loan banks' management team in February ""to stress the Agency's discomfort with the member bank's financial condition and the FHLBank's risk management of the member bank,"" the report stated. The examiner-in-charge then updated the Home Loan bank's supervisory strategy ""to reflect the market disruption and the weakness of the member bank."" In August, Teresa Bryce Bazemore, president and CEO of the Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, announced she will retire next year, citing personal reasons. The OIG report also describes how FHFA's supervisory division scrambled to reallocate resources to examine those Home Loan banks ""most affected by the disruption and undertook deep dives into credit risk management at those institutions."" The report said supervisors took the unusual step of deploying a larger team to review Home Loan banks and began focusing on credit risk management and on its cash advance practices. Credit risk is expected to be a supervisory priority for the FHFA in 2024, the OIG report said. The OIG report also offered some insights into how FHFA responded to the run on deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and the rush by banks of all sizes to raise cash. The outsize role played by the Home Loan Bank System in shoring up the balance sheets of hundreds of banks this year has sparked criticism that banks are using the system as an easy-money alternative, allowing troubled institutions to bypass the Federal Reserve's discount window when they need liquidity. The system of 11 regional banks operate as private cooperatives that are owned by the system's 6,500 members that include banks, credit unions and insurance companies. The system's Office of Finance — its capital markets hub — issues bonds that come with an implied government guarantee. The bonds fund cash loans, known as ""advances,"" to its members.

Through a collaboration with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLBank San Francisco) and its AHEAD economic development grant program, BAC Community Bank helped to provide $70,000 in funding to Antioch’s Opportunity Junction for the expansion of its mental health services. “It is a privilege to stand by Opportunity Junction and other grassroots community organizations,” said Dana Bockstahler, BAC Community Bank CEO. “We are honored to assist in providing the vital financial support that fuels their unwavering dedication to making a positive impact on local lives.” With a mission to “help motivated Contra Costa County job seekers develop the skills and confidence to launch careers that lead to financial security,” Opportunity Junction provides no-cost job training and wraparound support to income-eligible individuals with barriers to employment. Opportunity Junction President and CEO Brianna Robinson said her organization’s Administrative Careers Training program has offered mental health services to participants since 2003, but this BAC Community Bank-sponsored grant will now make those services available to all individuals enrolled in the Healthcare Career Pathway and Career Counseling and Placement Assistance programs. “We are deeply grateful for this support,” Robinson continued. “We recognized in 2003 that addressing trauma was critical to helping job seekers overcome barriers to employment. As we have grown over the years and added more programs, we are excited to offer these services to all our job seekers with the goal of supporting high graduation and employment retention rates.” The AHEAD program enables FHLBank San Francisco members like BAC Community Bank to give a critical boost to local programs and projects that target pressing community needs and bring greater opportunity to underserved populations. AHEAD grants are awarded annually and delivered through FHLBank San Francisco member financial institutions to local community organizations for projects and programs that benefit lower-income and underserved communities. Since the program’s inception in 2004, FHLBank San Francisco has awarded more than $25 million in AHEAD grants to over 800 economic development projects in Arizona, California and Nevada. In 2023, the FHLBank San Francisco board of directors allocated $4 million to the AHEAD program, more than doubling the funding in prior years, and awarded grants to 75 projects. BAC Community Bank applied for the grant in partnership with Opportunity Junction and was awarded the $70,000 after a competitive selection process. This is the fourth year that BAC Community Bank has participated in the program. “Each year, we are inspired by the wide range of impactful programs that are brought to us by our member institutions through the AHEAD grant program,” said Eric Cicourel, FHLBank San Francisco senior vice president and community investment officer. “We were particularly encouraged by the large number of unique members who participated in this cycle, including BAC Community Bank. These financial institutions are pillars in their communities and have an intimate understanding of the needs of the communities they serve. We are proud to partner with our members to extend a lifeline to so many compelling and deserving organizations.” For those interested in applying for the AHEAD Program in 2024, please contact BAC Community Bank or visit the FHLBank San Francisco website at www.fhlbsf.com to learn more.

Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Announces First Quarter 2023 Operating Results - GlobeNewswire,Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Announces First Quarter 2023 Operating Results  GlobeNewswire,"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMy8wNC8yNy8yNjU3MDI1LzI5ODI1L2VuL0ZlZGVyYWwtSG9tZS1Mb2FuLUJhbmstb2YtU2FuLUZyYW5jaXNjby1Bbm5vdW5jZXMtRmlyc3QtUXVhcnRlci0yMDIzLU9wZXJhdGluZy1SZXN1bHRzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,GlobeNewswire,"SAN FRANCISCO, April 27, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (Bank) today announced first quarter 2023 operating results. Net income for the first quarter of 2023 was $195 million, an increase of $117 million compared with net income of $78 million for the first quarter of 2022. Net income for the first quarter of 2023 included $43 million of income resulting from higher advance prepayments relative to the prior year, net of fair value adjustments on interest rate swaps. “The first quarter was a period of significant turmoil in the banking sector and across the U.S. economy and our member-owned Bank was an important and necessary calming force, providing vital liquidity that helped stabilize financial institutions in our three-state district,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, president and chief executive officer of FHLBank San Francisco. “By relentlessly focusing on our mission, we provide critical funding and risk management tools so that our members can consistently and reliably – day in and day out – offer their customers access to mortgages, small business loans, and community development resources, which serve to propel homeownership, finance affordable housing, drive economic growth, and revitalize communities.” The $117 million increase in net income for the first quarter of 2023, relative to the prior-year period, was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income for the quarter of $184 million, partially offset by a decline in other income/(loss) of $44 million. The $184 million increase in net interest income for the quarter was primarily attributable to higher yields on higher average balances of advances and investments, partially offset by higher interest costs on higher funding levels. The increase in net interest income was also attributable to the increase of $97 million in net advance prepayment fees.The $44 million decline in other income/(loss) for the quarter was primarily attributable to an increase of $42 million in net losses from derivatives, mainly attributable to interest rate swaps economically hedging advances prepaid during the quarter, partially offset by an increase of $22 million in net fair value gains associated with financial instruments carried at fair value. The decline in other income/(loss) was also attributable to $28 million in settlement proceeds received in the first quarter of 2022 from the final resolution of putback litigation (to which the Bank was not a party). There was no similar activity during the first quarter of 2023. At March 31, 2023, total assets were $142.5 billion, an increase of $21.4 billion from $121.1 billion at December 31, 2022. Advances increased to $101.5 billion at March 31, 2023, from $89.4 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $12.1 billion, as member demand for advances continued to increase. During the quarter, advance balances reached higher levels than the balance at March 31, 2023. Total investments increased by $9.4 billion to $39.7 billion at March 31, 2023, from $30.3 billion at December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to liquidity management in connection with advances growth. The increase in investments was largely the result of increases of $4.7 billion in federal funds sold, $4.1 billion in securities purchased under agreements to resell, and $0.5 billion in mortgage-backed securities. As of March 31, 2023, the Bank complied with all regulatory capital requirements. The Bank exceeded its 4.0% regulatory requirement with a regulatory capital ratio of 5.8% at March 31, 2023. The decline in the regulatory capital ratio from 6.4% at December 31, 2022, was mainly attributable to an increase in total assets. The Bank also exceeded its risk-based capital requirement of $1.1 billion with $8.2 billion in permanent capital. Total retained earnings increased to $4.1 billion as of March 31, 2023, from $4.0 billion at yearend 2022. Today, the Bank’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the average capital stock outstanding during the first quarter of 2023 at an annualized rate of 7.00%. The quarterly dividend rate is consistent with the Bank's dividend philosophy of endeavoring to pay a quarterly dividend at a rate between 5% and 7% annualized. The quarterly dividend will total $67 million, and the Bank expects to pay the dividend on May 11, 2023. Financial Highlights(Unaudited)(Dollars in millions) Investments consist of Federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits, trading securities, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities, and securities purchased under agreements to resell.The regulatory capital ratio is calculated as regulatory capital divided by total assets. Regulatory capital includes retained earnings, Class B capital stock, and mandatorily redeemable capital stock (which is classified as a liability) but excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Total regulatory capital as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, was $8.2 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively.Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income (annualized) divided by average interest-earning assets.Cash dividend declared, recorded, and paid during the period, on the average capital stock outstanding during the previous quarter.

Cortez Masto also discussed her comprehensive work to support more housing for working families, including her new legislation to significantly increase the amount of federal funds available for RHA and affordable housing construction across the country. “Our service members have sacrificed so much for our country, and I was glad to join RHA today to see how funding I helped deliver will provide Northern Nevada veterans with accessible, affordable homes,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “But there is more work to do, and that’s why I’m pushing new legislation to provide resources to build more affordable housing and ensure hardworking families can stay in their homes.” “The Reno Housing Authority is appreciative of the efforts put forth by Sen. Cortez Masto to move the needle on affordable housing in our region. She recognizes the acute need and is helping grow funding opportunities for not only housing authorities like ours, but the entire affordable housing community,” said RHA Commissioner Kathleen Taylor. Senator Cortez Masto has been a leader in the fight to lower housing costs and keep Nevadans in their homes. As Attorney General, she led the fight to hold Big Banks accountable for the foreclosure crisis, delivering $1.9 billion to homeowners in Nevada. Last year, she secured more than $4.8 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to support Nevada affordable housing organizations, and cut through red tape to make it easier to build affordable housing across the state. She helped create the Preservation and Reinvestment Initiative for Community Enhancement (PRICE) grant program in 2022 to help preserve and revitalize manufactured housing in eligible communities, and is working to make it permanent. She is also a sponsor of the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act and the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act to help build more affordable housing.",https://www.cortezmasto.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CCM-housing-1024x768.jpg,2024-01-26,0.305,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reno', 'latitude': 39.52962875366211, 'longitude': -119.81379699707031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nev', 'latitude': 7.083330154418945, 'longitude': 8.716670036315918, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'RHA', 'latitude': 11.25841999053955, 'longitude': 15.24921989440918, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nevada', 'latitude': 39.25020980834961, 'longitude': -116.75119018554688, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",Not-related content.
Is AI the End-All Solution to Mortgage Lending Inequities? - The MReport,Is AI the End-All Solution to Mortgage Lending Inequities?  The MReport,"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbXJlcG9ydC5jb20vbmV3cy9kYXRhLzExLTA3LTIwMjMvaXMtYWktdGhl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The MReport,"A new article jointly authored by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and the Urban Institute takes a look at new research on the effects Artificial Intelligence (AI) in helping level the playing field for minorities and borrowers of color with the ultimate goal of advancing racial equity in homeownership. According to the authors, the Black/White homeownership gap is wider today than it was at the height of segregation in the 1960s, coming in at nearly 30 percentage points higher, but that number may be at a crossroads due to the rapid adoption of AI. Sourcing information from a new research paper entitled “Harnessing AI for Equity in Mortgage Finance,” explores how AI could be the solution to shifting the mortgage and homeowning industry toward promoting greater equity in the mortgage financing process and close the homeownership gap which has been perpetuated by long-standing bias (or unconscious biases) that persist in the wealth-building capabilities of people of color. The authors also cite a report from the FHL Bank of San Francisco called “Racial Equity Accelerator for Homeownership” which considers the benefits of AI on the mortgage finance industry—but cautions that adoption is still in its infancy, and the time to set goals, standards, and biases of this new technology is now before it’s adopted on a larger scale and amplified to every facet of lending. “AI and the potential disruption in its wake have been the subject of many conversations, and this latest paper underlines the importance of getting ahead of the technology and harnessing it to advance equitable outcomes in our society,” said Janneke Ratcliffe, VP of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute. “We cannot afford to wait and see how stakeholders will implement AI in their processes; we should act now to establish guidelines and guardrails to ensure that Black and Latino households are supported in their pursuit of homeownership.” Teresa Bryce Bazemore, President and CEO of FHLBank San Francisco, agrees: “AI has the potential to revolutionize processes in the mortgage finance industry, not only introducing greater efficiency and customization but also promoting greater equity in homeownership. However, it will only deliver the desired results if, and only if, data and algorithms are free of bias. If not, Black and Latino individuals and families will continue to be at a disadvantage when it comes to building equity and stability and, ultimately, intergenerational wealth. That outcome is simply unacceptable.” The authors of the paper gathered their information from nearly 50 individuals in the Federal Government, financial technology firms, mortgage lending companies, consumer advocacy groups, and research organizations. In the report, the authors describe AI’s penetration across mortgage application process and around the mortgage industry ecosystem. The adoption of AI was found to vary within the mortgage finance industry, with larger mortgage lenders, fintech firms, and government-sponsored enterprises already implementing AI in functions such as underwriting, property valuations, fraud detection, and marketing. In contrast, adoption is lower among smaller and mission-oriented lenders, such as minority depository institutions (MDIs) and community development financial institutions (CDFIs). The authors conclude, that based on their findings in the mortgage finance ecosystem, they provide three distinct recommendations: First, increased regulatory guidance is recommended to establish clear guidelines on applications and protect the rights of consumers. Second, intentional design must be the backbone of any AI model to ensure algorithms are free of bias and centered on equity. Finally, pilot programs should be implemented to test models and ensure that industry and consumer outcomes are consistent with intentions and support equity in homeownership. “Harnessing AI for Equity in Mortgage Finance” is the last in a series of four reports developed through a two-year, $1.5 million collaboration between the Urban Institute and FHLBank San Francisco. Previous reports examined incorporating alternative data into mortgage underwriting, mitigating the impact of student loan debt on Black homeownership, and using mortgage reserve accounts to help sustain homeownership.

That means you could find some wide-open spaces depending on which city or town you choose to live in, from nationally renowned Las Vegas to the state capital Carson City, and a diverse array of industries, from aerospace and mining to gaming and tourism. You could also find some first-time homebuyer loans and programs in Nevada to make getting into a house a little easier. The Nevada Housing Division can be an important resource. The agency was created by the state in 1975 to help low- and moderate-income families and individuals secure affordable housing. Nevada first-time homebuyer programs NHD Home Is Possible for First-Time Home Buyers The Nevada Housing Division’s (NHD) “Home Is Possible” (HIP) programs help homebuyers with obtaining a mortgage and down payment and closing cost assistance. Among the Home Is Possible programs is a mortgage specifically for first-time homebuyers, which comes with down payment assistance of up to 4 percent of the total loan amount as a second mortgage. A first-time buyer under this program is someone who has not owned a home in the past three years. You can work with one of more than 80 approved mortgage lenders throughout the state to determine your eligibility for the program, which comes with either an FHA, VA or USDA loan (no conventional loans). Borrower requirements: 640 minimum credit score Maximum 50 percent debt-to-income (DTI) ratio Must complete a free online homebuyer education course Must meet NHD income limits, which depend on the county The lowest income limit is $88,100 for two or fewer people in Churchill, Esmeralda, Lincoln, Lyon, Mineral, Nye, Pershing and White Pine counties. And the highest limit is $131,860 for three or more people in Storey and Washoe counties. Property requirements: Must be in Nevada Must be a primary residence Must meet NHD purchase price limits, which vary by county and range from $481,176 to $670,545 The Nevada Housing Division website offers a way to find a HIP lender to get started. NHD Home Is Possible for Teachers Available through June 30, 2024, this additional Home Is Possible program for educators gives kindergarten through 12th-grade teachers in Nevada $7,500 for the down payment or closing costs for a home, as well as a below-market rate on a mortgage. There is no first-time homebuyer requirement for this program, but you must not own property at the time of closing and you must live in the home as your primary residence. The loan is forgivable after five years if you stay in the home. Other requirements include: Income below $140,000 as a single borrower 660 minimum credit score for an FHA loan 640 minimum credit score for a VA or USDA loan 680 minimum credit score for a manufactured home Maximum 50 percent debt-to-income (DTI) ratio One-time fee of $755 on the first mortgage Take a homebuyer education course Maximum purchase price is $766,550 Nevada down payment assistance NHD Home First The NHD Home First program offers up to $15,000 in down payment support, though the funds can’t be used for closing costs. The loan is forgivable after three years if you stay in the home and is available to borrowers meeting the following requirements: Must be a first-time homebuyer (can’t have owned a home in the last three years) Nevada resident for at least six months 640 minimum credit score Must complete an online homebuyer education course Income must fall within the lender’s household income limits Home At Last Down Payment Assistance The “Home At Last” down payment assistance program from the Nevada Rural Housing Authority offers down payment assistance in the form of a three-year, interest-free, no-payment second mortgage that is forgivable after three years of living in the home as a primary residence. Income limits and credit score requirements are based on the loan product chosen — either a 30-year, fixed-rate conventional, FHA, VA or USDA loan. There are no purchase price limits for this program, though the mortgage lender can set its own limit. You also don’t need to be a first-time homebuyer to be eligible, but you must complete a free online education course and work with a participating lender to qualify. Workforce Initiative Subsidy for Homeownership (WISH) Grants Greater Nevada Mortgage, a private lender operating in Nevada and California, has partnered with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to offer a one-time 4:1 match of the borrower’s contribution toward down payment and closing costs, up to $29,172. To qualify, you must be a first-time homebuyer who meets income requirements for the program and membership criteria for the Greater Nevada Credit Union. You’ll also need to complete a homebuyer counseling program. Visit the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco’s website to learn more, and find a participating lender to get started. Middle-Income Down Payment Assistance (MDPA) Grants Greater Nevada Mortgage also offers qualifying first-time homebuyers access to a one-time 5:1 match of the borrower’s contribution to use for downpayment and closing costs up to $50,000. To be eligible, the borrower must complete a homebuyer counseling program, qualify for membership with Greater Nevada Credit Union, and fulfill income eligibility requirements (household earnings must be between 80.01 percent and 140 percent of the area median income limits). The borrower must also make a minimum contribution of $10,000, which can come from savings or a gift. Home Means Nevada Rural Down Payment Assistance On August 1, 2023, this limited-time program began offering eligible homebuyers $25,000 in forgivable down payment assistance (no closing costs). The program is available to first-time homebuyers purchasing a primary residence anywhere in rural Nevada (any community with a population under 150,000). The assistance is secured by a second loan with no payments and no interest and is forgiven in three years or on December 31, 2026, whichever comes first The program expires on December 31, 2024, or when the program runs out of funds, whichever occurs first. Visit the Nevada Rural Housing website to learn more about the program, and contact a program lender to get started. Other Nevada first-time homebuyer loans Several nationwide programs may also be helpful for homebuyers in Nevada. FHA loans: FHA loans have low minimum credit score and down payment requirements, which can be especially helpful to first-time homebuyers. FHA loans are available with credit scores as low as 580 with a 3.5 percent down payment or as low as 500 with 10 percent down. VA loans: Active-duty military members and veterans may qualify for a VA loan with a lower interest rate than conventional mortgages offer. These loans don’t require a down payment, and borrowers can have credit scores as low as 580, though minimum scores vary by lender. USDA loans: Another option is a USDA loan, part of a national program designed to help first-time homebuyers and those who don’t meet conventional mortgage requirements obtain a mortgage. These no-down payment mortgages are for low- and moderate-income borrowers in rural areas, and some borrowers qualify for a low, fixed interest rate. In Nevada, the USDA also offers its Section 502 Direct Loan Program; funded by the agency, it helps low- and very-low-income homebuyers obtain safe housing in eligible rural areas through payment assistance that increases the borrower’s repayment ability. Get started If you’re interested in buying a house in Nevada—whether you’re looking at the Las Vegas housing market or somewhere off the beaten track—be sure to visit the NHD and Nevada Rural Housing websites to learn more about available homebuyer programs. And keep in mind that several national first-time homebuyer loans and programs can help you get into a home more affordably. Now that you’re in the know on the first-time homebuyer options available in Nevada, you’re ready to get started with your home purchase. While the Nevada Housing Division doesn’t make loans or financing decisions, the agency does provide a list of preferred mortgage lenders who can help you determine what you qualify for. Regardless of which program you choose, be sure to shop for the best loan for your unique situation, and compare multiple offers to make sure you’re getting the best deal.

The developers broke ground on the project in June 2022. Other partners involved in the development of the property include the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and California Congressman Salud Carbajal. Designated for the formerly homeless and low-income veterans and their families, Ventura Springs will serve residents earning between 30 and 60 percent of the area median income. The community will also provide social, clinical and programmatic services such as career development, mental health counseling and case management. READ ALSO: Affordable Housing Outlook: What Challenges Will 2024 Pose? Encompassing 11 buildings spread across nearly 10 acres, Ventura Springs incorporates 78 one-bedroom, 32 two-bedroom and 12 three-bedroom apartments. Common-area amenities are set to include a fitness center, a business center, a playground, a community room, laundry facilities and controlled access. The pedestrian-friendly community will also feature walking trails, courtyards, picnic areas, a community garden and landscaped sitting areas. The development is coming online at 10795 Cosmos Ave. at the intersection with Telephone Road, within walking distance of the Veterans Home of California – Ventura. The public-private financing package for the $70.3 million project consists of: $55.8 million construction loan from Bank of America $2.1 million construction loan from the City of Ventura $1 million grant from Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco’s Affordable Housing Program through Bank of America California $9.4 million from California Housing & Community Development VHHP $500,000 from The Home Depot Foundation $427,000 from City of Ventura Successor Housing Agency Creating affordable options for veterans The collaboration between the developers and the other private and public partners involved in the project shows the commitment to closing the gap between supply and demand in affordable housing. Congressman Carbajal remarked in a prepared statement that some of the greatest challenges facing the Central Coast are the high cost of housing and the lack of housing options. The Ventura Springs development aims at meeting the critical need of quality and affordable housing for veterans. There were approximately 50,000 veterans living in Ventura County at the time of the project’s groundbreaking.",https://www.multihousingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2022/02/Oasis-Senior-Villas.-Image-courtesy-of-DE-Architects-e1644329651975.jpg,2024-02-02,0.614,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Calif', 'description': 'business', 'full_name': ""Société Anonyme de Credit a l'Industrie Francaise""}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ventura', 'latitude': 34.27833938598633, 'longitude': -119.29316711425781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pose', 'latitude': 4.370689868927002, 'longitude': 19.137039184570312, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Common', 'latitude': -29.116670608520508, 'longitude': 30.049999237060547, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': '10795'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cosmos Ave.'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Telephone Road'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank of America', 'latitude': 37.79444122314453, 'longitude': -122.40306091308594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'City of Ventura', 'latitude': 43.12834167480469, 'longitude': -93.46190643310547, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Central Coast', 'latitude': -33.299171447753906, 'longitude': 151.1922149658203, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ventura County', 'latitude': 34.46665954589844, 'longitude': -119.0176010131836, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]","The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco contributed $1 million to the $70.3 million Ventura Springs affordable housing project in Ventura, California.

First Republic and SVB: A tale of two failed banks - Axios,First Republic and SVB: A tale of two failed banks  Axios,"Sat, 06 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzA2L2ZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLXN2Yi1jYWxpZm9ybmlh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Axios,"Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco: SVB and FRB were its top two largest borrowers at the end of 2022, with $15 billion and $14 billion in loans outstanding, respectively. The FHLB system usually acts as a backstop to banks in need of liquidity, to help stave off collapse and contagion. Interest rates: The low-interest rate environment — and subsequent reversal in the past year — affected both companies, albeit differently. SVB’s misguided bet on a portfolio of bonds ultimately alarmed investors when it led to a $1.8 billion loss. FRB, meanwhile, took advantage of the low interest rates to give its wealthy customers sweetheart deals on home mortgages — loans that eventually were bad deals for the bank when rates went up.

Rep. Carbajal Calls Out Republican-led House for Failing to Act on Legislation Tackling California's Housing Crisis - Salud Carbajal,Rep. Carbajal Calls Out Republican-led House for Failing to Act on Legislation Tackling California's Housing Crisis  Salud Carbajal,"Fri, 01 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYmFqYWwuaG91c2UuZ292L25ld3MvZG9jdW1lbnRzaW5nbGUuYXNweD9Eb2N1bWVudElEPTE3MzPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Salud Carbajal,"Today, Congressman Salud Carbajal called on the Republican leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives to act on legislation to help mitigate high housing costs and increase access to affordable housing options in California. “The people’s House went the entire month of November without passing a bill to tackle our nation’s housing crisis,” said Rep. Carbajal. “I was sent to this chamber, by my constituents, to enact policies that will help lower those skyrocketing housing costs…there are bills that we could pass today to help, including bipartisan ones that I’ve helped write.” You can view the Congressman’s full remarks here. Rep. Carbajal has made lowering housing costs for Central Coast residents and finding solutions to California’s housing crisis a key priority of his time in Congress. Last month, he announced $550,000 in grants from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to help first-time home buyers on the Central Coast. He also in November introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at improving housing access and affordability for Central Coast veterans, the Home for the Brave Act. Earlier this year, construction on a new affordable housing community in Guadalupe began thanks in part to funding he directly secured in the 2022 federal budget. Rep. Carbajal’s work in Congress has also delivered $4 million to support the operation of the Anderson Hotel in San Luis Obispo, which provides housing options to low income individuals in the region. Rep. Carbajal is one of the co-authors of the Housing for All Act, a landmark bill that would provide ten years of new and increased funding for construction of new housing units, rental assistance, hotel and motel conversions, and more. Rep. Carbajal originally introduced the Housing for All Act in 2022 alongside California Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Ted Lieu. The Congressman’s remarks as prepared for delivery today can be found below: “Happy first day of December, Mister Speaker. I rise today to point out that the people’s House went the entire month of November without passing a bill to tackle our nation’s housing crisis. Communities on California’s Central Coast are ranked as some of the most expensive in the country to live in, and I was sent to this chamber, by my constituents, to enact policies that will help lower those skyrocketing housing costs. Congress needs to help increase availability of affordable housing options. We need to reform and expand programs that provide housing assistance; like I have been pushing to do for working families and veterans. And we need to invest in the community solutions that are helping those experiencing homelessness. Mister Speaker, there are bills that we could pass today to lend a hand, including bipartisan ones that I’ve helped write. But, by all means; let’s keep pursuing baseless impeachment inquiries, or defunding the salaries of Cabinet members that we don’t agree with.”",https://carbajal.house.gov/UploadedPhotos/MediumResolution/7da37ee2-ce5c-41fb-ba48-31cf195cf857.png,2024-02-22,0.098,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republican', 'latitude': 36.08237838745117, 'longitude': -77.0599594116211, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'House', 'latitude': 29.47385025024414, 'longitude': -95.4974365234375, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Central Coast', 'latitude': -33.299171447753906, 'longitude': 151.1922149658203, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Congress', 'latitude': 34.14611053466797, 'longitude': -112.84667205810547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Home', 'latitude': 32.86486053466797, 'longitude': -97.40042114257812, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Guadalupe', 'latitude': 25.676780700683594, 'longitude': -100.25646209716797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Anderson', 'latitude': 40.448211669921875, 'longitude': -122.29778289794922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Luis Obispo', 'latitude': 35.28274917602539, 'longitude': -120.65962219238281, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ted', 'latitude': 4.397799968719482, 'longitude': 43.908599853515625, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cabinet', 'latitude': 30.039379119873047, 'longitude': 31.236019134521484, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not-related content.

Affordable senior apartments open in LA - LA Daily News,Affordable senior apartments open in LA  LA Daily News,"Mon, 28 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8yOC9hZmZvcmRhYmxlLXNlbmlvci1hcGFydG1lbnRzLW9wZW4taW4tbGEv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA4LzI4L2FmZm9yZGFibGUtc2VuaW9yLWFwYXJ0bWVudHMtb3Blbi1pbi1sYS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,LA Daily News,"A newly built 122-unit apartment building for senior citizens opened Monday, Aug. 28, in the city of Los Angeles, with 91 of those units reserved for formerly unhoused residents. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco celebrated the grand opening of Washington View Apartments, which will provide housing to senior citizens in need. “We couldn’t be happier to be a partner in this critically important project,” Greg Ward, chief operating officer of FHLBank San Francisco, said in a statement. “This project is exactly what the bank aims to accomplish with our Affordable Housing Program and reflects our unwavering commitment to strengthening communities by helping to meet the acute need to provide stable and sustainable housing for the underserved.” The Washington View Apartments received a $1 million Affordable Housing Program grant in 2022 for its completion from the bank. According to a statement from FHLBank San Francisco, the bank has deployed more than $1.4 billion in AHP grants since 1990. In Los Angeles County, the bank has awarded a total of 509 AHP grants, totaling more than $223 million, for the construction or rehabilitation of 29,000 units of “quality affordable housing.” In 2023, the bank awarded more than $26 million AHP grants to support 30 new projects around the state of California. In the county, a total of $9.9 million supported 11 projects, such as the new construction of Cudahy Seniors, located at 4610 Santa Ana St. in Cudahy. Ward expressed his gratitude for Clearinghouse Community Development Financial Institution, a community lender and benefit “B” corporation that addresses unmet credit needs throughout the U.S., for facilitating the award of this grant. He extended his gratitude to Kamlager-Dove for her “commitment and focus on developing solutions to address the lack of affordable housing in L.A.” Kamlager-Dove is serving her inaugural term representing the 37th Congressional District, which includes several neighborhoods in downtown L.A., portions of Culver City and Inglewood, which was previously represented by Mayor Karen Bass. The congresswoman said in a statement that she was glad to celebrate the opening of the senior apartments. “Housing is a fundamental basic human right that everyone deserves access to,” Kamlager-Dove said in a statement. She noted the new apartment building will grant residents with “dignity and autonomy while also uplifting the importance of community-centered solutions through the inclusion of recreation rooms, support services spaces, access to adult education classes, and other essential resources.” According to Noami Pines of Las Palmas Housing, the nonprofit overseeing services to residents, the cost of a studio would be up to $1,425, and a one bedroom would cost up to $1,419. The cost depends son the unit set aside and on any financial assistance the applicant and nonprofit may receive, Pines noted. Tenants are expected to follow a set of house rules. If an issue arises, tenants will be offered support and assistance. “A lease violation is issued but the case management team is really focused on support and solution,” Pines said in an email to City News Service. “If it’s repeated and becomes disruptive or a risk to other residents, the scenario would be discussed as needed.” “For financial issues, repayment plans are highly organized and account for any support a tenant may need,” Pines added. Developed by WPH Holdings in partnership with Las Palmas Housing, the Washington View multifamily development transformed a historic chapel, warehouse and parking lot into affordable housing with 94 one-bedroom units, 26 studios and a pair of two-bedroom homes. The project also includes an open courtyard design, which is intended to encourage social interaction between residents. Fariba Atighehchi, president and CEO of WHP Holdings, managed the project. She said in a statement that it was something her late father dreamed of to provide affordable housing for the community. “Washington View Apartments stand as a testament to the transformative power of community-focused development to create jobs, build connections and change lives,” Atighehchi said.",https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/WASHINGTONVIEW.jpg?w=1024,2023-08-28,0.447,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Los Angeles', 'latitude': 34.05223083496094, 'longitude': -118.24368286132812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dove', 'latitude': 37.790870666503906, 'longitude': -92.68267822265625, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 42.75035858154297, 'longitude': -71.83702087402344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Los Angeles County', 'latitude': 34.366661071777344, 'longitude': -118.20091247558594, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cudahy', 'latitude': 33.9605712890625, 'longitude': -118.18534851074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': '4610'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Santa Ana St.'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ward', 'latitude': 45.96685028076172, 'longitude': -64.31543731689453, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'L.A.', 'latitude': 34.05223083496094, 'longitude': -118.24368286132812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Culver City', 'latitude': 34.0211181640625, 'longitude': -118.39646911621094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Inglewood', 'latitude': 33.9616813659668, 'longitude': -118.3531265258789, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Karen', 'latitude': 60.15388870239258, 'longitude': 21.27277946472168, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Noami', 'latitude': 6.408289909362793, 'longitude': 5.442130088806152, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Las Palmas', 'latitude': 28.099729537963867, 'longitude': -15.413430213928223, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pines', 'latitude': 39.8974609375, 'longitude': -111.55297088623047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco provided a $1 million grant for the completion of Washington View Apartments, a 122-unit affordable housing project for senior citizens in Los Angeles, including 91 units for formerly unhoused residents."
"Banks report tighter lending standards for mortgages, HELOCs in Q3 - HousingWire","Banks report tighter lending standards for mortgages, HELOCs in Q3  HousingWire","Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9iYW5rcy1yZXBvcnQtdGlnaHRlci1sZW5kaW5nLXN0YW5kYXJkcy1mb3ItbW9ydGdhZ2VzLWhlbG9jcy1pbi1xMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"Banks have tightened lending standards for most categories of residential real estate (RRE) loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC) over the third quarter of 2023. The tightening came amid elevated interest rates and uncertainty in economic conditions. A survey taken by the Federal Reserve showed that a 20%-plus share of banks reported having tightened standards on non-qualified-mortgage (non-QM) jumbo residential loans (23.9%), QM jumbo loans (26%), non-QM non-jumbo (20.4%) and HELOCs (21.8%), respectively, according to the Federal Reserve’s October 2023 senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices. Government residential mortgage was an exception, where standards remained basically unchanged. Only 4.2% of banks reported to have tightened standards on government residential mortgages, the report showed. When banks become less willing to offer credit, it can have the same effect as the central bank raising rates. Households and businesses find it more difficult and costly to borrow, which tends to limit demand for goods and services. “Banks most frequently cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook; reduced tolerance for risk; deterioration in the credit quality of loans and collateral values; and concerns about funding costs as important reasons for tightening lending standards over the third quarter,” the report said. Responses were received from 62 domestic banks and 19 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. Respondent banks received the survey on Sept. 15, 2023, and responses were due by Oct. 5, 2023. The survey, fielded quarterly by the central bank, asks loan officers about topics such as changes in lending terms as well as household demand for loans. With mortgage rates having climbed past 8% before dropping back down in the 7%-range in the third quarter, demand weakened for all RRE loan categories. A 40%-plus share of all surveyed banks said they saw weaker demand for all types of RRE loans. The seven categories of residential home-purchase loans that banks are asked to consider are GSE eligible (42.9%), government (52.1%), QM non-jumbo non-GSE-eligible (57.1%), QM jumbo (56%), non-QM jumbo (63%), non-QM non-jumbo (61.4%), and subprime mortgage loans (71.9%). While HELOCs have gained popularity as owners leveraged accumulated home equity, rising interest rates dampened the appeal. The survey showed that 30.4% of banks reported weaker demand for HELOCs as interest rates remain at a 22-year high in a range of 5.25% and 5.5%.",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/heloc-.jpg,2023-11-07,-0.163,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sept', 'latitude': 51.26667022705078, 'longitude': 4.783329963684082, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not-related content.

The community was developed in partnership with the California-based affordable housing nonprofit Las Palmas Housing. Bank of Hope provided a $33 million loan for the project’s construction, with the Los Angeles city government lending another $12 million, according to Yardi Matrix data. Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco provided a $1 million grant. The property was formerly home to the Pierce Brothers Chapel, the first full-service funeral home built in Los Angeles, and an adjoining parking lot and warehouse. The property, which had suffered two fires, was extensively damaged, but WPH Holding’s adaptive reuse process saved and rehabilitated the front of the building, its arcade and the double-height, large chapel. The project also called for rebuilding the historic bell tower and red tile roof, while the stained glass windows were repaired, restored or reconstructed. Located at 720 W. Washington Blvd., Washington View Apartments offers seniors 122 studio and one- and two-bedroom units. The developer also designated 91 of the units for formerly homeless residents. The community includes space for support services, three recreation rooms and open community space. Residents will have access to case management and adult education classes, as well as other resources. Responding to LA’s affordable housing demand Washington View Apartments bolsters WPH Holdings’ portfolio, which mostly includes affordable housing projects in California.

Change Lending keeps CDFI certification after agreement with US Treasury - HousingWire,Change Lending keeps CDFI certification after agreement with US Treasury  HousingWire,"Fri, 03 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9jaGFuZ2UtbGVuZGluZy1rZWVwcy1jZGZpLWNlcnRpZmljYXRpb24tYWZ0ZXItYWdyZWVtZW50LXdpdGgtdXMtdHJlYXN1cnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"Non-bank originator Change Lending will continue to originate non-qualified mortgages (non-QMs) for underserved borrowers after it reached a tentative deal with the U.S. Department of Treasury that would keep the firm certified as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI). The CDFI certification is a designation given by the Treasury Department CDFI Fund to specialized organizations that provide financial services to low-income communities and people who lack financing. At least 60% of a lender’s financing must target low- and moderate-income borrowers or customers in underserved communities. In a new agreement, the CDFI Fund has withdrawn its decertification of Change Lending from the CDFI Fund and, in exchange, the lender will drop its lawsuit against the Treasury Department, according to a letter sent to Change’s attorneys from the Department of Justice on Oct. 31. Change is now in good standing with the CDFI Fund and its next planned certification review is not until 2025, the originator said. “We are pleased to have resolved any misunderstandings with the CDFI Fund and appreciate the CDFI Fund’s collaborative approach and willingness to agree to this settlement in principle. We believe that today’s agreement will benefit all stakeholders. Change is proud to be certified as a CDFI and to continue our mission,” Carlos Salas, CEO of Change Lending, said in a statement. The agreement puts an end to a short-lived legal dispute with the Treasury Department. Change Lending was removed from the CDFI Fund’s list of certified program lenders in August after a Barron‘s investigation found that the lender failed to meet its underserved lending requirements in 2022. Change sued the CDFI Fund in late August claiming the Fund’s “flawed analysis and mathematical errors” led to the decertification decision. A federal judge sided with Change in September, allowing the originator to continue its mortgage offerings for underserved borrowers until at least December. Since becoming a CDFI in 2018, Change has funded more than $25 billion in loans to more than 75,000 families, according to the lender. In October, the company sued Adam Levine, CEO Steven Sugarman’s former chief of staff, after the former high-ranking employee accused the firm of retaliation when he notified executives of employees “mischaracterizing loans” to skirt federal reporting requirements. Levine was fired in March over multiple accusations of workplace misconduct. Change accused Levine of committing fraud and breaching his contract with the firm to advance his scheme to extort Change and its principals for over $10 million. In 2015, Levine’s former employer, TPG Global, also sued him for taking confidential documents and distributing them to media outlets after being denied a promotion. A federal judge that year ordered Levine to return TPG’s confidential information back to the company.",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Home-Swap-e1693823637759.jpeg,2023-11-03,-0.436,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Change', 'latitude': 27.348939895629883, 'longitude': 87.60993194580078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Department of Justice', 'latitude': 14.579360008239746, 'longitude': 120.98387145996094, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Carlos Salas', 'latitude': -35.393028259277344, 'longitude': -61.99747848510742, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Barron', 'latitude': 42.846168518066406, 'longitude': -2.992579936981201, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Levine', 'latitude': 50.002811431884766, 'longitude': -100.13278198242188, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not-related content.

The development has replaced a former wood mill with 41 affordable homes. Eden Housing partnered with Replay Resorts to head development. Eden will serve as property management for future residents. Of the 41 units, there will be eight units priced for extremely low-income households, 32 for very low-income households, and one moderate-income apartment for the on-site manager. The extremely-low housing will be reserved for project-based voucher referrals from the Sonoma County Housing Authority. The 32 low-income apartments will be chosen from the Eden lottery application waitlist. Rents for those apartments are expected to start in the low $1,100’s per month for a one-bedroom, under $1,350 for a two-bedroom, and under $1,550 for a three-bedroom. Apartment sizes will vary with 19 one-bedrooms, 11 two-bedrooms, and 11 three-bedrooms. Parking will be included for 41 cars. Bicycle parking is included, but the capacity is not specified. Residents will be offered a variety of amenities inside the building, including a community room, lounge, an open kitchen, a community garden, and an open-air courtyard. The open space will even include barbeque grills and a children’s playground for families. PYATOK Architecture + Design is responsible for the design. The four-story structure conforms to the narrow, long parcel with awnings above each window to regulate interior comfort. Vertical louver panels create a striking focal point over the outdoor landscaped plaza. The 0.86-acre parcel is located by Downtown Healdsburg, close to the Russian River and Foss Creek Pathway. Healdsburg is a northern Sonoma County city north of Santa Rosa and south of Geyserville. Funding was provided by the city, County of Sonoma, the Sonoma County Housing Authority, Replay, Wells Fargo, California Community Reinvestment Corporation, Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and California Tax Credit Allocation Committee. West Creek Builders was the general contractor responsible for building the apartments.

A new research paper titled “Harnessing AI for Equity in Mortgage Finance,” explores how AI could either shift the industry toward promoting greater equity in the mortgage financing process to close the homeownership gap or perpetuate long-standing biases that will persist in undermining the wealth-building potential of Black and Brown individuals and families. This latest report from the Racial Equity Accelerator for Homeownership, a collaboration of Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLBank San Francisco) and the Urban Institute, considers the benefits of AI for the mortgage finance industry but cautions that, with adoption still in its relative infancy, now is the time to set standards and remove biases before racial inequality is further entrenched and amplified on a larger scale than ever before. “Harnessing AI for Equity in Mortgage Finance” is a qualitative study of perspectives gleaned through interviews of key stakeholders in the mortgage ecosystem. The report’s authors note the key economic and mortgage market trends driving the need for greater innovation. However, they point out several critical challenges, starting with a lack of clarity and agreement on the definition of AI and how it specifically pertains to the mortgage finance industry. The authors also warn that AI’s promise for advancing equity in homeownership could be undermined on multiple fronts, from how algorithms are developed to the data they draw upon for training to keeping within all legal confines when incorporating considerations for race. Beyond the threat of amplifying existing racial disparities, AI poses the danger of creating new, unforeseen racial barriers within the industry. “AI and the potential disruption in its wake have been the subject of many conversations, and this latest paper underlines the importance of getting ahead of the technology and harnessing it to advance equitable outcomes in our society,” said Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute. “We cannot afford to wait and see how stakeholders will implement AI in their processes; we should act now to establish guidelines and guardrails to ensure that Black and Latino households are supported in their pursuit of homeownership.” Teresa Bryce Bazemore, president and CEO of FHLBank San Francisco, agrees: “AI has the potential to revolutionize processes in the mortgage finance industry, not only introducing greater efficiency and customization but also promoting greater equity in homeownership. However, it will only deliver the desired results if, and only if, data and algorithms are free of bias. If not, Black and Latino individuals and families will continue to be at a disadvantage when it comes to building equity and stability and, ultimately, intergenerational wealth. That outcome is simply unacceptable.” Authors of “Harnessing AI for Equity in Mortgage Finance” solicited views from nearly 50 individuals involved in federal government, financial technology, mortgage lending, consumer advocacy, and research organizations. In their report, they describe AI’s penetration both across the mortgage application process and around the mortgage industry ecosystem. The adoption of AI was found to vary within the mortgage finance industry, with larger mortgage lenders, fintech firms, and government-sponsored enterprises already implementing AI in functions such as underwriting, property valuations, fraud detection, and marketing. In contrast, adoption is lower among smaller and mission-oriented lenders, such as minority depository institutions (MDIs) and community development financial institutions (CDFIs). Based on their findings in the mortgage finance ecosystem, the authors provide three distinct recommendations. First, increased regulatory guidance is recommended to establish clear guidelines on applications and protect the rights of consumers. Second, intentional design must be the backbone of any AI models to ensure algorithms are free of bias and centered on equity. Finally, pilot programs are suggested to test models and ensure that industry and consumer outcomes are consistent with intentions and support equity in homeownership. “Harnessing AI for Equity in Mortgage Finance” is the last in a series of four reports developed through a two-year, $1.5 million collaboration between the Urban Institute and FHLBank San Francisco. Previous reports examined incorporating alternative data into mortgage underwriting, mitigating the impact of student loan debt on Black homeownership, and using mortgage reserve accounts to help sustain homeownership.

How community banks are able to compete with industry giants for deposits - MarketWatch,How community banks are able to compete with industry giants for deposits  MarketWatch,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9ob3ctY2FuLWNvbW11bml0eS1iYW5rcy1jb21wZXRlLXdpdGgtaW5kdXN0cnktZ2lhbnRzLWZvci1kZXBvc2l0cy1oZXJlcy13aGF0LXRvLWtub3ctMzY3OTRjZjfSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9ob3ctY2FuLWNvbW11bml0eS1iYW5rcy1jb21wZXRlLXdpdGgtaW5kdXN0cnktZ2lhbnRzLWZvci1kZXBvc2l0cy1oZXJlcy13aGF0LXRvLWtub3ctMzY3OTRjZjc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,MarketWatch,"The fourth institution, Signature Bank of New York, failed on March 12. It had also suffered a liquidity problem as depositors withdrew their money, and it had taken out short-term loans, known as advances, from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. But the FHLBs — there are 11 of them — do much more than provide emergency financing. As wholesale banks that are cooperatively owned by their members, which are mainly community banks, the FHLBs provide a high level of service to their members, in close cooperation with their communities, to support mortgage lending and affordable housing. So what exactly is the mission of the FHLBs, and how do they carry it out? The wholesale banks work as “service-driven organizations,” according to José R. González, the president and CEO of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. In an interview, he described a “seamless process” that allows the FHLBs to provide instant liquidity to their members. (Editor’s note: The author worked as a credit analyst at the FHLB of New York from May 1998 to July 2003.) Before being appointed president and CEO of the FHLB of New York in April 2014, González had served as vice chair of the bank’s board of directors for five years and as a director since 2004. González was also CEO of Santander BanCorp of Puerto Rico from 2002 until 2008 and served on that company’s board until 2010. The New York FHLB’s market territory includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Members of each FHLB vote to elect its directors. The FHLB system The FHLB system was created by Congress through the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, which was signed into law by President Herbert Hoover in 1932 as part of the government’s effort to shore up the U.S. mortgage-lending market during the Great Depression by providing liquidity to savings banks and savings and loans. The FHLBs were created “as a mirror image to Federal Reserve system, which only served commercial banks,” González said. The FHLBs aren’t funded with taxpayer money. Rather, they are owned by their members, which include banks, credit unions and insurance companies, along with some Community Development Financial Institutions. Members own capital stock in the banks, upon which their voting rights are based. An FHLB’s share price is fixed at $100 and the shares aren’t traded publicly. A member’s capital stock holdings in its district FHLB are based on the member’s total assets and a percentage of its borrowings from the FHLB, subject to a limit. The New York bank has a cap of $50 million on a member’s capital stock, which is the highest membership cap in the FHLB system, according to Adam Goldstein, the bank’s chief business officer. Members are paid dividends on their capital stock. The dividend yields increased last year as interest rates went up: The fourth-quarter dividend rate for shares of FHLB of New York members was an annualized 6.75%, up from 4.4% a year earlier. The FHLBs are regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which also supervises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Each bank in the system has its own market territory. After the bank failures — or planned closure, in the case of Silvergate — that came after large numbers of depositors moved their money from the regional banks to bigger banks, some commentators implied that it might have been a mistake for the FHLBs to lend to the flailing institutions. Those opinions overlook some important facts: The troubled banks were members of their respective FHLBs with credit agreements in place and had delivered collateral to secure their advances. It is part of the FHLB system’s original mission to provide liquidity to troubled institutions. There were hundreds of failures of community banks during the Depression, when the system was created. None of the FHLBs have ever taken credit losses on advances. The loans are fully secured by collateral agreements in place with every member. The FHLBs’ mission has evolved over the decades. Under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, known as FIRREA, the banks dedicate at least 10% of their profits to affordable-housing programs. This money is allocated in close cooperation with members and with housing organizations in their communities. González emphasized that supporting troubled institutions is part of the FHLBs’ dual mission to provide “liquidity and support for housing.” He also said that media reports about bank failures sometimes fail to note “the level of coordination between the FHLBs and prudential regulators during those situations.” Those prudential regulators are the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve Banks, as well as state banking departments and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which charters and supervises national banks. Collateral relationships One thing that sets the FHLBs apart from other wholesale lenders to banks is their collateral relationship with their members. The role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as purchasers of the majority of newly originated fixed-rate one- to four-unit residential loans is well known. These government-sponsored enterprises provide underwriting guidelines to lenders. Newly originated mortgage loans that meet the guidelines can be sold quickly to Fannie and Freddie, which lowers banks’ interest-rate risk. One problem that eventually led to the failure of First Republic early in May was that the bank was saddled with a large portfolio of fixed-rate jumbo-mortgage loans that had very low interest rates and couldn’t be sold to Fannie or Freddie. So banks will be eager to sell fixed-rate mortgage loans if they can, but some loans cannot be sold. Other loans with adjustable rates are retained because rate changes protect the lenders from interest-rate risk. The advantage of FHLB membership is that mortgage loans, including multifamily and commercial real-estate loans, can be listed as collateral by the members, along with securities holdings, to secure advances. All of that collateral can be turned into liquidity instantly through the FHLBs. This isn’t to say collateral cannot be pledged to other borrowers. It can. But the FHLBs’ “seamless” process allows for instant action. “We know the collateral; we know the members,” González said. “That makes this a much easier process, especially in a time like mid-March.” Accepting mortgage loans as collateral, rather than only accepting securities, is a “fundamental essence of the system,” he said. He emphasized that the FHLBs aren’t lenders of last resort. Instead, members incorporate FHLB borrowing into their business strategies, he said. One reason that FHLB members include insurance companies is that a strong secondary market for mortgage-backed securities helps improve liquidity available to mortgage borrowers. The insurers’ ability to pledge their mortgage-backed securities as collateral for FHLB advances supports the system’s mission. And advances aren’t only for short-term funding or for emergencies. Members of the FHLBs can take advantage of lower interest rates at the longer end of the yield curve right now, Goldstein said. “Additionally, for those members that choose to retain long-term mortgage production in this higher-rate environment, longer-term advances allow them to extend their liabilities and mitigate funding mismatches while locking in advantageous spreads.” The macro case for FHLBs González referred to the FHLB system as “a utility” that plays “an important role in the financial stability of the U.S. banking industry.” By supporting a group of about 6,800 financial institutions, the system makes it easier for the smaller banks to survive. And that diversity of lenders means stronger local knowledge of economic conditions. “We are an industry-capitalized, industry-funded support system for liquidity before you hit the central bank,” González said. “We prevent many cases from getting to the last resort,” which would be borrowing from the Federal Reserve — or failing. “Banking is a risky businesses,” he added. “There are always failures that come in waves. But we are essentially a risk mitigant to those waves.” The FHLBs raise money to fund advances as a group through the FHLBanks Office of Finance. Operating as a group gives the system an advantage — high investment-grade ratings from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. “The 11 banks are jointly and severally liable for the debt we issue,” González said. “It is the second-largest fixed-income debt franchise in the world after the U.S. Treasury — a strong well-recognized debt franchise with global investors who recognize it as one of the premier issuers in the world.” During the first quarter, FHLB advances to members increased 27% to a record $1.04 trillion, according to Freddie Strickland, vice president of equity research at Janney Montgomery Scott. In a note to clients on May 18, Strickland wrote: “Despite a higher level of advances, the primary capital measurement used by the FHLBs’ regulator reflects better capital levels systemwide compared to [the fourth quarter of 2019] (pre-pandemic) on a median basis (and for 6 of the 11 FHLBs individually).” That group of six FHLBs includes the New York bank, according to Janney’s data. Strickland added that “every single FHLB is in a better capital position today versus the previous … peak in FHLB advances” in the third quarter of 2008. Partnerships with members As part of the ordinary course of business, the FHLBs maintain strong relationships with member institutions. This includes regular visits by calling officers who develop detailed knowledge of local economic conditions. “That relationship doesn’t end with the members. It extends to regulators,” said Goldstein, who chairs the FHLB system’s Regulatory Outreach Committee, which fosters engagement with the member institutions’ regulators at all levels. “It is all connected because we share what we are hearing in our districts,” he said. Municipal deposits are an important source of funding for community banks. Counties, school districts and other government entities receive seasonal influxes of cash — in amounts far in excess of the FDIC’s deposit-insurance thresholds — which is deposited in demand-deposit accounts at banks. All 11 FHLBs can issue letters of credit on behalf of their member institutions to municipal entities, guaranteeing their balances on deposit with the members. These letters of credit are backed by the members’ collateral that has already been pledged. This provides an extra layer of protection for the depositors, enabling smaller members to compete against the largest banks for these deposits. Goldstein described the municipal letters of credit as “a prime example of how our ability to execute on our foundational liquidity mission drives community and economic development.” Affordable housing Support for affordable housing has “become part of the FHLBs’ culture,” according to González. He emphasized the importance of the FHLBs’ “liquidity mission” to support various affordable-housing programs and said that during the COVID-19 pandemic, several FHLBs dedicated more than the required 10% of profits to affordable-housing programs and related assistance for communities. “We did that with our Small Business Recovery Grant Program, making grants of $10,000 directly through our members to small businesses and nonprofits to help them keep the lights on,” he said. Through the FHLB of New York’s affordable-housing programs, member institutions can apply on behalf of local sponsors who “are planning to purchase, rehabilitate, or construct affordable homes or apartments,” according to the bank. This not only helps the people in those communities, it strengthens members’ relationships with potential customers and helps the members meet requirements under the Community Reinvestment Act. Through the Urban Development Advance program, the FHLB of New York offers advances at below-market rates to help members provide financing for commercial and economic-development projects located in urban areas where more than half of residents have annual incomes below the median. All 11 FHLBs offer similar affordable-housing programs and associated assistance to members’ communities. The FHLB of San Francisco provided a $1 million grant to build a 53-unit apartment building as part of the renewal of the Potrero Hill neighborhood. Century Housing Corp. — a Community Development Financial Institution that is a member of the bank — applied for the AHP funds on behalf of BRIDGE Housing, a nonprofit affordable housing developer. And the San Francisco bank’s Workforce Initiative Subsidy for Homeownership program provides member institutions with matching grants to help first-time home buyers with down-payment and closing costs. Looking ahead The FHFA is currently conducting a review of the FHLB system. The first part of that process has involved soliciting comments from stakeholders, including the public. Videos and transcripts of those conversations are available on the FHFA website. One example of positive feedback came from Deron Burr, the president and CEO of People’s Bank of Seneca, Mo., who said on March 23 that his institution’s relationship with the FHLB of Des Moines was “instrumental” to funding a variety of community-development activities. When considering the future of the FHLB system, Ryan Donovan, CEO of the Council of FHLBanks, said it is important to remember that during the financial crisis of 2008-09, the COVID-19 pandemic and the banking-industry disruption that began in March, “the FHLB system was able to be a first responder because we already had established relationships with the community banks and credit unions.” González said that one area where the FHFA might make improvements to the system is in the “highly regulated” affordable-housing programs. “There may be room to make them more accessible,” he said. In a report defending the FHLB system, Jim Parrot of the Urban Institute and Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, provide data to show how the FHLBs have served as the U.S. financial system’s “liquidity first responder” through several crises. When other wholesale liquidity sources are disrupted and before the Federal Reserve is able to take extraordinary action during a crisis, the FHLBs “help fill the gap between these two sources of funding with access to low-cost liquidity through the cycle for institutions operating in the mortgage market,” according to Parrot and Zandi. As Goldstein noted, “There is no system like this anywhere else in the world.”",https://images.mktw.net/im-793439?width=1280&size=1,2023-06-05,-0.045,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Adam Goldstein', 'description': 'American DJ (1973-2009)', 'full_name': 'DJ AM', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/AdamGoldsteinDec08.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'York', 'latitude': 44.0513916015625, 'longitude': -79.48027801513672, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'González', 'latitude': 30.581579208374023, 'longitude': -87.2913589477539, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Puerto Rico', 'latitude': 18.248289108276367, 'longitude': -66.49989318847656, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Jersey', 'latitude': 40.16706085205078, 'longitude': -74.49987030029297, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Virgin Islands', 'latitude': 18.322750091552734, 'longitude': -64.80814361572266, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Congress', 'latitude': 40.9258918762207, 'longitude': -82.05293273925781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Recovery', 'latitude': 39.05371856689453, 'longitude': -76.13995361328125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 37.12004852294922, 'longitude': -93.48018646240234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Goldstein', 'latitude': 51.133209228515625, 'longitude': 8.194860458374023, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Moody', 'latitude': 48.83346939086914, 'longitude': -80.33303833007812, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Standard', 'latitude': 39.41510009765625, 'longitude': -79.17530822753906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Poor', 'latitude': 27.98027992248535, 'longitude': 56.74306106567383, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S. Treasury', 'latitude': 33.32728958129883, 'longitude': -107.71475982666016, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Strickland', 'latitude': -42.36180114746094, 'longitude': 146.65078735351562, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Janney', 'latitude': 40.14788818359375, 'longitude': -74.9371109008789, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Committee', 'latitude': -33.15781021118164, 'longitude': 26.832590103149414, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Support', 'latitude': 6.624919891357422, 'longitude': -58.19475173950195, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Grant', 'latitude': 43.317569732666016, 'longitude': -75.06044006347656, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Potrero Hill', 'latitude': 37.75659942626953, 'longitude': -122.39913940429688, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Seneca', 'latitude': 36.841461181640625, 'longitude': -94.6110610961914, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Council', 'latitude': 44.729888916015625, 'longitude': -116.43820190429688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Institute', 'latitude': 32.33570098876953, 'longitude': -90.63066101074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Parrot', 'latitude': 37.31917190551758, 'longitude': -84.05860900878906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Zandi', 'latitude': 9.0, 'longitude': 11.716670036315918, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not-related content.

Cortez Masto secures affordable housing funds for 2 Northern Nevada projects - Reno Gazette Journal,Cortez Masto secures affordable housing funds for 2 Northern Nevada projects  Reno Gazette Journal,"Mon, 10 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZ2ouY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNy8xMC9jb3J0ZXotbWFzdG8tc2VjdXJlcy1hZmZvcmRhYmxlLWhvdXNpbmctZnVuZHMtZm9yLTItbm9ydGhlcm4tbmV2YWRhLXByb2plY3RzLzcwMzkzNjY0MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Reno Gazette Journal,"Nevada will get $4.8 million to build more affordable housing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto announced Monday. Among the projects supported will be construction of Orovada Street Senior Apartments in Reno and affordable homes on Washoe Tribal Trust Land near Carson City in collaboration with the Washoe Housing Authority. Cortez Masto said in a statement she’s been trying to pressure the Federal Home Loan Bank for years to give the Silver State more money after discovering it hadn’t been receiving its expected share of funds intended for California, Arizona and Nevada. “The Federal Home Loan Banks have a responsibility to meet the housing and community development needs in their region, and it was clear to me that they had neglected Nevada,” she said. “I fought to make sure we got our fair share of support, and this funding I secured is the largest non-federal investment in affordable housing Nevada has had in recent memory.” In 2021, California received $37 million in funding to build affordable rental housing through the Affordable Housing Program while Nevada received nothing, Cortez Masto’s office said by email. In 2022, Nevada received only $1.9 million in the affordable housing competitive grant program. This new funding is reported to be only the second time in the past 20 years that a Nevada tribe has received an Affordable Housing Program competitive award from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The money for Nevada projects will also go to the Golden Rule Senior Apartments in Las Vegas, new affordable apartments in Pioche and construction of Rome South 2 Senior Apartments in North Las Vegas. The funding is an annual opportunity. Nevada affordable housing developers, community development nonprofits and tribes will be able to apply for next year’s Nevada Targeted Fund as well as the general Affordable Housing Program. AHP funds count as non-federal matching dollars that help developers compete for federal housing funds.","https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/07/07/PREN/1dd9a552-1d9a-4a03-a584-3e042c00dfe0-AP22317682787308.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1023,576,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200",2023-07-10,-0.164,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nevada', 'latitude': 39.25020980834961, 'longitude': -116.75119018554688, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reno', 'latitude': 39.52962875366211, 'longitude': -119.81379699707031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washoe', 'latitude': 45.1638298034668, 'longitude': -109.21321105957031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Carson City', 'latitude': 39.16379928588867, 'longitude': -119.76740264892578, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Silver State', 'latitude': 39.25020980834961, 'longitude': -116.75119018554688, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Arizona', 'latitude': 34.500301361083984, 'longitude': -111.5009765625, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Golden', 'latitude': 39.74694061279297, 'longitude': -105.21083068847656, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Las Vegas', 'latitude': 36.17496871948242, 'longitude': -115.13722229003906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pioche', 'latitude': 37.929691314697266, 'longitude': -114.45220947265625, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'North Las Vegas', 'latitude': 36.19886016845703, 'longitude': -115.11750030517578, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco has awarded Nevada $4.8 million for affordable housing projects, including senior apartments in Reno and affordable homes on Washoe Tribal Trust Land.

The WISH Program is designed to help eligible lower-income families and individuals throughout Arizona, California, and Nevada achieve the dream of homeownership. As part of this year’s initiative, the FHLBank San Francisco will partner with its member institutions to deliver 4-to-1 matching grants, up to the Federal Housing Finance Agency's annual maximum subsidy of $30,806 to aspiring homeowners. “We designed the WISH Program with one goal in mind: to extend resources and funding to thousands of families who are left without the downpayment means necessary to secure a mortgage and buy a home,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, CEO and president of FHLBank San Francisco. “The WISH Program has been an important initiative for decades and we are confident that the 2024 program will deliver real impact across our regional footprint. We invite our member financial institutions to join us in this critical campaign.” The WISH Program exemplifies FHLBank San Francisco's enduring commitment to increasing access to homeownership. Since the first grant was made to a first-time homebuyer in 2000, the program has distributed over $153 million in grants, facilitating homeownership for over 9,800 lower-income families in communities served by FHLBank San Francisco’s member financial institutions. Funding for the WISH Program is made possible by the FHLBank San Francisco's commitment to allocate up to 15% of its annual net earnings towards initiatives promoting affordable housing and community economic development. WISH matching grants are aimed at equipping working families and individuals with the resources they need to move from renting to owning and can complement or supplement many local, state, and federal homeownership programs and initiatives. The homebuyer’s contributions can include personal savings, as well as savings from Individual Development Accounts (IDA), Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program savings, gift funds, or sweat equity. Susana Zavala, a single mother who wanted to make a new start in Mesa, Arizona, was able to purchase a home for her family with the support of a $15,000 matching WISH grant supplementing the $5,000 downpayment funds she had saved. Her mortgage and receipt of a WISH grant were facilitated by FHLBank San Francisco member, TruWest Credit Union. “As a member-owned cooperative with a mission of serving our community, TruWest Credit Union is thrilled to partner with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to provide WISH grants to low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers,” says Alan Althouse, TruWest Credit Union President and CEO. “Since 2013, we have been able to help over 740 families buy their first home, providing nearly $14 million in downpayment grant assistance.” FHLBank San Francisco is now accepting applications from member institutions to participate in the WISH Program on a rolling basis through March 14, 2025.

Key Takeaways from the FcRn Inhibitor Market Report As per DelveInsight’s analysis, the FcRn inhibitor market is anticipated to grow at a significant CAGR by 2034. Leading FcRn inhibitor companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Immunovant, and others are developing novel FcRn inhibitors that can be available in the FcRn Inhibitor market in the coming years. Some of the key FcRn inhibitors include Nipocalimab, Batoclimab, and IMVT-1402, among others. In February 2024, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for nipocalimab for the treatment of alloimmunizeda pregnant individuals at high risk of severe hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). In December 2023, Immunovant announced that results from the initial cohort of patients in an ongoing 24-week Phase II clinical trial of batoclimab in patients with Graves’ disease meaningfully exceeded 50% response rates. Discover which therapies are expected to grab the FcRn inhibitor market share @ FcRn Inhibitor Market Report The FcRn inhibitor market has witnessed significant dynamics in recent years, driven by burgeoning demand for innovative treatments in autoimmune diseases and other related disorders. These inhibitors, designed to modulate the function of the FcRn, hold promise in improving the management of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and more. The FcRn inhibitor market is characterized by a robust pipeline of biologics and small molecules targeting the FcRn pathway, reflecting a growing interest from pharmaceutical companies to tap into this lucrative sector. One key factor shaping the FcRn inhibitor market dynamics is the rising prevalence of autoimmune diseases worldwide. As these conditions continue to impact millions of individuals globally, there’s an escalating need for novel therapeutics that can offer enhanced efficacy and improved patient outcomes. FcRn Inhibitors, with their potential to prevent the recycling of pathogenic IgG antibodies, represent a promising avenue for addressing the underlying mechanisms of these diseases, driving both research and investment in the field. Moreover, the competitive landscape of the FcRn inhibitor market is evolving rapidly, with companies striving to differentiate their products through various strategies. This includes focusing on next-generation inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetic profiles, exploring novel delivery mechanisms, and pursuing indications beyond the traditional autoimmune spectrum. Collaborations, partnerships, and licensing agreements are also prominent features, as players seek to leverage synergies and bolster their positions in this competitive yet burgeoning FcRn inhibitor market segment. As the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of FcRn inhibitors continue to unfold, the market dynamics are poised for further evolution, presenting both challenges and opportunities for stakeholders across the pharmaceutical landscape. FcRn Inhibitor Treatment Market VYVGART (efgartigimod) marked the first approval within the FcRn class of medications. This antibody fragment binds to FcRn, halting its recycling of IgG into the bloodstream. This action leads to an overall reduction in IgG levels, including the abnormal AChR antibodies associated with myasthenia gravis. The FDA granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug Designations to VYVGART. In December 2021, the FDA approved VYVGART, developed by Argenx, for treating gMG. Additionally, VYVGART is under assessment for various other conditions such as Post-COVID Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (PC-POTS), bullous pemphigoid, primary immune thrombocytopenia, and CIPD, among others. UCB Pharma developed RYSTIGGO (rozanolixizumab) for addressing autoimmune illnesses. It gained its initial approval in June 2023 in the US for managing gMG in adults with either anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibodies. This marked the first approval in the US for gMG with both types of antibodies. Following this, in September 2023, UCB announced that RYSTIGGO was approved by the Japanese MHLW for treating adults with generalized Myasthenia Gravis, specifically for those who do not respond adequately to steroids or other immunosuppressants. Then, in January 2024, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for RYSTIGGO as an additional treatment alongside standard therapy for gMG in adult patients with either AChR or MuSK antibodies. UCB’s pipeline also includes evaluations of RYSTIGGO for MOG antibody disease, autoimmune encephalitis, and severe fibromyalgia syndrome. As the field of FcRn inhibitors becomes increasingly competitive, it is interesting to draw comparisons between UCB’s RYSTIGGO and Argenx’s VYVGART. Both medications are advancing in comparable conditions like gMG and CIDP, highlighting the expanding possibilities and intense rivalry within this area. Learn more about the FDA-approved FcRn inhibitor @ FcRn Inhibitor Drugs Key Emerging FcRn Inhibitors and Companies Some of the drugs in the pipeline include Nipocalimab (Johnson & Johnson) Batoclimab (Immunovant), and IMVT-1402 (Immunovant), among others. Nipocalimab, developed by Johnson & Johnson, is an experimental, highly potent, fully human, lacking sugar molecules, a non-activating monoclonal antibody designed to specifically inhibit FcRn. Its goal is to decrease the levels of various immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies circulating in the body, which include both self-targeting (autoantibodies) and foreign-targeting (alloantibodies) antibodies associated with numerous conditions. Nipocalimab stands out as the sole anti-FcRn treatment being investigated in three significant areas within the realm of autoantibody-related disorders: Rare Autoantibody diseases (such as generalized myasthenia gravis in adults and children, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies); Maternal Fetal diseases caused by maternal alloantibodies (like HDFN); and Common Rheumatology disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus). In February 2024, the FDA provided Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for nipocalimab’s use in treating pregnant individuals sensitized to foreign antigens, who are at a high risk of severe hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). This designation was granted based on findings from the Phase II UNITY clinical trial focused on HDFN. Batoclimab, a completely human anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody, inhibits FcRn-IgG interactions, hastening the breakdown of autoantibodies and offering a potential treatment for IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. In December 2023, Immunovant reported that results from the first group of patients in an ongoing 24-week Phase II clinical trial of batoclimab for Graves’ disease showed response rates exceeding 50% significantly. The global Phase III clinical trials for batoclimab in myasthenia gravis (MG) and thyroid eye disease (TED) are advancing as planned, with expected top-line data to be released in the second half of 2024 for MG and the first half of 2025 for TED. In addition, Immunovant has received approval from the FDA for IMVT-1402, aiming to be a leading anti-FcRn antibody for treating IgG-mediated autoimmune conditions. In early Phase I trials with healthy adults, IMVT-1402 showed promising safety and pharmacodynamic results. These qualities, along with its easy administration method allowing potential self-treatment, position IMVT-1402 as a hopeful solution for various autoimmune disorders with unmet patient needs. The company intends to kick off 4-5 programs seeking approval for IMVT-1402 by March 31, 2025 and aims to start trials for IMVT-1402 in 10 different conditions within the following two fiscal years, including the 4-5 programs by March 31, 2026. The anticipated launch of these emerging therapies are poised to transform the FcRN inhibitors market landscape in the coming years. As these cutting-edge therapies continue to mature and gain regulatory approval, they are expected to reshape the FcRN inhibitors market landscape, offering new standards of care and unlocking opportunities for medical innovation and economic growth. To know more about FcRn inhibitor clinical trials, visit @ FcRn Inhibitor Treatment Drugs FcRn Inhibitor Overview Innovative drugs known as Neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) inhibitors have displayed significant promise in treating various autoimmune conditions, such as myasthenia gravis (MG). These inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies designed to target FcRn, possessing a strong binding affinity to FcRn under both normal and acidic conditions. When inside cells, FcRn inhibitors compete with Immunoglobulin G (IgG) for FcRn binding. Their heightened affinity prevents IgG from attaching to FcRn, causing IgG to be transported to lysosomes and broken down, ultimately lowering circulating IgG levels. The FcRn receptor consists of two subunits: FCGRT and B2M. FCGRT includes three functional regions outside the cell, comprising a single transmembrane helix, three soluble domains (α1, α2, and α3), and a cytoplasmic tail (studies suggest this tail contains 44 amino acid residues that may be involved in signaling intracellular pathways). The increased affinity of FcRn can have negative effects on autoimmune diseases driven by IgG, such as rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, or pemphigus vulgaris. By targeting FcRn and inhibiting its function, IgG breakdown is enhanced, resulting in decreased overall IgG and harmful autoantibody levels. This approach is expected to alleviate autoimmune abnormalities caused by IgG. Studies have indicated that FcRn-targeting therapies lead to faster and more specific reduction in IgG levels compared to traditional therapies like plasma exchange for myasthenia gravis. Moreover, the advantage of this treatment is highlighted by the fact that IgA, IgD, IgE, and IgM are not influenced by FcRn-mediated processes, setting it apart from numerous conventional therapies.

New details on rush of Home Loan bank borrowings at three failed banks - American Banker,New details on rush of Home Loan bank borrowings at three failed banks  American Banker,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 20:36:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ldy1kZXRhaWxzLW9uLXJ1c2gtb2YtaG9tZS1sb2FuLWJhbmstYm9ycm93aW5ncy1hdC10aHJlZS1mYWlsZWQtYmFua3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,American Banker,"Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank increased their outstanding borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank System by more than a third each shortly before failing, according to the Government Accountability Office. The increase in borrowings is the subject of a 27-page GAO report issued last week that examines the role of the Federal Home Loan banks in providing liquidity to their members during the banking crisis in the spring of 2023. The report provides a granular take on where money was going to the failed banks in the ninth inning of their existence as each sought to stem massive outflows from depositors. The GAO found that the three banks borrowed substantially more from the Home Loan Bank System than a group of their peers that included 16 commercial banks. The report is the first in a series in which the GAO will look at broader issues related to the Home Loan Bank System. The private network of 11 regional, cooperative banks was created in 1932 after the Great Depression to serve as a source of funding for thrifts originating mortgages. The report was requested by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., and the panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters of California. ""GAO found the FHLBs of New York and San Francisco provided significant levels of advances to these banks compared to others, and that Signature Bank used FHLB advances to offset liquidity gaps it experienced related to crypto-related deposits,"" Waters said last week in a press release. ""Meanwhile, SVB was unable to reposition collateral quickly enough from its FHLB to the Fed's discount window to access emergency liquidity."" Starting on March 1, 2023, SVB increased its borrowings by 50% to $30 billion and then failed a week later. Signature's borrowings rose 37% to $11.2 billion in the first two weeks of March before it failed that same month. And First Republic's borrowings jumped 45% to $28.1 billion in the first two weeks of March before it failed in May, the GAO report found. The GAO looked at the communication and coordination of the Home Loan banks with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Reserve System — the failed banks' primary federal regulators — and the repayment of the failed banks' outstanding loans, known as advances, to the system. ""One of the main areas of focus is: Are the Federal Home Loan banks managing their relationships and their counterparty risk with institutions as they begin to fail, and do they have the right agreements and oversight in place with the Fed and others?"" said Jim Parrott, co-owner of Parrott Ryan Advisors and a nonresident fellow at the Urban Institute. ""When everything's going 90 miles an hour, as an institution begins to take on water, are all of the relevant regulators and others who are in some sense indirectly responsible for taxpayer risks … coordinating?"" The GAO said that SVB failed before the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco was able to request additional supervisory information from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The New York and San Francisco Home Loan banks both were able to communicate with the FDIC about Signature and First Republic as those banks were declining, the GAO said. ""It was striking to me that [the Home Loan banks] kept lending to these failing banks until the very last week or days before they failed,"" said Sharon Cornelissen, director of housing at the Consumer Federation of America and chair of the Coalition for FHLB Reform. ""Only because the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco does not lend over the weekend, SVB was frantically trying to gain access to the [Fed's] discount window at the very last moment."" The report was released several months after the Federal Housing Finance Agency's review of the system. FHFA, the system's regulator, released a 100-year review of the Home Loan banks in November that included 50 recommendations for reforms. Waters said she is working on legislation to implement many of the FHFA's recommendations, including doubling the system's contributions to affordable housing to 20% from the current congressionally-mandated 10%. She also is exploring ways to improve access and functioning of the Fed's discount window. Teresa Bazemore, president and CEO of the San Francisco Home Loan Bank, said in an interview last week that it is important to understand what was happening ahead of the March 2023 liquidity crisis. Banks and credit unions were flush with record levels of deposits in 2021 from government stimulus programs in response to the pandemic. At that time, the Home Loan banks' core business of providing liquidity to members had dried up. But in 2022, money market mutual funds started offering depositors higher rates, putting many banks in a squeeze. ""Some of the money started to outflow from [member] banks at the same time those institutions had already invested some of that money. They'd already loaned it out, they'd already made mortgage loans [and] put them in their portfolios. They bought securities,"" Bazemore said. ""So if you compare where things were at the end of 2021 to the end of 2022, you saw our advances go up as a system because of that transfer of deposits out of the banks and credit unions. And that's really what the system was set up for."" The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates 11 times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to curb inflation. As a result, many banks were ""upside down"" and needed to borrow from the Home Loan Bank System, or alternatively, had to bring in brokered deposits, Bazemore said. Brokered deposits are typically made by companies with the assistance of a third party. ""If you've got a portfolio of 3% mortgage loans, where are you going to get the income to pay 4% or 5%, to compete with the money market [funds]?"" Bazemore asked. The GAO report also looked at the repayment of advances by the failed banks and whether there was a cost to the federal Deposit Insurance Fund. After regulators took aggressive steps last year to protect uninsured depositors, particularly venture capitalists after the failure of SVB, the FDIC assessed a special fee on more than 100 banks to replenish the fund, known in bank parlance as the ""DIF."" The GAO report said that repayment ""does not impose a direct cost'' but that ""research findings vary"" regarding the risks that failed banks' advances from the system pose to the DIF. Home Loan banks have a priority position ahead of the FDIC when a bank goes into receivership, an issue that has become a bone of contention among critics of the system. The GAO said that in 2000 and 2005, respectively, studies by the Fed and FDIC noted that ""FHLBanks' priority position in receivership could subsidize member bank risk-taking, which could imply greater losses for the Deposit Insurance Fund."" The GAO also said that a 2023 FHFA review of academic literature found that Home Loan banks' regulatory policies and practices mitigate moral-hazard concerns, while a study by the Urban Institute last year found that an increase in a commercial bank's use of advances reduces the odds of failure, particularly for a smaller bank. Still, the report noted that ""if proceeds of the failed bank's liquidated assets do not cover claims eligible for the fund after repayment of FHLBank advances and any other secured claims, the Deposit Insurance Fund would incur costs.'' The GAO report also detailed the fees charged by both the San Francisco and New York Home Loan banks, which varied dramatically. Bank failures may trigger prepayment fees that the Home Loan banks charge, which are required by the FHFA for certain products. Waiver fees also may be charged if a member-bank makes voluntary prepayments. The Home Loan banks also may waive the fees, or even charge the FDIC, as the receiver of a failed bank, a waiver fee to compensate for risks. Prepayment penalties also vary depending on the length and terms of an advance. The FDIC typically pays off advances and incurs a fee in order to take the collateral that has been pledged by a commercial bank to a Home Loan bank. After SVB failed, the FDIC transferred all its deposits and nearly all of its assets to Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, which repaid the $30 billion in outstanding advances to the San Francisco Home Loan Bank. The San Francisco bank received $266.5 million in prepayment fees and $18.8 million in waiver fees. Most of SVB's advances had terms of one to three years. ""SVB did not have a particular stated strategy for borrowing advances in that maturity range,"" the GAO said, citing officials from the San Francisco Home Loan Bank. Meanwhile First Republic's outstanding advances were assumed by JPMorgan Chase, which repaid roughly $5.8 billion in loans that had reached maturity, and has indicated that it plans to repay the remaining advances according to the advance terms. In contrast, after Signature Bank failed, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York also received full repayment for Signature's $11.2 billion in outstanding advances but received just $260,000 in prepayment fees and no waiver fees. ""The broader discussion is whether this is the role that we want [the FHLBs] to play,"" Cornelissen said. ""According to the law they were within their rights to provide liquidity, but we should be more tightly regulating them because it's not their place to be the lender of last resort. They are going to keep lending until the very last day because that's their business model and presents no risk to them."" Ryan Donovan, president and CEO of the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, the system's trade group, applauded the GAO report for finding that the system made efforts to coordinate with the Federal Reserve banks of New York and San Francisco in accordance with policies and procedures. ""We appreciate the findings in the GAO's report, and we believe they validate what we have been saying for a year: that the FHLBanks acted as a critical shock absorber for the financial system during a period of unprecedented turbulence in the spring of 2023,"" Donovan said. ""The two most important takeaways from this report are that the FHLBanks provided crucial liquidity to their members in direct accordance with the structure and role laid out for them by Congress, and that the FHLBanks worked tirelessly in a coordinated fashion with primary financial regulators to ensure the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system."" The Federal Home Loan Bank System reported earnings of $6.7 billion at year-end, an 111% jump from a year earlier. The system also paid out a record $3.4 billion in dividends to its members, more than double the $1.4 billion paid in 2022. The GAO report is dated March 8 but was released on April 8 after lawmakers and the Home Loan banks had a month to assess its findings.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/20/2d/d39f5c04427a8cec17146f1e677a/linkedin-post-2023-06-22t153459-704.jpg,2024-04-16,-0.024,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'GAO', 'latitude': 14.376899719238281, 'longitude': 9.014699935913086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'House', 'latitude': 34.646728515625, 'longitude': -103.90441131591797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Committee', 'latitude': -33.15781021118164, 'longitude': 26.832590103149414, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'N.C.', 'latitude': 35.50069046020508, 'longitude': -80.00032043457031, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Democrat', 'latitude': 43.09627151489258, 'longitude': -116.77539825439453, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'York', 'latitude': 44.0513916015625, 'longitude': -79.48027801513672, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Institute', 'latitude': 44.89332962036133, 'longitude': -87.28704071044922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Federation', 'latitude': -28.83146095275879, 'longitude': 121.7739028930664, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bazemore', 'latitude': 33.89455032348633, 'longitude': -87.70001983642578, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DIF', 'latitude': 0.9915599822998047, 'longitude': 40.9551887512207, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Valley', 'latitude': 46.066810607910156, 'longitude': -62.7819709777832, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Council', 'latitude': 44.729888916015625, 'longitude': -116.43820190429688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Donovan', 'latitude': 40.883331298828125, 'longitude': -87.6161117553711, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Congress', 'latitude': 40.9258918762207, 'longitude': -82.05293273925781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]","The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco provided significant advances to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) before its failure, with SVB increasing its borrowings by 50% to $30 billion in the week leading up to its collapse.

Diluted earnings per share was $1.05 during the three months ended March 31, 2024, down from $1.28 per share during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Return on average assets was 1.55% during the current quarter, down from 1.93% during the first quarter of 2023. Return on average equity was 16.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, down from 25.0% during the first quarter of 2023. The 2023 quarter included a one-time gain of $1.7 million on termination of interest rate swaps. Excluding this gain, non-GAAP income for the first quarter of 2023 would have been $6.4 million, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $1.08 and return on average assets of 1.63%. Financial Highlights March 31, 2024 compared to March 31, 2023 Gross loans increased by $60 million, or 7%, to $976 million.Total assets increased by $62 million, or 4% to $1.6 billion.Total equity increased by $32.7 million, or 25% to $161 million.Book value per share increased by $5.41, or 25% to $27.39. President’s CommentsAndrew J. Ryback, director, president, and chief executive officer of Plumas Bancorp and Plumas Bank, commented on the first quarter of 2024, stating, “We are excited to announce the successful completion of the branch sale-leaseback transaction with MountainSeed Real Estate Services (MountainSeed), valued at approximately $25.7 million. This transaction underscores our commitment to optimizing our capital structure while reaffirming our dedication to serving our communities for the long term. The gains generated from this transaction were instrumental in offsetting losses in our investment portfolio, enhancing our earnings profile and increasing our book value per share. Quarter-over-quarter results reflect the termination of interest rate swaps resulting in a one-time gain in the first quarter of 2023. Non-performing loans are well-collateralized, and we expect resolution on significant amounts in the coming quarter. As the Federal Reserve announced its intention to implement up to three rate cuts this year, we remain vigilant and adaptable in navigating potential challenges and opportunities in the market. Plumas Bank is well-positioned to leverage its strong capital position and diversified portfolios to sustain growth and maximize returns for our stakeholders.” Sales/Leaseback and Investment Restructuring On January 19, 2024, Plumas Bank entered into two agreements for the purchase and sale of real property (the “Sale Agreements”). One Sale Agreement provided for the sale to MountainSeed of nine properties owned and operated by the Plumas Bank as branches (the “Branches”) for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $25.7 million. The branch portion of the sale was completed on February 14, 2024 resulting in a net gain on sale of $19.9 million. The second Sale Agreement provides for the sale to MountainSeed of up to three properties operated as non-branch administrative offices (the “Non-Branch Offices”) for an aggregate cash purchase price of $7.9 million, assuming all of the Non-Branch Offices are sold. The closing date on the Non-Branch Offices has been extended to September 16, 2024. Under the Sale Agreements, the parties have agreed, concurrently with the closing of the sale of the Properties, to enter into triple net lease agreements (the “Lease Agreements”) pursuant to which Plumas Bank will lease each of the Properties sold. Each Lease Agreement will have an initial term of fifteen years with one 15-year renewal option. The Lease Agreements will provide for an annual rent of approximately $3.1 million in the aggregate for all Properties of which $2.4 million relates to the completed branch sale, increased by two percent (2%) per annum for each year during the initial fifteen year term. During the renewal term, the initial rent will be the basic rent during the last year of the initial term, increased by two percent (2%) per annum for each year during the renewal term. The gain on sales of the branches was offset by losses on the sale of approximately $115 million in investment securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we sold $115 million in investment securities having a weighted average tax equivalent yield of 2.24%, recording a $19.8 million loss on the sales. Beginning in December 2023 and ending on March 27, 2024 we purchased $120 million in investments securities having a weighted average tax equivalent yield of 5.25%. Loans, Deposits, Investments and Cash Gross loans increased by $60 million, or 7%, from $916 million at March 31, 2023, to $976 million at March 31, 2024. Increases in loans included $41 million in commercial real estate loans, $22 million in construction loans, $5 million in commercial loans, $5 million in agricultural loans and $1 million in equity lines of credit; these items were partially offset by a decrease of $11 million in automobile loans and $3 million in residential real estate loans. On March 31, 2024, approximately 76% of the Company’s loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans. The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company’s lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes. The frequency at which variable rate loans reprice can vary from one day to several years. Most of our commercial real estate portfolio reprices every five years. Loans indexed to the prime interest rate were approximately 19% of the Company’s loan portfolio; these loans reprice within one day to three months of a change in the prime rate. Total deposits decreased by $107 million to $1.3 billion at March 31, 2024. The decrease in deposits includes decreases of $76 million in demand deposits, $7 million in money market accounts, and $66 million in savings deposits. Time deposits increased by $42 million. We attribute much of the decrease to the current interest rate environment as we have seen some deposits leave for higher rates and some customers reluctant to borrow to fund operating expenses and instead have drawn down their excess deposit balances. Beginning in April 2023, we began offering a time deposit promotion offering 7-month and 11-month time deposits at an interest rate of 4%. Effective June 30, 2023, we discontinued this promotion which generated $46 million in deposits. However, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023 we allowed those customers who had promotional time deposits to renew those deposits at similar terms. At March 31, 2024, 51% of the Company’s deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits. Total investment securities decreased by $37 million from $484 million at March 31, 2023, to $447 million at March 31, 2024. The Bank’s investment security portfolio consists of debt securities issued by US Government agencies, US Government sponsored agencies and municipalities. Cash and due from banks increased by $22 million from $106 million at March 31, 2023, to $128 million at March 31, 2024. Asset Quality Nonperforming assets (which are comprised of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned (“OREO”) and repossessed vehicle holdings) at March 31, 2024 were $6.0 million, up from $4.2 million at March 31, 2023. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased to 0.37% at March 31, 2024 up from 0.26% at March 31, 2023. OREO increased by $274,000 from $83,000 at March 31, 2023 to $357,000 at March 31, 2024. Nonperforming loans were $5.6 million at March 31, 2024 and $4.0 million at March 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 0.57% at March 31, 2024, up from 0.43% at March 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024 we recorded a provision for credit losses of $821,000 consisting of a provision for credit losses on loans of $900,000 and a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $79,000. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $1,525,000 consisting of a provision for credit losses on loans of $1,250,000 and an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $275,000 during the first quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs, mostly related to our automobile loan portfolio, totaled $610,000 and $166,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses totaled $13.2 million at March 31, 2024 and $12.3 million at March 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.35% at March 31, 2024 and 2023. The following tables present the activity in the allowance for credit losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands). Bank Term Funding Program The Federal Reserve Board, on March 12, 2023, announced the creation of a new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The BTFP offers loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. These assets will be valued at par. At December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the BTFP totaling $80 million. In January 2024 the Company borrowed an additional $25 million under the BTFP for a total of $105 million outstanding at March 31, 2024. This borrowing earns interest at the rate of 4.85% and is payable on January 17, 2025. Borrowings under the BTFP can be prepaid without penalty. Interest expense recognized on the BTFP borrowings for the three months ended March 31, 2024, totaled $1.2 million. Shareholders’ Equity Total shareholders’ equity increased by $32.7 million from $128.8 million at March 31, 2023, to $161.5 million at March 31, 2024. The $32.7 million includes earnings during the twelve-month period totaling $28.4 million, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $9.4 million related to the investment portfolio restructuring described earlier and stock option activity totaling $0.9 million. These items were partially offset by the payment of cash dividends totaling $6.0 million. Liquidity The Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers’ borrowing needs and satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings. The Company’s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both. On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by offering competitive rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit. The Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB) and can borrow up to $237 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $431 million. The Company is also eligible to participate in the Bank Term Lending Program. At March 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the BTFP totaling $105 million, secured by $117 million in par value of securities pledged as collateral under the BTFP. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line and the BTFP, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with two of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $50 million and $20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings to the FHLB, or the correspondent banks at March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023. Customer deposits are the Company’s primary source of funds. Total deposits decreased by $107 million to $1.3 billion at March 31, 2024 from $1.4 billion at March 31, 2023. Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities. The Company estimates that it has approximately $400 million in uninsured deposits. Of this amount, $94 million represents deposits that are collateralized such as deposits of states, municipalities and tribal accounts. The Company’s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand. During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Fransisco, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth. Management believes that the Company’s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future. Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Driven by an increase in market rates and growth in the loan portfolio, net interest income increased by $308,000 from $17.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, to $17.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in net interest income includes an increase of $2.2 million in interest income partially offset by an increase of $1.9 million in interest expense. Interest and fees on loans increased by $1.9 million related both to an increase in average balance and an increase in yield. Average loan balances increased by $49 million, while the average yield on loans increased by 46 basis points from 5.63% during the first quarter of 2023 to 6.09% during the current quarter. The average prime interest rate increased from 7.69% during the first quarter of 2023 to 8.5% during the current quarter. Approximately 19% of the Company’s loans are tied to the prime interest rate and most of these reprice within one to three months with a change in prime. Interest on investment securities increased by $668,000 related to an increase in average investment securities of $13.4 million to $480 million and an increase in yield of 44 basis points to 3.68%. The increase in loan and investment yields is consistent with the increase in market rates during 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024 and the restructuring of the investment portfolio discussed earlier. Interest on cash balances decreased by $327,000 related to a decline in average balance of $44.2 million. This was partially offset by an increase in the rate paid on these balances which increased from 4.64% during the first quarter of 2023 to 5.57% during the current quarter mostly related to an increase in the rate paid on balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). The average rate earned on FRB balances increased from 4.59% during the first quarter of 2023 to 5.40% during the current quarter. Interest expense increased from $638,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to $2.6 million during the current period related to an increase in rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and an increase in borrowings. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from 0.36% during the 2023 quarter to 1.33% in 2024 related mainly to an increase in market interest rates, an increase in borrowings and the effect of a 4% time deposit promotion. Interest paid on deposits increased by $720,000 and is broken down by product type as follows: money market accounts – $159,000 and time deposits – $580,000. Related to a decline of average balance of $67 million, interest on savings deposits declined by $19,000. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.28% during the first quarter of 2023 to 0.75% during the current quarter. During March 2023 we redeemed our junior subordinated debentures with funding provided by a $10 million borrowing on Plumas Bancorp’s line of credit/term loan facility. Interest expense incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2023, on the junior subordinated debentures totaled $141,000. During the fourth quarter of 2023 we borrowed $80 million under the BTFP and during the January 2024 we increased this borrowing by $25 million to a total of $105,000. Additionally, we increased Plumas Bancorp’s borrowing on its line of credit to $15 million during the current quarter. Interest incurred on these borrowings totaled $1.4 million and $13,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased 2bp to 4.62%, down from 4.64% for the same period in 2023. Non-Interest Income/Expense During the three months ended March 31, 2024, non-interest income totaled $2.1 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from the three months ended March 31, 2023. The largest component of this decrease was a $1.7 million gain on termination of our interest rate swaps during the 2023 quarter. On May 26, 2020 we entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $10 million, effectively converting $10 million in Subordinated Debentures related to Trust Preferred Securities to fixed rate obligations. During the first quarter of 2023 we terminated these swaps, redeemed the Trust Preferred Securities and paid all principal and interest due under the debentures. As discussed earlier, during the current period, a $19.9 million gain on sale of buildings was offset by a $19.8 million loss on investment securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, total non-interest expense increased by $1.2 million from $9.2 million during the first quarter of 2023 to $10.4 million during the current quarter. The largest components of this increase were increases in occupancy and equipment costs of $350,000, salary and benefit expense of $299,000 and an increase in other expense of $261,000. The increase in salary and benefit expense primarily includes a 5% increase in salary expense and an increase in commissions of $107 thousand that relates to an increase in SBA 7(a) loan production. Deferral of loan origination costs increased by $138,000 also related to the increase in SBA 7(a) loan production. The increase in occupancy and equipment costs relates to an increase in rental expense related to the sales/leaseback. The increase in other expense mostly relates to nonrecurring expenses.

The WISH Program is designed to help eligible lower-income families and individuals throughout Arizona, California, and Nevada achieve the dream of homeownership. As part of this year’s initiative, the FHLBank San Francisco will partner with its member institutions to deliver 4-to-1 matching grants, up to the Federal Housing Finance Agency's annual maximum subsidy of $30,806 to aspiring homeowners. “We designed the WISH Program with one goal in mind: to extend resources and funding to thousands of families who are left without the downpayment means necessary to secure a mortgage and buy a home,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, CEO and president of FHLBank San Francisco. “The WISH Program has been an important initiative for decades and we are confident that the 2024 program will deliver real impact across our regional footprint. We invite our member financial institutions to join us in this critical campaign.” The WISH Program exemplifies FHLBank San Francisco's enduring commitment to increasing access to homeownership. Since the first grant was made to a first-time homebuyer in 2000, the program has distributed over $153 million in grants, facilitating homeownership for over 9,800 lower-income families in communities served by FHLBank San Francisco’s member financial institutions. Funding for the WISH Program is made possible by the FHLBank San Francisco's commitment to allocate up to 15% of its annual net earnings towards initiatives promoting affordable housing and community economic development. WISH matching grants are aimed at equipping working families and individuals with the resources they need to move from renting to owning and can complement or supplement many local, state, and federal homeownership programs and initiatives. The homebuyer’s contributions can include personal savings, as well as savings from Individual Development Accounts (IDA), Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program savings, gift funds, or sweat equity. Susana Zavala, a single mother who wanted to make a new start in Mesa, Arizona, was able to purchase a home for her family with the support of a $15,000 matching WISH grant supplementing the $5,000 downpayment funds she had saved. Her mortgage and receipt of a WISH grant were facilitated by FHLBank San Francisco member, TruWest Credit Union. “As a member-owned cooperative with a mission of serving our community, TruWest Credit Union is thrilled to partner with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to provide WISH grants to low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers,” says Alan Althouse, TruWest Credit Union President and CEO. “Since 2013, we have been able to help over 740 families buy their first home, providing nearly $14 million in downpayment grant assistance.” FHLBank San Francisco is now accepting applications from member institutions to participate in the WISH Program on a rolling basis through March 14, 2025. First-time homebuyers interested in learning more about WISH matching grants are encouraged to contact a participating member institution directly.

Download: House passes Ukraine aid that has divided Republicans Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) said the structure of the Ukraine aid was appealing to him --- but ultimately voted against it. Gabby Birenbaum D.C. Download SHARE Good morning, and welcome to The Indy D.C. Download newsletter, a weekly look at what's going on in the nation's capital as it relates to Nevada. If a colleague or associate emailed this newsletter to you, please click here to sign up and receive your own copy of Indy D.C. Download in your inbox. At this point I’ve done several newsletters on the topic of Ukraine aid — its passage in the Senate, eroding Republican support and a constant will-they-or-won’t-they about whether Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will bring foreign aid to the floor. Given the bleak outlook of the war and the fact that Ukraine aid has always had majority support, it appears that Congress has reached a time for choosing. The House voted Saturday on the provisions of a national security supplemental funding package and decided to fund security assistance to Ukraine, amidst the backdrop of an increasingly isolationist Republican Party. And tell me if you’ve heard this one before: the speaker’s job might hang in the balance. The News of the Week: Ukraine aid We’ve finally hit the finale on the long-simmering tensions over funding security assistance to Ukraine. Johnson brought to the floor for a vote three foreign aid bills — which all passed — and then a “sidecar” bill of national security measures, which passed, and another of Republican priorities, which failed. Johnson has been lobbied intensely by the Biden administration on the issue, and after months of refusing to put Ukraine aid on the floor, cast his decision in personal terms. ""To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,” he said. “My son is going to begin in the Naval Academy this fall. This is a live fire exercise for me as it is for so many American families."" Congress last successfully appropriated aid to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Unlike the Senate’s security supplemental, which passed in February with the support of both Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV), the House voted on each of the components separately. But the substance is largely the same as the Senate package that House Republicans — including Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) — dismissed for lacking provisions addressing the U.S.-Mexico border. A foreign aid bill paired with border provisions was previously rejected by most Senate Republicans. The House bills contain: $68 billion for Ukraine, $10 billion of which is a loan that the president can forgive starting in 2026 $26.4 billion in aid to Israel and Palestine, including $9 billion for humanitarian aid — a requirement for Democrats, who want to see more food and supplies get into Gaza $8 billion for Taiwan, to counter potential Chinese aggression in the region Essentially breaking the Senate bill into pieces with slight tweaks, Johnson’s plan acknowledges that each foreign aid component has majority support in the House — although not majority support from his party, in the case of Ukraine. And because he needed Democratic votes to pass the bill, Democrats got what they wanted, including humanitarian aid. It all comes as U.S. intelligence reports indicate that Ukraine is on the verge of losing the war by the end of the year without access to the military assistance that the U.S. had provided in the past. The plan is that after the House votes Saturday, the bills will be repackaged and sent to the Senate as one piece of legislation. The bills passed, between the support of more moderate or hawkish Republicans and Democrats who have been clamoring for Ukraine aid. The Nevada Angle Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), the delegation’s lone Republican, maintained support for Ukraine aid until September, when he voted against two amendments to spending bills that would have provided security assistance, saying his district was “hot” on the issue. In February, he stood with Johnson in saying that he was unsupportive of the Senate supplemental over a lack of border provisions. But by Wednesday, he seemed poised to support the aid provisions, saying the loan structure gave him confidence and that he worried that if the U.S. does not send money to Ukraine now, they might have to send American troops down the line. Ukraine neighbors several countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, whose members, including the U.S., are compelled to come to one another’s defense in the event of an attack from a nation such as Russia. “As a general proposition, if you let Ukraine [go] overboard, [saying], ‘You're on your own. There's no more aid coming,’” Amodei said, “then, that's an awful message to send.” But ultimately, Amodei voted against the Ukraine security supplemental bill with 111 other Republicans. He voted for the Israel and Taiwan bills, and voted in support of packaging the bills together once they all had passed. He said he also supported Johnson’s strategy of splitting the security supplemental into several parts, so that members are free to vote their conscience on each aspect. Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), speaking for most Democrats, called the situation “a cluster” in a Wednesday interview. “It’s the exact same thing [as the Senate bill],” Horsford said, summing up the politics of the situation succinctly. “What's he [Johnson] doing this for? Who’s he trying to appease? He’s pissing off his caucus even more.” Indeed, the House Freedom Caucus, the hardline group of Republicans who were a habitual thorn in former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s (R-CA) side, is apoplectic over Johnson’s decision to bring Ukraine aid to the floor. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has threatened Johnson’s speakership over it. But despite the political drama and Horsford’s annoyance that Johnson chose not to bring up the Senate bill whole cloth, the Nevada Democrat said he was inclined to support the bills. Ultimately, all three of Nevada’s Democratic representatives voted in support of each of the aid bills. In an interview with Sky News, Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) threw barbs at Johnson over his prior refusal to bring Ukraine assistance up, but she seemed confident that the bills would pass. “I would say to Ukraine, thank you for being so brave and holding on,” Titus said. “Reinforcements are on the way.” The Impact The passage of the foreign aid will have both domestic and international political consequences. While the Nevada delegation may be united behind seeing the value in funding Ukraine, the ire on the right over Johnson’s choice could prove to be fatal to his political career — but that’s a problem for next week. Meanwhile, with national security priorities through the House, and likely through the Senate and to the president shortly, Congress is now freed up to focus on other obligations — potentially including some of the bipartisan priorities of Nevada’s senators. Around the Capitol 🔥”It’s Nevada, sir”— Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) mixed it up with Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on Tuesday in a hearing where she questioned him over the U.S. Postal Service’s decision to relocate its mail processing operations from Reno to Sacramento. The full video is worth watching — Rosen grills DeJoy on weather restrictions in the Donner Pass, among other fiery interactions — especially for her clear ire at his mispronunciation of Nevada. 🌲Lands rule finalized — The Bureau of Land Management finalized a rule that puts conservation on equal footing with other land uses — such as ranching and mining — on public lands, a proposition that was cheered by environmental groups and met with concern from ranchers and cattlemen. I wrote about the rule when it was first proposed here and my colleague Amy Alonzo covered some of the response here. 🏠WISHing for your dream home? — The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco — the regional bank federally mandated to set aside money for affordable housing — announced a $13 million matching grant program for prospective homeowners in Arizona, California and Nevada. Lower-income individuals can apply to the WISH program to receive a 4-to-1 matching grant up to $30,806 in down payment assistance.

This particular bill restricts the president from waiving secondary sanctions on Iranian financial assets until he gives Congress the opportunity to review the transaction. Fifty-nine Democrats joined almost every Republican to vote for the bill.

Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Announces First Quarter 2024 Operating Results - GlobeNewswire,Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Announces First Quarter 2024 Operating Results  GlobeNewswire,"Thu, 25 Apr 2024 22:18:37 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyNC8wNC8yNS8yODcwMTY2LzAvZW4vRmVkZXJhbC1Ib21lLUxvYW4tQmFuay1vZi1TYW4tRnJhbmNpc2NvLUFubm91bmNlcy1GaXJzdC1RdWFydGVyLTIwMjQtT3BlcmF0aW5nLVJlc3VsdHMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,GlobeNewswire,"SAN FRANCISCO, April 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (Bank) today announced its unaudited first quarter 2024 operating results. Net income for the first quarter of 2024 was $124 million, a decrease of $71 million compared with net income of $195 million for the first quarter of 2023. Net income for the first quarter of 2023 included $43 million of net income resulting from higher advance prepayments relative to the first quarter of 2024, which is not expected to occur at similar levels in the future, net of third-party payments to unwind interest rate swaps at fair value. “The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco continues to be a critical engine of economic vitality across our three-state region,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, president and chief executive officer. “In the first quarter of 2024, we remained an important provider of on-demand, low-cost liquidity to our member institutions, supporting community lending and economic health. Investing in a range of mandatory and voluntary affordable housing programs remains core to our mission and we are currently working with our members to engage in impactful affordable housing and economic development initiatives for the competitive 2024 grant cycle.” The $71 million decrease in net income relative to the prior-year period was primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income of $137 million, partially offset by an improvement in other income/(loss) of $62 million. The $137 million decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to $93 million in net advance prepayment fees in the prior-year period, which were significantly lower in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in net interest income compared to the prior-year period was also attributable to lower average balances of interest-earning assets and higher costs of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets and lower average balances of interest-bearing liabilities.The $62 million improvement in other income/(loss) was primarily driven by $45 million in net realized losses recognized in the prior-year period from derivatives economically hedging prepaid advances, along with $30 million of income recognized in the first quarter of 2024 in connection with the termination of a long-term funding arrangement entered into with a member borrower in 2017. At March 31, 2024, total assets were $88.0 billion, a decrease of $4.8 billion from $92.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Advances decreased by $4.4 billion to $56.9 billion at March 31, 2024, from $61.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Investments at March 31, 2024, were $29.9 billion, a net decrease of $398 million from $30.3 billion at December 31, 2023, attributable to decreases of $293 million in short-term investments and $105 million in mortgage-backed securities. Consistent with the Bank's community programs, the Bank allocated $63.4 million, or 10% of the Bank’s 2023 earnings, to its 2024 Affordable Housing Program (AHP), an annual statutory grant program that supports the creation, preservation, or purchase of affordable housing. This program includes the AHP General Fund which awards grants to projects located in the Bank’s three-state district such as the new AHP Nevada Targeted Fund that is in its second year and will award grants to qualified projects in Nevada, and the Workforce Initiative Subsidy for Homeownership (WISH) Program of which $13 million has been set aside. The WISH Program enables the Bank's members to deliver $4-to-$1 matching grants up to $30,806 to eligible low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers for downpayments and closing costs to help them purchase a home. As part of the Bank's ongoing commitment to contribute up to 15% in total of annual income to affordable housing and community economic development programs and initiatives that strengthen the communities the Bank serves in partnership with its members, the Bank has voluntarily allocated 5% of its 2023 earnings, which amounts to $32 million to affordable housing and economic development programs, in addition to its annual AHP contribution. As a part of this commitment, the Bank’s board has approved a renewal of the successful Middle-Income Downpayment Assistance program that was piloted in 2023 with $10 million in grant funding and designed to help aspiring homebuyers who make up the “missing middle” in the Bank’s high-cost district become homeowners. Because of the enthusiastic response of the Bank’s members to this voluntary program, the board has doubled its funding for this program in 2024 to $20 million as allocated from the Bank’s 2023 earnings, to provide grants of up to $50,000 to each eligible homebuyer in their pipeline. Also, the board has approved a voluntary contribution of $4 million to the Access to Housing and Economic Assistance for Development grant program, which is entering its 20th year of boosting innovative initiatives aimed at advancing economic development opportunities in underserved communities. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The Bank exceeded its 4.0% regulatory requirement with a regulatory capital ratio of 8.4% at March 31, 2024. The increase in the regulatory capital ratio from 8.0% at December 31, 2023, mainly resulted from the decrease in total assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Bank also exceeded its risk-based capital requirement of $1.1 billion with $7.4 billion in permanent capital. Total retained earnings increased to $4.4 billion at March 31, 2024, from $4.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Today, the Bank’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the average capital stock outstanding during the first quarter of 2024 at an annualized rate of 8.75%. The quarterly dividend rate is consistent with the Bank's dividend philosophy of endeavoring to pay a quarterly dividend rate that is equal to or greater than the current market rate for highly rated investments and that is sustainable under current and projected earnings while maintaining appropriate levels of capital. The quarterly dividend will total $66 million, and the Bank expects to pay the dividend on May 9, 2024. Financial Highlights(Unaudited)(Dollars in millions) Investments consist of federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits, trading securities, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities, and securities purchased under agreements to resell.The regulatory capital ratio is calculated as regulatory capital divided by total assets. Regulatory capital includes retained earnings, Class B capital stock, and mandatorily redeemable capital stock (which is classified as a liability) but excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Total regulatory capital as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $7.4 billion.Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income (annualized) divided by average interest-earning assets.Cash dividends are declared, recorded, and paid during the period, on the average capital stock outstanding during the previous quarter.

Horsford at Grand Opening of Hafen Village AHP, Mesquite, NV MESQUITE, Nev., April 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Rep. Horsford (NV-04) and the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLBank San Francisco) proudly celebrated the grand opening of the Hafen Village Apartments in northeast Nevada. Advancing initiatives that uplift marginalized communities throughout Nevada is central to Congressman Horsford’s work, a commitment he reinforces in his role as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. The new housing development, located at 850 W. Hafen Lane in Mesquite, Nevada, is providing 96 new affordable residences that lower-income individuals and families can call home. “The grand opening of Hafen Village Apartments shows what we can achieve through strong partnerships among local government, community groups, and innovative housing developers,” said Congressman Horsford. “These new affordable homes represent more than infrastructure; they are the cornerstone of stability and prosperity for vulnerable Nevada families. As we celebrate this step forward, I’m reaffirming my commitment to making projects like Hafen Village the norm and ensuring all Nevadans have access to dignified and affordable housing.” In 2022, FHLBank San Francisco awarded a $900,000 Affordable Housing Program (AHP) grant to support the Hafen Village project, amplifying the Bank and its members’ other ongoing community development efforts in rural Nevada. Grant funding was awarded through a partnership with FHLBank San Francisco’s member institution, Pacific Premier Bank, and Nevada Rural Housing Authority, the mission-driven housing finance agency that developed Hafen Village Apartments. “We are delighted to celebrate the successful grand opening of Hafen Village, a project that exemplifies our shared commitment to community development and supporting the often-overlooked rural population living and working in Nevada,” said Teresa Bryce Bazemore, president and CEO of FHLBank San Francisco. “This project is a prime example of the positive impact that can come to a community through years of hard work and thoughtful dedication. We are grateful to Congressman Horsford, Nevada Rural Housing Authority, Pacific Premier Bank, and all involved in making this project come to fruition.” According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the state of Nevada has the highest number —86%— of severely cost-burdened households in the U.S. Recognizing the urgency of this statewide issue, FHLBank San Francisco launched the Nevada Targeted Fund in 2023 to deliver more affordable housing funding directly to Nevada nonprofit housing developers. In the inaugural year of its AHP Nevada Targeted Fund, FHLBank San Francisco awarded $4.8 million to Nevada-based affordable housing groups to create or rehabilitate more than 260 affordable housing units. In addition to the Nevada Targeted Fund, FHLBank San Francisco has allocated $850,000 to help the Nevada Housing Coalition build capacity for affordable housing development through enhanced training and technical assistance programs aimed at expanding housing options for Nevadans. “We are grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with Nevada Rural Housing Authority (NRHA) on the project Hafen Village. Nevada Rural Housing Authority’s dedication to creating and maintaining affordable housing is a testament to the power of community-driven change,” said Sherri Scott, senior executive vice president, chief ESG & Corporate Social Responsibility officer at Pacific Premier Bank. “Partnerships with FHLBank San Francisco and Nevada Rural Housing Authority are integral to our Bank’s commitment to addressing daily challenges within our communities.” Hafen Village, managed by Blue Bird Property LLC, joins Nevada Rural Housing Authority’s portfolio of 13 affordable housing communities located throughout the rural and frontier parts of the state. Hafen Village offers a diverse group of households a variety of unit options, with rents starting at $812 for a one-bedroom with all utilities included. Unit are generously sized: a one-bedroom, one-bathroom is 688 square feet; a two -bedroom, one-bathroom is 912 square feet; and a three-bedroom, two-bathroom is 1,176 square feet. All units have a patio or balcony, air conditioning, and extra storage. The community also provides residents access to a fitness room, computer lab, library, dog park, playground, and free laundry on site. “As an organization committed to providing affordable housing opportunities to all rural Nevadans, we are proud to stand alongside our partners in celebrating the grand opening of Hafen Village Apartments,” said Bill Brewer, executive director at Nevada Rural Housing Authority. “It’s encouraging to see a project like this come to life because it means 96 more rural Nevadans now have a secure and safe place to call home.” For more information about the Bank’s dedication to expanding access to affordable housing opportunities, visit www.fhlbsf.com/community-programs.

The developments of Block A (The Estuary I, The Estuary II, and Linnet Corner) represent the first phase of AHA’s North Housing Master Plan. The North Housing Master Plan is a multi-year commitment for AHA, along with Island City Development, to create 586 homes to serve low-income Alamedans in need of affordable housing. The twelve acres allocated for North Housing is situated at the former naval base and was granted to the Housing Authority (in 2019) via the Surplus Land Act by the U.S. Department of Navy. AHA has committed nearly $15 million dollars of its own funds in loans to its affiliate Island City Development and has allocated 120 Project Based Vouchers towards The Estuary I, The Estuary II, and Linnet Corner. Island City Development, an affiliate of AHA, is the developer of this project and the Housing Authority of the City of Alameda owns the land. The architect for Linnet Corner, The Estuary I, and The Estuary II is HKIT Architects. The General Contractor is J.H. Fitzmaurice. Once both properties open in summer of 2025, all leasing and property management services will be provided by FPI Management. Building Futures, along with the Alameda Point Collaborative, will lead comprehensive case management and supportive services for residents at The Estuary I. LifeSTEPS will provide case management and resident services at Linnet Corner. “New affordable housing and supportive services have never been more desperately needed. Projects, like North Housing, make a real difference for people experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity, giving them a place to call home and helping them onto a path of stability and prosperity.”, said Tomiquia Moss, Secretary of California’s Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency. Funders to the project include the City of Alameda (HOME, Community Block Development Grant, Permanent Local Housing Allocation, and Inclusionary Housing funds), US. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco’s (FHLBSF) Affordable Housing Program (AHP), the Bank of Marin, California Debt Limit Allocation Committee (CDLAC), California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (TCAC) and the California Municipal Finance Authority (CMFA), the California Department of Veteran Affairs (Cal Vet), the Veterans and Affordable Housing Bond Act of 2018, the Infill Infrastructure Grant Program (IIG), the Multifamily Housing Program (MHP), and the Veterans Housing and Homelessness Prevention program (VHHP) through the California Department of Housing and Community Development, and the Local Alameda Affordable Housing Trust Fund. “The North Housing Master Plan in Alameda County is a tremendously important public-private effort that will transform the former Naval Air Station into much needed affordable housing for our most vulnerable community members, including seniors, those at-risk of becoming homeless, and homeless veterans, and families with children. Bank of America is proud to provide construction financing and serve as the tax credit investor for these initial two projects breaking ground today.” said Gioia McCarthy, San Francisco-East Bay president, Bank of America. “These new service-rich communities will provide critical onsite support that can have a transformational impact on both residents and the neighborhood”. Bank of America, N.A will provide construction financing. The California Community Reinvestment Corporation will provide Linnet Corner’s permanent financing and Enterprise Housing Credit Investment will provide the tax credit investments. “Home should be a place of pride, power, and belonging for everyone, regardless of income, and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit is one of our most powerful tools in that charge,” said Kari Downes, president of Enterprise’s housing tax credit business. “We’re proud to partner with AHA in bringing more than 100 good homes to Alameda’s most vulnerable residents.” Homes at The Estuary I and Linnet Corner will be assigned from the Alameda County Coordinated Entry System and the Housing Authority of the City of Alameda’s existing housing wait lists. Any additional housing units not requiring referrals from an AHA wait list, or the Alameda County Coordinated Entry System will be managed through interest lists run by AHA’s property management company, FPI Management.",https://yieldpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Untitled-1-31.jpeg,2024-04-25,0.576,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Alameda', 'latitude': 37.76520919799805, 'longitude': -122.24163818359375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'AHA', 'latitude': 8.583330154418945, 'longitude': 3.5, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Block', 'latitude': 45.39873123168945, 'longitude': -97.35595703125, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Navy', 'latitude': 38.88983154296875, 'longitude': -77.37803649902344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HKIT', 'latitude': 21.100000381469727, 'longitude': 93.9000015258789, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Secretary', 'latitude': 38.61000061035156, 'longitude': -75.94889068603516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Grant', 'latitude': 43.317569732666016, 'longitude': -75.06044006347656, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HUD', 'latitude': 53.64799880981445, 'longitude': -1.784999966621399, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Marin', 'latitude': 49.67036056518555, 'longitude': 16.65070915222168, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Committee', 'latitude': -33.15781021118164, 'longitude': 26.832590103149414, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cal', 'latitude': 40.206668853759766, 'longitude': 34.9162712097168, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Alameda County', 'latitude': 37.59992980957031, 'longitude': -121.8843994140625, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank of America', 'latitude': 37.79444122314453, 'longitude': -122.40306091308594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'East Bay', 'latitude': 37.01272964477539, 'longitude': -119.65264129638672, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Enterprise', 'latitude': 36.02524948120117, 'longitude': -115.241943359375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Low', 'latitude': 40.78548812866211, 'longitude': -112.9405288696289, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco's Affordable Housing Program (AHP) is a funder of the North Housing Master Plan in Alameda County, which will create 586 affordable homes for low-income Alamedans.
