Many CTV publishers have been investing in first-party data for years, making Publisher Advertiser Identity Reconciliation (PAIR) a valuable and durable solution in the streaming space. PAIR provides a privacy-focused way for advertisers and publishers to securely reconcile their first-party data, which enables marketers to show relevant ads to high-intent audiences, like past purchasers. So far, PAIR has delivered strong results for advertisers, and according to LiveRamp, PAIR audiences enable 11% incremental reach compared to cookie-based lists.3 Publishers like NBCUniversal and Disney, alongside clean room providers like LiveRamp and Infosum, are embracing PAIR, signaling a strong appetite among the industry. To further scale this privacy-forward solution, we're collaborating to build open standards and contributing the PAIR protocol to the IAB Tech Lab. This will enable ad tech companies — and the industry as a whole — to adopt privacy-forward audience solutions that benefit everyone. ""We're eagerly looking forward to ushering the PAIR protocol into an open industry standard,"" says Shailley Singh, EVP, Product, and COO, IAB Tech Lab. “It's a big step towards making privacy-enhancing technologies mainstream in the programmatic supply chain."" Streamline your streaming with Google AI The rise of programmatic advertising brought efficiency to media buying but it's time to evolve even further.

Why I chose Google over Microsoft and Meta - Business Insider,Why I chose Google over Microsoft and Meta  Business Insider,"Sat, 27 Apr 2024 23:39:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGhpcy1pcy13aHktaS1jaG9zZS1nb29nbGUtb3Zlci1taWNyb3NvZnQtYW5kLW1ldGEtMjAyNC000gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS90aGlzLWlzLXdoeS1pLWNob3NlLWdvb2dsZS1vdmVyLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1hbmQtbWV0YS0yMDI0LTQ_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Business Insider,"This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with a Google employee who requested anonymity to protect their privacy. Business Insider has verified their identity and offer letters. The following has been edited for length and clarity.I started at a top-ranked school for tech about four years ago. When I first entered, I was undecided about my career path.But by my sophomore year, I had my eyes set on FANG, also known as Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. My ultimate dream was to work at Google.During my sophomore year, I started grinding on applications for the summer.My GPA at the time was a 4.0, which definitely helped. But I also spent a ton of time doing LeetCode practice, which are algorithm brain teasers to test if you understand the fundamentals of theoretical computer science.My hard work paid off and I was able to get an offer from Google, Facebook, and Amazon.I ended up interning at Google for two summers, and the experience was everything I hoped for. I received great mentorship and worked on interesting projects that I learned a lot from.When I finished my second internship, I received hiring-committee approval, which allows former interns to get matched with a team full time.The issue was that it wasn't a guaranteed match — and if you don't get matched within a year, it expires.I started off the job-hunt process pretty confident. But a couple of months before graduating, I still hadn't heard from Google.I sent several follow-ups asking about the matching process, but they had no updates for me.So I started looking at other companies and ended up applying to at least 100 companies over the next few months. Once the market picked up, I started to receive a lot of DMs and cold emails from recruiters, including Meta.I spent a couple of months interviewing and eventually received offers from Meta and Microsoft. Right as I was about to accept my offer from Meta, Google let me know that they found a match for me.The offers from Meta and Google were most attractive to me so I was deciding between those two.Meta gave me a better offer initially. It included $131,000 in base pay, 10% of my base as a bonus with the potential for an additional 10% based on performance, a $16,000 signing bonus, and $150,000 in stock options over four years. The total compensation came out to around $210,700.The companywide performance bonus isn't given out every year, but if it does well, it will most likely be given out to its engineers.Google originally offered me less in total compensation, but I was able to get them to increase the offer to $218,360 in total compensation, including a $138,000 base salary, 15% bonus, and $157,000 in stock options over four years.Google also offered a $13,000 cash stipend for relocation, which made a difference. Meta's relocation package offered cash in lieu of some of the services they offered, like employment housing for 30 days, but the recruiter told me I could only cash out up to $5,000.Google's front-loaded stock schedule also made a big difference in my first-year compensation, which appealed to me. At Google, I would receive 38% in the first year, 32% in the second year, 20% in the third year, and 10% in the fourth. At Meta, I would've received 25% every year.Google also offered work for a month anywhere in the world, which was pretty cool.Both have hybrid work structures, but Meta seemed stricter about it. The recruiter at Meta told me three days a week in person were required. At Google, it was a suggestion, and in the two summers I worked there, it wasn't enforced. Some weeks I didn't come in person at all and it wasn't an issue.If Google didn't increase its total compensation offer, I would've had a really tough decision to make. But I still would have chosen Google because the role itself was more interesting to me.That, and it's the company I always wanted to work for.Google made an impact on me early on. Before college and working in tech, Google was a name that stood out to me. It's a hallmark of company culture, and it started off bigger than the other tech companies that have emerged.Google may not be the one leading the AI train, but I think they'll catch up. Google is the top search engine in the world. They have access to a ton of data.After working at Google for two summers, I know how the company runs, and I believe in its vision.",https://i.insider.com/6597edc91c5c7b8c9a0e3a6e?width=1000&format=jpeg,2024-04-27,-0.049,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Facebook', 'description': 'American social media and technology company', 'full_name': 'Meta Platforms', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Meta_Platforms_Headquarters_Menlo_Park_California.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Netflix', 'description': 'American multinational entertainment company', 'full_name': 'Netflix', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Netflix_headquarters.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'FANG', 'latitude': 19.916889190673828, 'longitude': 99.2145004272461, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Amazon', 'latitude': 46.32020950317383, 'longitude': -112.10722351074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'GPA', 'latitude': 7.949999809265137, 'longitude': -11.566670417785645, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DMs', 'latitude': 51.15570068359375, 'longitude': -0.0042500002309679985, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meta', 'latitude': 40.63920974731445, 'longitude': 14.41823959350586, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",I don t know,"A Google employee interned at Google for two summers and received a full-time offer with a total compensation of $218,360, including a $138,000 base salary, 15% bonus, and $157,000 in stock options over four years.

The workers were sacked following protests at Google offices in New York City and Sunnyvale, California, organized by No Tech for Apartheid – an alliance of Google and Amazon workers who have been protesting against a $1.2bn contract with the Israeli government called Project Nimbus that they claim will make it “easier for the Israeli government to surveil Palestinians and force them off their land”. Initially, Google fired 28 workers over the protests and then fired more than 20 workers a few days later. The firings are the largest to occur since Israel’s military campaign in response to the 7 October 2023 terrorist attack by Hamas in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 hostages were taken. Since then, more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, including more than 14,000 children and 9,670 women. Google has fired and reprimanded workers for participating in protests before, such as over a 2018 walkout and sit-in protest about sexual harassment issues at the company, but not previously to this extent. In March, Google fired a cloud engineer who protested against an Israel tech event in New York City. Emaan Haseem, a software engineer at Google and organizer with No Tech for Apartheid, was one of the fired workers. “Many of us had just recently gotten promoted. I was the fastest promoted person underneath my manager,” she said. This was a peaceful protest, she said, “with high visibility, high transparency, that we livestreamed. Everything and everybody could see how it went.” Haseem said the sit-in protests were a response to Google’s refusal to engage with workers’ concerns. “Look at the way Google has overreacted, so emotionally, and has lashed out at 50 workers over this contract rather than giving any more transparency, clarity, or attempting to prove they are not especially providing the Israeli military resources to aid and abet their genocide and continue their apartheid,” added Haseem. “They fully had the option to do that but instead they chose to throw a tantrum and take it out on 50 workers, many of whom were not involved in the sit-in. “It was done so emotionally, so irrationally, that Google has also taken its mask off in the process. It has shown its honest and true self, how contradictory they are, how they don’t actually care about doing the right thing, about not being evil, about their values where we should speak up and speak out against anything wrong that we see happening in our work or in the workplace.” Since the contract was awarded in 2021, workers at Google and Amazon have been organizing in opposition to the corporations’ joint contract with the Israeli military and government. The $1.2bn contract to provide cloud services “allows for further surveillance of and unlawful data collection on Palestinians, and facilitates expansion of Israel’s illegal settlements on Palestinian land”, according to an op-ed workers wrote in 2021. The firings have disrupted the financial stability of workers, Haseem said, but she and others affected have received significant support from co-workers and others. She also said that one of the biggest challenges with the campaign against Project Nimbus was outreach and educating others on the issues – something which Google’s firings had only facilitated. Hasan Ibraheem, a Google software engineer in New York who was fired and arrested for participating in the protest, said he and other workers were put on administrative leave, losing corporate access, and then fired the next day by email en masse. “We don’t know of anyone who had actually been reached out to by HR. We were asked no questions. There was no consulting with us. No one asked us anything. It was just a very cold mass email sent out, you are now fired, goodbye, because they don’t want to deal with us, they want to silence us and we’re not going to stay silent,” said Ibraheem. “We don’t want our labor to be used for aiding a genocide and that’s why we did that action and we are going to continue fighting to have this project dropped.” The workers declined to comment on any potential legal proceedings they may pursue in response to the firings. No Tech for Apartheid called the firings “illegal” in a blogpost in response to Google’s actions. A spokesperson for Google said in an email on the firings: “We continued our investigation into the physical disruption inside our buildings on April 16, looking at additional details provided by coworkers who were physically disrupted, as well as those employees who took longer to identify because their identity was partly concealed – like by wearing a mask without their badge – while engaged in the disruption. Our investigation into these events is now concluded, and we have terminated the employment of additional employees who were found to have been directly involved in disruptive activity.” They denied firing any employees not involved. Google also denied protesters’ characterizations of Project Nimbus, stating: “We have been very clear that the Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy. This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b22f31150e60f0e44b207a0575b49c747cc46961/0_272_8158_4895/master/8158.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c31390dd2845770003c42b4937ebcb3c,2024-04-27,-0.558,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York City', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sunnyvale', 'latitude': 37.368831634521484, 'longitude': -122.03634643554688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tech', 'latitude': 20.950000762939453, 'longitude': -75.96666717529297, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Amazon', 'latitude': 46.32020950317383, 'longitude': -112.10722351074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Israel', 'latitude': 31.5, 'longitude': 34.75, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hamas', 'latitude': 41.25014114379883, 'longitude': 43.0554084777832, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gaza', 'latitude': 31.5, 'longitude': 34.466670989990234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nimbus', 'latitude': 38.62907028198242, 'longitude': -121.2152328491211, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Google fired over 50 workers for protesting a $1.2bn contract with the Israeli government, Project Nimbus, which protesters claim will aid in the surveillance and displacement of Palestinians.

[+] 2023 in Warsaw, Poland. (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images This story was updated April 29th. Update below. Following Samsung's surprise AI announcement, Google is now rolling out the Gemini app to even more Android users. When the company first announced the Gemini for Android app earlier this year, it said it would only be for devices running Android 12 and up. But now the latest version of Gemini for Android—v1.0.626720042—can be installed via the Play Store for older devices running Android 10 and Android 11. Spotted on Twitter/X by @isumantadas, tests by Artem Russakovskii from Android Police and 9To5Google show that Gemini does indeed work on phones running Android 10 and 11, and the experience is just as functional as it is on a newer handset. ForbesGoogle's Unexpected New Nest Devices Reveal Confused FutureBy Janhoi McGregor This is a big move by Google, not least because both operating systems are still wildly popular. Android 10 and 11 currently make up 8.82% and 16.57% of the global Android install base respectively. That’s millions of devices that now have access to Google’s latest AI technology.

Will more handsets get Circle to Search at some point? Or other Pixel-exclusive AI-powered features? Gemini’s support page says that a device running the app needs 4GB of RAM to run properly—a lot of devices fall into that bracket. It will be interesting to see how far Google can push Gemini, and Gemini-related tools, to phones deep in the Android universe. Both Google and Samsung have surprised users by rolling out headline AI tools to older phones. Recently Samsung announced that its Galaxy S23 range would be updated with Live Translate, Circle to Search, Note Assist, generative image editing and some other AI features. A month later it announced that the Galaxy S22 series would get the same update. ForbesGoogle Slashes The Price Of The Pixel 8 Range AgainBy Janhoi McGregor Only four months ago those tools were exclusive to the Galaxy S24. Google also consistently updates older devices with new features via its Feature Drop program, so there’s a precedent here that may bear more fruit in the future. This shouldn’t be a surprise, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has already declared that we are in the ""Gemini Era"", back in January. Google has yet to confirm the Gemini update. But I imagine that the company will be holding tight until next month’s I/O Conference where we can expect a raft of Gemini announcements. Update April 29th: Google has now published its schedule for I/O 2024 and, as expected, AI will feature heavily in the speeches and announcements. There are, of course, no specifics on the content of the speeches, but it’s clear that Gemini will be mentioned a few times by several speakers in different areas. On the I/O schedule site, “Gemini” is mentioned 20 times. Google says that Gemini will play a role in building “next-gen AI apps” and further integrate with Maps. There’s also a promise that we will learn about “what’s new” with the Gemini API and how generative AI works with the upcoming Android 15 operating system. I suspect Google will officially confirm that Gemini is now available on Android 10 and 11 at I/O. But that will be part of a wider announcement about new features, which might come to older devices too. There has been a clear pattern from Samsung and Google when it comes to rolling out new AI features to older devices. Neither company will want to miss out on making the most out of an obvious marketing opportunity. Check out my website.

Michigan AG executes search warrants on Google and X in ongoing 2020 fake electors probe - CNN,Michigan AG executes search warrants on Google and X in ongoing 2020 fake electors probe  CNN,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 21:39:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNC8yOS9wb2xpdGljcy9taWNoaWdhbi1zZWFyY2gtd2FycmFudHMtZ29vZ2xlLXR3aXR0ZXItMjAyMC1mYWtlLWVsZWN0b3JzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAWZodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA0LzI5L3BvbGl0aWNzL21pY2hpZ2FuLXNlYXJjaC13YXJyYW50cy1nb29nbGUtdHdpdHRlci0yMDIwLWZha2UtZWxlY3RvcnM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"Google and X, formerly Twitter, recently provided hundreds of files to Michigan prosecutors for their 2020 election subversion probe, complying with search warrants that investigators obtained after CNN revealed secret social media accounts belonging to pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, who played a major role in the fake electors plot. The previously unreported warrants gave prosecutors access to new Chesebro emails and his private direct messages on Twitter. The warrants make clear that Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is still gathering new information in her probe, nine months after she charged the state’s fake electors with forgery and other crimes for signing certificates falsely claiming Donald Trump won the state in 2020. A top member of her team testified last week that the investigation is ongoing and that Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in the case, which is not expected to go to trial before the November election. Michigan is among a number of states to investigate fake electors schemes. Just last week, Arizona prosecutors filed criminal charges against the pro-Trump electors there and allies of the former president who were involved in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. According to the new documents provided to Michigan prosecutors, which were obtained by CNN, Chesebro fruitlessly tried to bring several controversial pro-Trump figures to Washington, DC, to watch his “fake electors” strategy unfold on January 6, 2021. He offered to pay for airfare and lodging at Trump’s upscale DC hotel for former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, as well as for the founder of the Gateway Pundit conspiracy website, among others. It doesn’t appear that anyone accepted his offers. These messages also show how Chesebro aggressively reached out to conservative pundits and right-wing figures after Trump lost the 2020 election, prodding them to publicly promote his long-shot theories for how to subvert the Electoral College process. The search warrants to Google and X were executed in March, shortly after CNN reported that Chesebro had concealed some of his social media accounts from prosecutors during his cooperation session last year. Chesebro has not been charged in Michigan, and he has pleaded guilty in Georgia’s election interference probe. CNN has reached out to Chesebro’s attorneys for comment. Gining up support The direct messages obtained by CNN chronicle how Chesebro, while advising the Trump campaign on the fake electors plot, was also trying to garner friendly news coverage by relentlessly pitching to conservative radio hosts and pro-Trump pundits. He shared what appeared to be unsolicited guidance to Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft, advising him on how to frame his site’s coverage of the January 6 certification proceeding in Congress. “It would help to publicize that if (then-Vice President Mike) Pence claims the power to resolve disputes about the electoral votes on Jan. 6, he’d simply be doing what (Thomas) Jefferson did,” Chesebro told Hoft in a message on December 27, 2020. “Excellent!! Thanks,” Hoft responded, using the @GatewayPundit account. Two days later, Chesebro told Hoft that he had reserved a block of rooms at the Trump International Hotel, and that Hoft could stay there “gratis” if he wanted. Not long after that, Chesebro made similar offers to Clarke and his wife, as well as to Wisconsin-based radio host Vicki McKenna and her husband, according to emails obtained by CNN. “Happy to pay for flights if that would help,” Chesebro told McKenna, according to the documents. “It’s really no big deal; I’ve done very, very well financially the last few years. And I would feel great having you able to be at the center of the Trump universe!” Hoft informed Chesebro that he had his own lodging in DC. An attorney for Hoft declined to comment for this story. McKenna didn’t respond to requests for comment. Interview with investigators When Chesebro met with Nessel’s investigators in December, they asked about his social media accounts. In addition to concealing his secret Twitter account, Chesebro told investigators that he didn’t use social media applications to send and receive private messages. That denial is undercut by the materials X gave to investigators, which contain more than 160 sent messages and more than 25 received messages between 2014 and 2021, with most of them amid the 2020 election fallout. During the closed-door interview, an investigator asked Chesebro which social media apps he used where people “can direct-message you, private-message you,” according to a recording obtained by CNN. Chesebro responded, “The only messaging apps I’ve used – like for messages, right? I understand that there’s that capability – are iMessage.” He further said, “I know there’s direct message Twitter,” but he did not say that he used Twitter for direct messaging. Chesebro’s lawyer didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the discrepancy. Instant pushback In the wake of the 2020 election, Chesebro also sent some direct messages on Twitter to James Wigderson, a longtime writer on Wisconsin politics who ran a conservative news site. Chesebro was trying to gin up coverage of claims that there were irregularities in the Wisconsin results, according to documents obtained by CNN. “You can spare me this stuff. Thanks. Trump lost,” Wigderson told Chesebro, later adding, “I really don’t have time for conspiracy theories. Thanks for understanding.” Parts of this exchange were previously reported by The New York Times. Chesebro also privately pinged several other Wisconsin political pundits and legal scholars, including some whom he sparred with in public Twitter posts. Most were ignored. One of the attorneys Chesebro privately targeted was Daniel Rodriguez, who attended Northwestern University’s law school with Chesebro and is now a professor there. On December 29, 2020, Chesebro sent link to Rodriguez about a new lawsuit from the Trump campaign trying to overturn the Wisconsin results. Rodriguez replied with “LOL.” “I don’t remember this exchange exactly,” Rodriguez told CNN in an email, “but my best guess is that the ‘LOL’ was because this whole false electors lawsuit business was, and is, insane.” The Wisconsin litigation – like dozens of other Trump election suits – failed in court. This story has been updated with additional details.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1735346297.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2024-04-29,-0.299,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Twitter', 'description': 'American social networking site', 'full_name': 'Twitter', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Capturadeteledacontadawikipedianotwitter.png'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Donald Trump', 'description': '45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021', 'full_name': 'Donald Trump', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Donald_Trump_official_portrait.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Michigan', 'latitude': 44.25028991699219, 'longitude': -85.50032806396484, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CNN', 'latitude': 51.54853820800781, 'longitude': -0.09250999987125397, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Trump', 'latitude': 38.849159240722656, 'longitude': -105.78833770751953, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Donald', 'latitude': 46.47652053833008, 'longitude': -120.396728515625, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Arizona', 'latitude': 34.500301361083984, 'longitude': -111.5009765625, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'College', 'latitude': 43.66128921508789, 'longitude': -79.38308715820312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Georgia', 'latitude': 32.75041961669922, 'longitude': -83.50018310546875, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Congress', 'latitude': 34.16252899169922, 'longitude': -112.85073852539062, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Vice', 'latitude': -5.416669845581055, 'longitude': -80.78333282470703, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Thomas', 'latitude': 47.35371017456055, 'longitude': -122.22901153564453, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Jefferson', 'latitude': 34.11705017089844, 'longitude': -83.5723876953125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hoft', 'latitude': 48.16666030883789, 'longitude': 13.750929832458496, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Trump International Hotel', 'latitude': 40.76890182495117, 'longitude': -73.9813003540039, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Clarke', 'latitude': 43.966819763183594, 'longitude': -78.54955291748047, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wisconsin', 'latitude': 44.500240325927734, 'longitude': -90.00041198730469, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'McKenna', 'latitude': 46.934818267822266, 'longitude': -122.55651092529297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nessel', 'latitude': 45.70832061767578, 'longitude': -93.11421203613281, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'York', 'latitude': 39.96260070800781, 'longitude': -76.72773742675781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Northwestern University', 'latitude': 42.05559158325195, 'longitude': -87.67449951171875, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Rodriguez', 'latitude': 14.731399536132812, 'longitude': 121.1417007446289, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'LOL', 'latitude': 11.982780456542969, 'longitude': 42.27444076538086, 'location_type': 'REGION'}]",I don t know,"Google and X provided Michigan prosecutors with Chesebro's emails and Twitter direct messages related to the 2020 election subversion probe.

Google Fired Us for Protesting Its Complicity in the War on Gaza. But We Won’t Be Silenced. - The Nation,Google Fired Us for Protesting Its Complicity in the War on Gaza. But We Won’t Be Silenced.

Some workers occupied Google’s New York offices. Others occupied the Sunnyvale, California, office of Thomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud. This protest was an escalation of the ongoing No Tech for Apartheid (NOTA) campaign, which has been demanding for years that Google and Amazon cancel Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal that Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services signed with the Israeli military and government in 2021. The contract provides cloud computing and AI technology for Israel’s apartheid state, contributing to state violence and now to Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. The day after the protests, we learned that Google had fired 30 of us, including those not actively part of the sit-ins. The following Monday, we learned that Google fired an additional 20 workers, including non-participating bystanders. Google claims everyone fired had been “directly involved in disruptive activity,” but its leadership has yet to even provide an accurate count for the number of workers impacted by its retaliation. We have had to rely on a self-reported count from workers themselves. We are disappointed, outraged, and disheartened by Google’s refusal to engage with us. We participated in this protest because we could see all too clearly how our day-to-day work at Google was aiding and abetting Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza. As tech workers, we see how Google, like Meta and other tech corporations, has engaged double standards by allowing Zionists to promote atrocity propaganda while simultaneously suppressing Palestinian voices. (This pattern of censorship long predates the current war.) We have been distressed to see our own creativity, innovation, and love of technology be used for warfare. Many of our coworkers asked to be reassigned to different projects or took leaves in feeble attempts to distance ourselves from Project Nimbus and other military contracts. We also tried to engage our leaders with petitions, through office hour meetings, at company town halls, and through internal message boards and employee groups. Instead of engaging with us in good faith, our leadership evaded our concerns, targeted messages that expressed support for Palestine or opposition to the genocide, and censored our internal communications network. These actions have particularly impacted our Palestinian, Muslim, and Arab colleagues, who are facing an internal culture of hate, abuse, and retaliation. Ultimately, we felt we had no choice but to band together and disrupt business as usual in order to make our demands heard. We’d like to reiterate those demands: First, Google must cancel its Project Nimbus contract and immediately cease doing business with the Israeli apartheid government and military. Second, Google must stop the harassment, intimidation, bullying, silencing, and censorship of Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim Googlers. Third, Google must address the health and safety crisis among Google workers. (Multiple workers have quit citing the serious mental health consequences of working at a company that is using their labor to enable a genocide.) And lastly, Google must stop the retaliation against and doxxing of workers speaking out, and create a safe working environment for all workers. Since 2021, as Google workers with NOTA, we have raised concerns about the potential surveillance and military use of our AI. In response, our “leadership” denied the military nature of Project Nimbus, claiming that the contract provides cloud computing for civilian purposes only. In November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he was “proud to be doing Project Nimbus as a partner to like-minded governments that share democratic values around the world.” Yet, despite Google supposedly prohibiting using its tech for “immediate harm,” Israel is harnessing Google Photos facial recognition to create a “hit list” of Palestinians. Just a few weeks ago, Time revealed that Google does, in fact, have a direct contract with the Israeli Ministry of Defense as part of “an Israel/Nimbus deal.” What’s more, Time reported that “the tech giant has negotiated deepening its partnership during Israel’s war in Gaza.” Clearly, our executives have blatantly lied to us, as they continue to profit from the murder of over 30,000 Palestinians and the destruction of life in Gaza. The unprecedented scale of death and destruction in Gaza is enabled by tech companies like Google. Dubbed “the world’s first AI war,” ongoing journalistic investigations about Gaza demonstrate how AI-powered target selection systems operate in tandem to profile Palestinian civilians as “terrorists,” select them as targets, and permit ruthless bombings against civilians. As +972 Magazine has reported, “The Gospel” classifies buildings as military bases; “Lavender” and “Where’s Daddy” identify and classify Palestinian civilians as terrorists under false pretenses and track their movements for target selection. The Israeli Ministry of Defense deploys automated decision systems deliberately to remove human deliberation. As one Israeli source told +972, “the machine did it coldly.” AI is one of today’s weapons of mass destruction, and Google is a willing war profiteer. Systems like The Gospel and Lavender are made possible through the kind of cloud computing infrastructure that companies like Google, AWS, and Intel provide. “These technologies, initially used to enforce violent occupation, apartheid, and genocide have found a lucrative global market, stretching far beyond the confines of Palestine,” write cybersecurity experts at the Tor Project. We proudly participated in this sit-in as Google workers who believe in the power of collective worker-led disruption of labor in the workplace for Palestinian liberation, anti-discrimination, and anti-repression. We reject complicity and silence amidst Google’s pursuit of profit at the expense of human lives. We demand that the technological products of our labor not be sold to the Israeli military as it commits a genocide against the Palestinian people and that none of our technology be used to harm, oppress, surveil, or kill people. We are not alone in experiencing retaliation. We stand in unwavering solidarity with workers and students everywhere who also see how powerful institutions in academia, journalism, and more, aid and abet the attack on Palestinian lives. The repression we face here, among healthcare workers, students, journalists, and tech workers who are speaking out, is nothing in comparison to the daily lived experiences of Palestinians at this moment. We call on all Google, Amazon, and tech workers to join the No Tech For Apartheid campaign and build power with us to demand our bosses divest from Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza now. As code becomes tantamount to weaponry, this call could not be more urgent.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1848365584.jpg,2024-04-29,-0.027,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sunnyvale', 'latitude': 37.368831634521484, 'longitude': -122.03634643554688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tech', 'latitude': 20.950000762939453, 'longitude': -75.96666717529297, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NOTA', 'latitude': 41.133331298828125, 'longitude': 140.64999389648438, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Amazon', 'latitude': 46.32020950317383, 'longitude': -112.10722351074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Israel', 'latitude': 31.5, 'longitude': 34.75, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gaza', 'latitude': 31.5, 'longitude': 34.466670989990234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meta', 'latitude': 3.5, 'longitude': -73.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Palestine', 'latitude': 31.92156982421875, 'longitude': 35.20328903198242, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Muslim', 'latitude': 39.75265884399414, 'longitude': 32.08021926879883, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Arab', 'latitude': 37.093658447265625, 'longitude': -90.07676696777344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Time', 'latitude': 39.56111145019531, 'longitude': -90.72306060791016, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Magazine', 'latitude': 35.15092086791992, 'longitude': -93.80686950683594, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Daddy', 'latitude': 6.933800220489502, 'longitude': 3.4530599117279053, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Lavender', 'latitude': 1.307170033454895, 'longitude': 103.86300659179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Intel', 'latitude': 37.38793182373047, 'longitude': -121.96353912353516, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tor', 'latitude': 28.236379623413086, 'longitude': 33.62540054321289, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,Not-related content

Underneath the AI overview are links allowing you to dive deeper into your search. Above the text is a disclaimer: “AI overviews are experimental.” AI-powered overviews aren’t available for all searches, Google says. Google also admits the overviews may not hit the nail on the head every time. “Because generative AI is experimental and a work in progress, it can and will make mistakes,” the company writes. Not only will AI tools sometimes “misunderstand” the nature of your question or search topic, they could also completely make something up. “When generative AI invents an answer, it’s called a hallucination,” the company says. It’s because of how large language models, or LLMs, work. They don’t just gather information that’s already published on the internet. These models actually try to “predict which words come next based on user inputs,” says Google. One example of a “hallucination,” according to Google Support, might happen if you ask about the future.

The Justice Department filed the suit in January 2023, alleging Google abused its dominance in digital advertising and should be forced to sell its ad manager suite, a key revenue generator.Google, in its defense, argued the DOJ's claims exceeded ""the boundaries of antitrust law"" and did not justify regulating its business practices. The company maintained the government's case was ""doomed"" as it targeted lawful actions like choosing business partners and improving products for customer benefit.The Justice Department declined to comment, but their original complaint accused Google of ""anticompetitive"" and ""unlawful"" means to maintain dominance in digital advertising technology.Advertising makes up about three-quarters of Google's revenue, with its online advertising network, including the ad manager suite, contributing 12% in 2021.The Virginia federal court judge overseeing the case has scheduled a trial for September 2023. The judge can potentially limit the lawsuit's scope or dismiss it entirely before trial.

Despite this, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has not shown that Google commands a 70% share of the online advertising market, the company said in a court filing asking a judge to summarily dismiss the suit. According to a Saturday (April 27) report by Bloomberg News, Google alleges that the department “made up markets specifically for this case” of display advertising shown on the open web. In doing so, the company said, the government ignores rivals like Facebook, Instagram, Amazon and TikTok, all of them vying for online ad dollars. “There can be no serious claim that ad placement on mobile apps and social media should be excluded in market share calculations,” Google said in its motion. If the judge were to grant the summary dismissal, it would end the government’s case before it could be brought to trial. PYMNTS has contacted the DOJ for comment but has not yet gotten a reply. The department sued Google last year, alleging the company had illegally seized control of the online ad sector and called for the company to be broken up. “Having inserted itself into all aspects of the digital advertising marketplace, Google has used anti-competitive, exclusionary, and unlawful means to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies,” the department said in the suit. The suit, filed by the DOJ and eight U.S. states, asks a judge to order the divestiture of “at minimum,” the Google Ad Manager suite, which includes both Google’s publisher ad server, DFP, and Google’s ad exchange, AdX. Meanwhile, PYMNTS last week examined Google’s latest earnings call, which focused — as many big tech companies do these days — on artificial intelligence (AI). That report noted that CEO Sundar Pichai did what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had not done the day before. “He connected AI to ROI.

The results for the first three months of the year provided the latest evidence that Google has regained its momentum after an unprecedented downturn in 2022 coming out of the pandemic. Alphabet punctuated its renewed vigor by also disclosing plans to begin paying shareholders a quarterly dividend for the first time since since Google went public 20 years ago. It’s something that two older technology powerhouses, Microsoft and Apple, have been doing for years. Alphabet's quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share will be paid June 17. Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro praised the decision to pay a dividend as “a breath of fresh air for the tech market” that should also make investors more likely to support the increased amounts that Google will likely need to spend on developing AI products that could take years to pay off. In the January-March period, Alphabet’s revenue rose 15% from the same time last year to $80.54 billion, which surpassed the projections of analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. It marked the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth for the Mountain View, California, company. Alphabet earned $23.66 billion, or $1.89 per share, a 57% increase from last year's comparable quarter. The earnings per share also eclipsed the analyst estimates that steer investors. “We are incredibly well set up, given the innovation path we are on,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday conference call. The company's stock price soared by nearly 13% in Thursday's extended trading after the news came out. That reaction was a stark contrast to how investors responded to a report covering the same quarter from Facebook's parent. Meta Platforms also reported a surge in ad revenue but provided a disappointing outlook for the April-June period, while also warning its profits would be squeezed by increased spending on AI technology. If Alphabet's shares move in a similar trajectory during Friday's regular trading session, the stock will hit a new all-time high that will push the company's market value above $2 trillion. As has been the case since throughout the company's history, most of the money came in through a digital advertising network anchored by Google’s dominant search engine. Google’s ad revenue totaled $61.66 billion in the first quarter, up 13% from last year. Despite the ongoing success, Google is facing dual threats that could threaten its future growth. The U.S. Department of Justice is taking aim at its search engine a lawsuit alleging the company has abused its power by negotiating lucrative deals with Apple and other companies to give it an unfair advantage over potential rivals, stifling innovation as well as competition. After a two-month trial last fall, the closing arguments in the biggest U.S. antitrust case in a quarter are scheduled to unfold next week and a federal judge is expected to rule whether Google has been breaking the law by the end of this year. People also may not need to rely as much on Google’s search information to answer their questions and find other information as the artificial intelligence technology that Google, Microsoft and other industry stalwarts are building becomes more sophisticated. If AI gradually supplants the role that Google’s search engine has filled for the past quarter century, Alphabet’s ad sales also could dwindle. For now, AI is helping to fuel rapid growth in Google’s cloud computing division, which saw its first-quarter revenue climb 28% from last year to $9.57 billion. But the cloud division also has become a tinder box for Google management as dozens of employees have staged protests over a $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government that includes AI technology as part of Project Nimbus. The protesting employees believe Project Nimbus is being lethally deployed by the Israeli military in the Gaza war — a contention Google has denied. The divisive issue came to head earlier this month during an employee sit-in at Google offices in Sunnyvale, California, and New York that resulted in more than 50 workers being fired. Alphabet ended March with nearly 181,000 employees, a decrease of nearly 10,000 workers from the previous year. Management has cycled through several rounds of mass layoffs to help boost profits while Google ramps up its spending on AI technology.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/812eb102-7faa-4974-887b-9af64bbdcf1d/wirestory_9b01fc1ab86b4ec56b763ae257a42f06_16x9.jpg?w=1600,2024-04-25,-0.215,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'description': 'American holding company and parent company of Google', 'full_name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Googleplex_HQ_%28cropped%29.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Facebook', 'description': 'American social media and technology company', 'full_name': 'Meta Platforms', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Meta_Platforms_Headquarters_Menlo_Park_California.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mountain View', 'latitude': 37.386051177978516, 'longitude': -122.08384704589844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Justice', 'latitude': 36.62308883666992, 'longitude': -105.2541732788086, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gaza', 'latitude': 31.5, 'longitude': 34.466670989990234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sunnyvale', 'latitude': 37.368831634521484, 'longitude': -122.03634643554688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported a 15% increase in revenue to $80.54 billion in Q1 2023, driven by digital advertising and growth in its cloud computing division.

Despite Alphabet last week reporting a 57 percent year-on-year jump in net profit to $23.66 billion for calendar Q1, more roles are being expunged as the mega-corp cracks down on costs. The Python team is reportedly affected and an undisclosed number of Flutter and Dart engineers have been let go. A Reddit account under the name of Kevin Moore, a Google Product Manager for Flutter and Dart, posted: ""The layoffs were decided AT LEAST a couple of layers above our team and affected a LOT of teams. (I think I can say that.) ""Lots of good folks got bad news and lots of great projects lost people. Flutter and Dart were not affected any more or less [than] others. It was a tough day... tough week."" Does this mean that Flutter will be taking a tentative step toward the ""Killed by Google"" graveyard? Jamboard could always use the company. Google rings in 2024 with sweeping layoffs Google Bard AI contractors unionize amid anger over 'retaliatory' layoffs Having slammed brakes on hiring, Google says it no longer needs quite so many recruiters Google's APAC outpost joins the global job cuts club Flutter is an open source Dart-based UI toolkit designed to allow developers to create apps across multiple platforms, both mobile (Android and iOS) and desktop (Linux, macOS, and Windows.) It was making progress at the beginning of 2023 but now appears to have fallen victim to relentless cost-cutting at Google. As for the Python team, the current positions have reportedly been ""reduced"" in favor of a new team based in Munich. The Register contacted Google to verify the number of reductions, and to ask whether the cloud titan was still committed to the Flutter platform. We have yet to receive a response. Moore attempted to remain optimistic, noting that it was a sad situation, and ""crazy to be seeing demos and new things working and discussions about new customers the same day we lost colleagues and friends."" He said: ""You're nervous. I get it. We get it. You're betting on Flutter and Dart. So am I. So is Google."" To which one wag responded: ""We certainly are betting on Flutter... to be killed within a few years."" The cost cutting at Google began in January last year when 12,000 people or six percent of the workforce were made redundant. This was by far the most significant number of job losses in Google's history, and an acknowledgment that the numbers of people recruited during the pandemic was no longer sustainable given the downturn in business. That slowdown in business has now passed - clearly - but Google is looking to free up resources to spend more on priorities, including AI.

YouTube And Everything Else: Google Wants Marketers To Buy Their Streaming Through DV360 - AdExchanger,YouTube And Everything Else: Google Wants Marketers To Buy Their Streaming Through DV360  AdExchanger,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 17:40:15 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkZXhjaGFuZ2VyLmNvbS90di95b3V0dWJlLWFuZC1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLWVsc2UtZ29vZ2xlLXdhbnRzLW1hcmtldGVycy10by1idXktdGhlaXItc3RyZWFtaW5nLXRocm91Z2gtZHYzNjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,AdExchanger,"Google kicked off NewFronts with a glitzy presentation so it could strut its streaming stuff beyond its YouTube offerings. Meaning it heavily focused on its ad buying platform, Display and Video 360 (DV360). On Monday, Google unveiled updates to DV360 that should make it easier for advertisers to manage campaigns across Google and other connected TV publishers. Which means introducing more ways for brands to ink direct deals with publishers that aren’t Google – and to juggle those direct buys with biddable ones. Among the updates are more options for customized deals, a budget allocation tool for guaranteed and biddable deals and plans to publish open web standards for its Publisher Advertiser Identity Reconciliation (PAIR) framework. For marketers to maximize their streaming investment, they “need to see the whole picture of how their ads are performing” across publishers, regardless of deal type, said Kristen O’Hara, Google VP of agency, platforms and client solutions. Get it together Marketers want more cohesive planning and measurement, and they can now set up customized deals with top CTV publishers directly within DV360, rather than just relying on auction-based bidding. Previously, marketers only had this amount of flexibility with Google streaming inventory, namely YouTube. For example, in March, Google integrated DV360 directly with DRAX, Disney’s real-time ad exchange, to create direct pathways to its streaming inventory. NBCUniversal, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery are among other CTV publishers directly integrated with DV360. Now, advertisers can buy and manage both guaranteed and biddable deals across publishers using DV360. Buyers can also measure cross-platform campaigns based on brand lift, purchase intent and deduplicated reach between YouTube and other streamers. Consolidating video buys within DV360 also helps marketers manage ad frequency based on how their ads are performing, O’Hara said. She cited a recent partnership with French food and snack purveyor Danone (known as Dannon in the US) as an example. Since consolidating its video buys within DV360 last year, it has seen 50% more effectiveness against its KPIs, although O’Hara didn’t name what those KPIs are. Satisfaction guaranteed However, despite the advantages of direct deals, the scale and targeting possible through programmatic keeps biddable buying growing. That growth is why Google also announced a new product that promises to optimize reach across guaranteed and non-guaranteed deals. Using its own AI, Google allocates ad spend to reach as much of a brand’s target audience as possible across Google and third-party streaming inventory based on that brand’s frequency cap. Omnicom Media Group (OMG), one of the agencies testing the new product, can deliver up to three times as many impressions to a target audience compared to its previous buying strategy with Google, said Clare Ritchie, the agency’s SVP and global head of programmatic and in-housing, from Google’s NewFronts stage. A budget allocation tool that manages direct and biddable buys makes it easier for OMG to bid on more non-guaranteed inventory to add reach and impact to the agency’s buys on behalf of its clients, Ritchie said. PAIR up Last but not least, Google used its NewFronts stage to tout the potential of its PAIR framework for CTV, available through DV360. It allows publishers and advertisers to match their first-party data using LiveRamp’s clean room environment. PAIR can reach 11% more unique viewers compared to cookie-based audiences, according to LiveRamp. NBCUniversal and Disney were the first CTV publishers to integrate with PAIR. But other publishers, like Paramount, are also turning to PAIR to bring in first-party data – especially when performance and outcomes can improve by adding in this data. Tapping more first-party data, including retailer first-party data, should help “reach our most relevant consumers and move them down the [purchase] funnel,” said Pete Chelala, VP of programmatic ad sales at Paramount.

Google confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, but not the specific teams, roles or how many people were let go. “As we’ve said, we’re responsibly investing in our company’s biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,” said Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert. “To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Through this, we’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers,” he added. The company clarified that the layoffs were not company-wide but were reorgs that are part of the normal course of business. Affected employees will be able to apply for other open roles at Google, we’re told. In one X post, a PM from Flutter and Dart said the layoffs had affected “a LOT of teams,” and that “lots of great projects lost people.” “We’re sad, but still cranking hard on I/O and beyond,” wrote Google PM Kevin Moore in the Flutter development community on Reddit, where he added that Flutter and Dart weren’t affected any more or less than other teams. “We know ya’ll care SO MUCH about the project and the team and the awesome ecosystem we’ve built together. You’re nervous. I get it. We get it. You’re betting on Flutter and Dart. So am I. So is Google,” he said. Google also told TechCrunch that Flutter will have new updates to share at I/O this year. In a separate post on Reddit, another commenter noted the Python team affected by the layoffs were those who managed the internal Python runtimes and toolchains and worked with OSS Python. Included in this group were “multiple current and former core devs and steering council members,” they said. Meanwhile, others shared on Y Combinator’s Hacker News, where a Python team member detailed their specific duties on the technical front and noted that, for years, much of the work was done with fewer than 10 people. Another Hacker News commenter said their early years on the Python team were spent paying down internal technical debt accumulated from not having a strong Python strategy. “[D]espite the understaffing, we had managers who were extremely good about maintaining work/life balance and the ‘marathon, not sprint’ approach to work. As I said in another comment, it’s the best job I’ve ever had, and I’ll miss it deeply,” they wrote. “Python was one of the very first languages used widely at Google. It was the last major backend language to get a language team,” the user, gpshead, also said. Though Google didn’t detail headcount, some of the layoffs at Google may have been confirmed in a WARN notice filed on April 24. WARN, or the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, requires employers with more than 100 employees to provide 60-day notice in advance of layoffs. In the filing, Google said it was laying off a total of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale. On social media, commenters raised concerns with the Python layoffs in particular, given the role that Python tooling plays in AI. But others pointed out that Google didn’t eliminate its Python team; it replaced that team with another group based in Munich — at least according to Python Steering Council member Thomas Wouters in a post on Mastodon last Thursday. “It’s a tough day when everyone you work with directly, including your manager, is laid off — excuse me, ‘had their roles reduced,’ and you’re asked to onboard their replacements, people told to take those very same roles just in a different country who are not any happier about it,” he said. Google said it would support all affected employees, in line with local requirements, by providing them with time to search for different roles at Google or elsewhere, access to outplacement services and severance.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1002484746.jpg?w=680,2024-04-29,0.094,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Flutter', 'description': 'gesture recognition technology company', 'full_name': 'Flutter'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dart', 'latitude': 31.579999923706055, 'longitude': -7.559999942779541, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Python', 'latitude': 51.64693832397461, 'longitude': 5.053609848022461, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'LOT', 'latitude': -42.95000076293945, 'longitude': 146.4166717529297, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'WARN', 'latitude': 31.149999618530273, 'longitude': 74.5, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sunnyvale', 'latitude': 37.368831634521484, 'longitude': -122.03634643554688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Munich', 'latitude': 48.137428283691406, 'longitude': 11.57548999786377, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Council', 'latitude': 44.729888916015625, 'longitude': -116.43820190429688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mastodon', 'latitude': 65.5, 'longitude': -145.23333740234375, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",I don t know,"Google has laid off staff across key teams, including Flutter, Dart, and Python, as part of a reorganization to streamline operations and focus on priority projects.

Up until now, the rollout was very limited. Everyone should have access to the feature soon. Last November, Google Messages previewed its new custom-colored chat bubbles features for the RCS (Rich Communication Suite) chats. The search titan finally started rolling out the rich text feature for Google Messages. Users of the messaging app on Android can finally customize the color of the chat bubbles and backgrounds for different chats. Custom Chat Bubbles are only rolling out to some beta users at the moment According to a report by Android Police, Google has started offering Custom Bubbles and backgrounds in Google Messages. In RCS chats, the Custom Bubbles are now allegedly available in Google Messages beta version 20240228+. It appears to be a server-side update feature that’s rolling out to a few beta users at the moment. However, since Android users have finally started seeing Custom Bubbles in Google Messages, we can expect a wider rollout very soon. Google Messages is now offering as many as nine colors for Chat Bubbles As per various sources, Google Messages beta users are getting as many as nine colors for Chat Bubbles and the background. These include Default (Material You Dynamic Color), Blue, Turquoise, Purple, Green, Orange, Fuchsia, Pink, and Monochrome. The custom color themes apply to almost everything in the chats. However, the text fields and voice recorder buttons still remain light or dark. Thanks to the update, Google Messages users now have various options to change the aesthetics of their RCS chats. Interested users can tap the three vertical dots icon in their chats and select “Change colors” from the overflow menu. After pressing the button you will see a full-screen preview user interface, offering as many as nine new custom color choices. Keep in touch with us, we will update you once the feature starts rolling out globally to all Google Messages users. Google Messages reportedly blocking rich RCS messaging on rooted devices Recently, several reports from Reddit indicated that Google Messages is blocking the Rich Communication Services on rooted phones. This makes sense, as Google doesn’t really like people using rooted devices as they are less secure than the regular ones. Some people using rooted Android phones are reportedly losing capabilities via Google Messages altogether. If you are facing the same issue, then your only option is to use a messaging app other than Google Messages.",https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/0.-Google-Messages-Blog_Header.png,2024-04-29,0.008,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Fuchsia', 'description': 'American fashion company', 'full_name': 'Fuchsia'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Blue', 'latitude': 33.61006164550781, 'longitude': -109.10674285888672, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Turquoise', 'latitude': 30.049570083618164, 'longitude': -115.4458236694336, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Green', 'latitude': 38.345741271972656, 'longitude': -121.63967895507812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Orange', 'latitude': 33.78778839111328, 'longitude': -117.85311126708984, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pink', 'latitude': 37.779441833496094, 'longitude': -84.55110931396484, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Google Messages is rolling out custom RCS chat bubbles, allowing users to customize the color of chat bubbles and backgrounds.

Google Prevented 2.28 Million Malicious Apps from Reaching Play Store in 2023 - The Hacker News,Google Prevented 2.28 Million Malicious Apps from Reaching Play Store in 2023  The Hacker News,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 17:07:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGFja2VybmV3cy5jb20vMjAyNC8wNC9nb29nbGUtcHJldmVudGVkLTIyOC1taWxsaW9uLW1hbGljaW91cy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Hacker News,"Google on Monday revealed that almost 200,000 app submissions to its Play Store for Android were either rejected or remediated to address issues with access to sensitive data such as location or SMS messages over the past year. The tech giant also said it blocked 333,000 bad accounts from the app storefront in 2023 for attempting to distribute malware or for repeated policy violations. ""In 2023, we prevented 2.28 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play in part thanks to our investment in new and improved security features, policy updates, and advanced machine learning and app review processes,"" Google's Steve Kafka, Khawaja Shams, and Mohet Saxena said. ""To help safeguard user privacy at scale, we partnered with SDK providers to limit sensitive data access and sharing, enhancing the privacy posture for over 31 SDKs impacting 790K+ apps."" In comparison, Google fended off 1.43 million bad apps from being published to the Play Store in 2022, alongside banning 173,000 bad accounts over the same time period. In addition, the Mountain View-based firm said it strengthened its developer onboarding and review processes, requiring them to furnish more identity information and complete a verification process when setting up their Play Console developer accounts. This, the company noted, enables it to better understand the developer community and root out bad actors from gaming the system to propagate malicious apps. The development comes as Google is taking a series of steps to secure the Android ecosystem. Last November, it moved the App Defense Alliance (ADA), which it launched in November 2019, under the Linux Foundation umbrella, with Meta and Microsoft joining as the founding steering members. Around the same time, the company also rolled out real-time scanning at the code level to tackle novel Android malware and an ""Independent security review"" badge in the Play Store's Data safety section for VPN apps that have undergone a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) audit. On the user-facing side of things, Google has also taken the step of taking down approximately 1.5 million applications from the Play Store that do not target the most recent APIs. Google's ongoing fight to tackle malicious actors on Android coincides with a lawsuit filed by the company in the U.S. against two China-based fraudsters who are alleged to have engaged in an international online consumer investment fraud scheme and tricked users into downloading fake apps from the Play Store and other sources and ultimately stealing their funds.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_DasP12b7drEpQERA4AwBEHeIyvjyMXKnSwdhjuvKpUdqmuVxtwOunO82C6W6Qycj8LrexG63f9f5pXOdh13c9RAeLEERsZXgWYJkwnmeS1xdtdUaiOCCK9APZghrApgreOPCjlEUToF5FqRV3l7tFXj-LPQ9DwKjo3Szj1n4NY8G6gOkAkzBt_LS6faA/s728-rw-e365/play.png,2024-04-29,-0.479,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mountain View', 'latitude': 37.386051177978516, 'longitude': -122.08384704589844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ADA', 'latitude': 39.151390075683594, 'longitude': -97.88921356201172, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meta', 'latitude': 57.93082809448242, 'longitude': 16.775279998779297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Data', 'latitude': 23.614999771118164, 'longitude': 103.33833312988281, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'APIs', 'latitude': 34.83332824707031, 'longitude': 32.383331298828125, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'China', 'latitude': 35.0, 'longitude': 105.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",I don t know,"Google Play Store rejected or remediated 200,000 apps for sensitive data access issues and blocked 333,000 bad accounts for malware or policy violations in 2023."

Now might be a good time to take it in because it seems to be vanishing. According to 9to5Google, the number of animals that will give you AR renders when you search for them has shriveled to just a few. My editor, Richard Lawler, saw the same thing on his Pixel 8 Pro, as did I when I checked my Pixel 6. But when I searched in Safari on my iPhone 15 Pro, there they were: Tyrannosaurus Rex, Spinosaurus, Rhinoceros Beetle, Jewel Beetle, and a Giant Panda! Perhaps it’s just a bug? Or perhaps Safari is a temporary workaround.

Earlier this year, Google jettisoned hundreds of AR hardware employees. The company also lost key leaders of its AR team last year and reportedly shuttered its Project Iris AR glasses in June. When it rolled out in early 2020, Google’s AR search feature was a boon for some folks stuck in covid lockdown — particularly those of us with children to entertain. It started with animals like tigers, alligators, and mallard ducks, but Google steadily added more creatures, including dinosaurs and bugs. Eventually, the collection grew to include NASA artifacts and fictional characters like Pac-Man, Hello Kitty, and even Pedro Pascal’s son, Baby Yoda. We asked Google to explain what’s happening, but it didn’t give us an answer by press time. We’ll update if that changes. In the meantime, maybe now is a good time to go look at some AR animals — if they’re still showing up for you.

Prioritize downtime Being busy doesn’t necessarily equal being productive. Downtime allows your brain to rest and refresh, enabling you to return to tasks with renewed energy and focus. “Uptime in computers is any time a machine is on, operational and productive. I define it the same in our world. Finding your uptime is that feeling of being in the flow, on top of things, productive and well,” Laura says. “And just like your computer needs to shut down and reboot to avoid burnout, you need the same. Without breaks to relax and process information and ideas, we cannot sustain uptime.” Plus, downtime is often the best time for creativity. “Your greatest ideas are more likely to come to you while on a walk or cooking dinner than during your 10th meeting of the day,” Laura says. “You have to allow for downtime in your schedule to fuel your own propensity for big-picture thinking and inspiration.” 5. Plan for “Future You” Sometimes we fail to consider how our present-day decisions may affect our future selves. For example, you might schedule six meetings back-to-back on the day you’ll return from vacation without envisioning how that future version of you will feel. “Instead of planning for who we are now, we want to be constantly planning for our future self,” Laura says. “What will Future You wish you had scheduled — or not scheduled — after that four-hour meeting block next week?

Google Gemini: Everything you need to know about the new generative AI platform - TechCrunch,Google Gemini: Everything you need to know about the new generative AI platform  TechCrunch,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 23:29:21 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNC8yOS93aGF0LWlzLWdvb2dsZS1nZW1pbmktYWkv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA0LzI5L3doYXQtaXMtZ29vZ2xlLWdlbWluaS1haS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,TechCrunch,"Google’s trying to make waves with Gemini, its flagship suite of generative AI models, apps and services. So what is Gemini? How can you use it? And how does it stack up to the competition? To make it easier to keep up with the latest Gemini developments, we’ve put together this handy guide, which we’ll keep updated as new Gemini models, features and news about Google’s plans for Gemini are released. What is Gemini? Gemini is Google’s long-promised, next-gen GenAI model family, developed by Google’s AI research labs DeepMind and Google Research. It comes in three flavors: Gemini Ultra, the most performant Gemini model. Gemini Pro, a “lite” Gemini model. Gemini Nano, a smaller “distilled” model that runs on mobile devices like the Pixel 8 Pro. All Gemini models were trained to be “natively multimodal” — in other words, able to work with and use more than just words. They were pretrained and fine-tuned on a variety of audio, images and videos, a large set of codebases and text in different languages. This sets Gemini apart from models such as Google’s own LaMDA, which was trained exclusively on text data. LaMDA can’t understand or generate anything other than text (e.g., essays, email drafts), but that isn’t the case with Gemini models. What’s the difference between the Gemini apps and Gemini models? Google, proving once again that it lacks a knack for branding, didn’t make it clear from the outset that Gemini is separate and distinct from the Gemini apps on the web and mobile (formerly Bard). The Gemini apps are simply an interface through which certain Gemini models can be accessed — think of it as a client for Google’s GenAI. Incidentally, the Gemini apps and models are also totally independent from Imagen 2, Google’s text-to-image model that’s available in some of the company’s dev tools and environments. What can Gemini do? Because the Gemini models are multimodal, they can in theory perform a range of multimodal tasks, from transcribing speech to captioning images and videos to generating artwork. Some of these capabilities have reached the product stage yet (more on that later), and Google’s promising all of them — and more — at some point in the not-too-distant future. Of course, it’s a bit hard to take the company at its word. Google seriously underdelivered with the original Bard launch. And more recently it ruffled feathers with a video purporting to show Gemini’s capabilities that turned out to have been heavily doctored and was more or less aspirational. Still, assuming Google is being more or less truthful with its claims, here’s what the different tiers of Gemini will be able to do once they reach their full potential: Gemini Ultra Google says that Gemini Ultra — thanks to its multimodality — can be used to help with things like physics homework, solving problems step-by-step on a worksheet and pointing out possible mistakes in already filled-in answers. Gemini Ultra can also be applied to tasks such as identifying scientific papers relevant to a particular problem, Google says — extracting information from those papers and “updating” a chart from one by generating the formulas necessary to re-create the chart with more recent data. Gemini Ultra technically supports image generation, as alluded to earlier. But that capability hasn’t made its way into the productized version of the model yet — perhaps because the mechanism is more complex than how apps such as ChatGPT generate images. Rather than feed prompts to an image generator (like DALL-E 3, in ChatGPT’s case), Gemini outputs images “natively,” without an intermediary step. Gemini Ultra is available as an API through Vertex AI, Google’s fully managed AI developer platform, and AI Studio, Google’s web-based tool for app and platform developers. It also powers the Gemini apps — but not for free. Access to Gemini Ultra through what Google calls Gemini Advanced requires subscribing to the Google One AI Premium Plan, priced at $20 per month. The AI Premium Plan also connects Gemini to your wider Google Workspace account — think emails in Gmail, documents in Docs, presentations in Sheets and Google Meet recordings. That’s useful for, say, summarizing emails or having Gemini capture notes during a video call. Gemini Pro Google says that Gemini Pro is an improvement over LaMDA in its reasoning, planning and understanding capabilities. An independent study by Carnegie Mellon and BerriAI researchers found that the initial version of Gemini Pro was indeed better than OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 at handling longer and more complex reasoning chains. But the study also found that, like all large language models, this version of Gemini Pro particularly struggled with mathematics problems involving several digits, and users found examples of bad reasoning and obvious mistakes. Google promised remedies, though — and the first arrived in the form of Gemini 1.5 Pro. Designed to be a drop-in replacement, Gemini 1.5 Pro is improved in a number of areas compared with its predecessor, perhaps most significantly in the amount of data that it can process. Gemini 1.5 Pro can take in ~700,000 words, or ~30,000 lines of code — 35x the amount Gemini 1.0 Pro can handle. And — the model being multimodal — it’s not limited to text. Gemini 1.5 Pro can analyze up to 11 hours of audio or an hour of video in a variety of different languages, albeit slowly (e.g., searching for a scene in a one-hour video takes 30 seconds to a minute of processing). Gemini 1.5 Pro entered public preview on Vertex AI in April. An additional endpoint, Gemini Pro Vision, can process text and imagery — including photos and video — and output text along the lines of OpenAI’s GPT-4 with Vision model. Within Vertex AI, developers can customize Gemini Pro to specific contexts and use cases using a fine-tuning or “grounding” process. Gemini Pro can also be connected to external, third-party APIs to perform particular actions. In AI Studio, there’s workflows for creating structured chat prompts using Gemini Pro. Developers have access to both Gemini Pro and the Gemini Pro Vision endpoints, and they can adjust the model temperature to control the output’s creative range and provide examples to give tone and style instructions — and also tune the safety settings. Once Gemini 1.5 Pro exits preview in Vertex, however, the model will cost $0.0025 per character while output will cost $0.00005 per character. Vertex customers pay per 1,000 characters (about 140 to 250 words) and, in the case of models like Gemini Pro Vision, per image ($0.0025). Let’s assume a 500-word article contains 2,000 characters. Summarizing that article with Gemini 1.5 Pro would cost $5. Meanwhile, generating an article of a similar length would cost $0.1. Ultra pricing has yet to be announced.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/google-bard-gemini-v2.jpg?w=680,2024-04-29,-0.077,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'DeepMind', 'description': 'Artificial intelligence company owned by Google', 'full_name': 'DeepMind', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/DeepMind_logo.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gemini', 'latitude': 39.95328140258789, 'longitude': -112.1243896484375, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gen', 'latitude': 8.194169998168945, 'longitude': -7.110829830169678, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pixel', 'latitude': 51.895450592041016, 'longitude': 8.27793025970459, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MDA', 'latitude': 58.43190002441406, 'longitude': 27.79281997680664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bard', 'latitude': 36.07450866699219, 'longitude': -90.3770523071289, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chat', 'latitude': 31.01589012145996, 'longitude': 50.022979736328125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DALL', 'latitude': 6.967780113220215, 'longitude': 44.51472091674805, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'API', 'latitude': 3.650369882583618, 'longitude': 25.327869415283203, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Berri', 'latitude': 47.0, 'longitude': 2.0, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Open', 'latitude': -8.142800331115723, 'longitude': 112.83219909667969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pro', 'latitude': 15.960000038146973, 'longitude': 106.86315155029297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Vision', 'latitude': 45.53900146484375, 'longitude': -94.9320068359375, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'APIs', 'latitude': 34.83332824707031, 'longitude': 32.383331298828125, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ultra', 'latitude': 63.283329010009766, 'longitude': 19.083330154418945, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Google's Gemini, a suite of generative AI models, apps, and services, includes Gemini Ultra, Pro, and Nano.

Google Issues 'Critical' Chrome Update For All Windows Users - Forbes,Google Issues 'Critical' Chrome Update For All Windows Users  Forbes,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 07:03:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvemFrZG9mZm1hbi8yMDI0LzA0LzI5L25ldy1nb29nbGUtY2hyb21lLXdhcm5pbmctbWljcm9zb2Z0LXdpbmRvd3MtMTAtd2luZG93cy0xMS11cGdyYWRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Forbes,"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin If you are a Windows user with Chrome installed on your PC, then this latest warning will impact you—it’s critical you update your browser as soon as you can… Another critical Chrome update has just been issued NurPhoto via Getty Images Updated 04/29; originally published 04/26. Another Chrome security update has just been issued, with the Stable channel updated to 124.0.6367.78/.79. This release includes a critical fix to the underlying graphics engine of the type that has allowed attackers to execute code on target machines in the past—albeit no news yet as to any exploitation this time around. The update also includes two high-severity memory fixes—the kind typically seen in such updates. Google has acknowledged that such memory vulnerabilities in its core engine are the most frequently discovered and exploited. As usual, there is no further information “until a majority of users are updated with a fix.” Given that Google has designated the first fix—essentially a vulnerability to potential code manipulation—as critical, it seems highly likely it’s a credible threat. And once the fix becomes public, it’s important that users update as soon as they can—the clock is ticking for any exploitation.

The other news is that the death of Chrome’s dreaded tracking cookies has been delayed once again—this time into early 2025, at least. The issue is Google’s need to balance the privacy of its users with the seemingly fair treatment of its advertisers, especially when it essentially plays both gamekeeper (as owner of the browser) and poacher (as the world’s largest ad machine). “We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers,” Google said in a post mid-week, “and will continue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem.” That’s a critical update of an entirely different kind. The update comes as Google’s ongoing engagement with the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) tries to carve a path through this messy situation. “We will not complete third-party cookie deprecation during the second half of Q4,” Google confirmed. “Assuming we can reach an agreement, we envision proceeding with third-party cookie deprecation starting early next year.” Google is in something of a bind here, given its unique role in the industry. As web users become ever more privacy savvy, the gap between where Chrome is today and Apple’s Safari remains too wide. Chrome is an excellent browser, and its users rightly want to see it line up more closely with the alternatives. Google seems to agree—notwithstanding its awkward Incognito Mode stumble—but it needs to find a compromise that doesn’t kill its ad model as well as those cookies. Meanwhile, the bigger open question is around AI, of course, and just what this will mean for browser searching and advertising in the coming years. All told, by the time these cookies finally disappear, we may be in new territory anyway. MORE FROM FORBESWhy You Should Change How You Make Calls On Your iPhoneBy Zak Doffman 04/29 update: To be fair to Google, Chrome’s regular security updates—whether addressing vulnerabilities discovered by external researchers or by Google itself, front-end an ongoing program to improve the security of the world’s most popular browser. As a recent example, the forthcoming Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) update should materially resolve the plague of session cookie theft, “by binding authentication sessions to the device... to disrupt the cookie theft industry since exfiltrating these cookies will no longer have any value.” But these security advances are not always smooth running—and another such update, Chrome’s foray into post-quantum cryptography (PQC), seems to have hit a teething issue. Put at its simplest, PQC aims to protect today’s data from tomorrow’s more advanced threats—the theory being that while today’s defenses are largely good enough, new quantum computing advances will likely break the best cryptography available today. And while Google points out that “it’s believed that quantum computers that can break modern classical cryptography won’t arrive for 5, 10, possibly even 50 years from now,” the issue is the threat from “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later, in which data is collected and stored today and later decrypted once cryptanalysis improves.” Google says that “the sooner we can update TLS to use quantum-resistant session keys, the sooner we can protect user network traffic against future quantum cryptanalysis,” and that “we are updating technical standards, testing and deploying new quantum-resistant algorithms, and working with the broader ecosystem to help ensure this effort is a success.” But as Bleeping Computer reported over the weekend, “some ​Google Chrome users report having issues connecting to websites, servers, and firewalls after Chrome 124 was released last week with the new quantum-resistant X25519Kyber768 encapsulation mechanism enabled by default... The issue also affects security appliances, firewalls, networking middleware, and various network devices from multiple vendors (e.g., Fortinet, SonicWall, Palo Alto Networks, AWS).” For now, “affected Google Chrome users can mitigate the issue by going to chrome://flags/#enable-tls13-kyber and disabling the TLS 1.3 hybridized Kyber support in Chrome,” but the option to disable PQC defenses will be removed once the technology is considered stable. PQC hit the headlines earlier this year, with Apple’s announcement that it was updating iMessage to protect against the same threat. And while Apple presented this as a competitive advantage for iMessage over alternatives, the reality is that such technology is likely to become much more standard over the next few years. But such tech is still fairly deep inside the rabbit hole, and you can expect many more unexpected issues as wider rollouts begin. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The data center planned for Fort Wayne was announced in January. But Google disclosed the project's cost Friday and said it is expected to create up to new 200 jobs, including data center technicians and support services, The Journal Gazette reported. The data center in the city about 120 miles (190 kilometers) northeast of Indianapolis will help power Google's “AI innovations and growing Google Cloud business for customers across the world,” Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office said in a news release. Google said the new data center will join a network of Google-owned-and-operated data centers across the globe that “keep the internet humming"" and power digital services such as Google Cloud, Gmail, Search and Maps. “Together, Fort Wayne and Google will help power the digital future, including AI innovation across our enterprise and consumer services,” said Joe Kava, Google's vice president of data centers. Friday's announcement came one day after Amazon’s cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services said it plans to invest $11 billion to build a data center in northern Indiana near the town of New Carlisle, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of South Bend.

Cece Meadows, the founder and CEO of Prados Beauty, initially turned to Google to learn about using digital tools to amplify her brand. Now she’s using Gemini to save time on everyday tasks and brainstorm ideas to grow her business. Cece launched Prados Beauty from her daughter's nursery in 2019, and later relocated to Las Cruces, New Mexico with her husband Daniel, a U.S. Army major. When she started using Google Ads in 2020, Cece noticed a return on ad spend within two months, seeing a 500% year-over-year increase in web traffic and a 700% jump in sales. “We realized the importance of having Google Ads running daily,” says Cece. A few years later, Cece participated in a Grow with Google event where she first learned about AI tools, specifically Gemini. “I thought this could help my business in a big, big way,” says Cece. Today, she uses Gemini to help her write social media posts, brainstorm packaging ideas and learn about aspects of building a brand. “Something that would take me all day or even two days to do, I can do it in an hour,” she says. “It’s very helpful for me and my business.” Like Cece, small business owners can take advantage of AI training and resources like Google AI Essentials — a self-paced course designed to help people across roles and industries learn AI skills to boost their productivity. They can also attend the U.S. Small Business Administration’s National Small Business Week Virtual Summit from April 30 - May 1.

"Fears over AI killing labor demand are 'probably overblown,' researcher argues in new Google report - Fortune","Fears over AI killing labor demand are 'probably overblown,' researcher argues in new Google report  Fortune","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 23:24:46 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNC8yOS9mZWFycy1haS1raWxsaW5nLWxhYm9yLWRlbWFuZC1vdmVyYmxvd24tZ29vZ2xlLXJlcG9ydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fortune,"Andrew McAfee, the inaugural visiting fellow for technology and society at Google and a principal research scientist at MIT, discusses the concept in a report, “Generally Faster: The economic impact of Generative AI,” released on April 25 by Google. It’s based on his research on AI, which he says can positively transform economies and societies. I first met McAfee in November at a Fortune CFO Collaborative dinner, held in collaboration with our founding partner Workday and sponsor Deloitte, where he talked about generative AI. “This stuff is going to diffuse throughout the economy,” he told the audience of CFOs. “It’s going to separate winners from losers, and it’s going to turbocharge the winners faster than you and I have been expecting based on the past 25 years of technology.” His advice to them? “Risk tolerance needs to shift. Not being agile is a deep, deep risk.” In his new report, McAfee explores the implications of generative AI in economic growth, looking at everything from its possible effects on job skills and wages to how it may transform entires industries to its potential risks and pitfalls. “Previous general-purpose technologies have taken decades to boost entire economies,” McAfee writes. “The electric motor, for example, was patented in the U.S. in 1837 and Edison’s first power station began operating in 1881. However, electrification only began to have a significant positive effect on American factories’ productivity in the 1920s. Change was slow because these technologies diffused slowly, often requiring new infrastructure such as roads and electrical transmission networks.” But when it comes to generative AI, most of the required infrastructure already exists. “Once new generative AI systems are developed,” he writes, “they can be deployed around the world as quickly as web pages and apps can.” Goldman Sachs Research forecasts AI will start having a measurable impact on U.S. GDP in 2027, with other nations feeling those effects in subsequent years. AI could ultimately automate around 25% of labor tasks in advanced economies and 10% to 20% of work in emerging economies, according to the firm’s economists. But fears over such a steep drop in labor demand are “probably overblown,” McAfee writes. “The history of general-purpose technologies shows that the growth they bring is accompanied by strong demand for labor.” This is reflected in number of new jobs created: Over 85% of total U.S. employment growth since 1940 has come in entirely new occupations. Generative AI is already delivering large productivity gains, and while it will reduce demand for some skills, it also will increase demand for others and, McAfee notes, it will create demand for entirely new ones. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com María Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today’s newsletter. Leaderboard Craig Felenstein will assume the role CFO at the sports data and technology company Sportradar (Nasdaq: SRAD) on June 1. Most recently, Felenstein served as CFO at Lindblad Expeditions.He previously held various management roles at Discovery Communications before taking over as SVP of investor relations and strategic finance at Shutterstock. Thomas Timko was appointed as CFO at Diebold Nixdorf (NYSE: DBD) effective May 17, succeeding current CFO Jim Barna. Timko has served as chief accounting officer and controller at General Motors, GE, and Delphi Corporation. He was also chief accounting officer at Applied Materials. Big deal Thomson Reuters Institute's 2024 generative AI in professional services report gauges the perceptions and usage of the technology in the workplace. A key finding is that many of the executives surveyed think the use cases for generative AI are not only evident but more than half (54%) said they believe the technology should be applied to their work, while just 16% said it should not. Corporate legal departments, corporate risk departments, and corporate tax departments each topped at least 60% of respondents answering yes. Government law agencies and courts were more skeptical—just 40% and 47% respectively, answered affirmatively that generative AI should be applied to their work. With more than a year since ChatGPT's public introduction and the beginnings of this research, many different types of professional services organizations have already begun to explore generative AI use cases, evaluate and test tools, according to the report. The most successful companies will be the ones that use generative AI to augment, not fully replace, what professionals do, the report states. The findings are based on a survey of 1,128 professionals in legal, tax and accounting, risk and fraud, and government. Courtesy of Thomson Reuters Institute Going deeper AICPA & CIMA have released their “Re-defining finance for a sustainable world” white paper, the latest iteration of their Future of Finance research program. It highlights that accounting and finance are moving away from traditional rules-based approaches and toward a more inclusive, expansive, and value-creation mindset. Sixty percent of accounting and finance professionals surveyed say they identify as finance business partners, and 84% of those are optimistic about the future of the profession. In comparison, of the 40% who say they don't identify as finance business partners, just 15% say they are optimistic about the future of the profession. However, when it comes to automation, 92% of respondents in non-business partnering roles fear being automated out of existence compared to 67% of those in business partnering roles.

Here’s how it works. Pro Security Google Chrome's new post-quantum cryptography is causing some issues News By Craig Hale published 29 April 2024 Chrome 124 not working? Try this Image credit: Shutterstock (Image credit: Shutterstock) Some Google Chrome users are reporting problems connecting to websites, servers and firewalls following the release of Chrome 124 earlier this month, according to Bleeping Computer. Released in April 2024, the latest version of the browser introduced the new quantum-resistant X25519Kyber768 encapsulation mechanism, which was enabled by default. Testing of the post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism started in August 2023, but since its public launch, has already caused a headache for the browser’s users. Quantum-resistant cryptography is breaking Chrome for some users An email sent on behalf of Chrome’s security workers explains the necessity behind implementing quantum-resistant tools now, despite the current threat being minimal: “This protects users’ traffic from so-called “store now decrypt later” attacks, in which a future quantum computer could decrypt encrypted traffic recorded today.” A separate blog post confirms the nature of the advanced tool: “This is a hybrid X25519 and Kyber768 key agreement based on an IETF standard.” Despite months of testing, the problem seems to have risen from web servers failing to adequately implement TLS, rather than an issue with Chrome. The error results in the rejection of connections that use the Kyber768 quantum-resistant key agreement algorithm, including connections with Chrome’s hybrid key. Are you a pro?

Clearly, this is not a simple fix that can be implemented by Chrome, but it requires a larger and more orchestrated effort to transform the Internet into one that can handle sophisticated quantum-safe cryptography. For now, affected users are being advised to disable the TLS 1.3 hybridized Kyber support in Chrome. However, long-term post-quantum secure ciphers will be essential in TLS, and the ability to disable the feature will likely be removed in the future, highlighting the importance of addressing the issue’s route cause earlier on so that websites can be prepared for quantum-based attacks in the future.

In the age of AI advancements, encountering posts like this has become a nightmare for corporate employees. And, now, amid reports that Alphabet-owned Google has chosen to terminate its entire Python team, shockwaves have rippled through the tech community and LinkedIn is buzzing with comments. A recent social media post by former Google employee Matt Hu has everyone questioning their future.Ex-Google employee shares layoff experienceThe ex-employee who had been working for Google for the past two years, recounted the moment they learned their fate, revealing the raw emotions and sense of shock that accompany such sudden job loss. Matt Hu described himself as a software engineer who came from China holding an H-1B visa. As per Hu, the moment he saw his ‘Cloutop StopInstance operation’ starting on his company’s laptop he dealt with “the longest five minutes” in his life figuring out if what he was thinking was right or not.Also read: Columbia Uni stands firm on Israel ties: Won't divest, sets deadline for protesters‘My hands were shaking’Hu, revealed he was having a good time with his girlfriend having dinner and watching a movie before the ‘no notice’ layoff rocked his world. “I went downstairs and opened up my laptop. That was 21:00. I got a weird email saying 'Your Cloudtop StopInstance operation has begun',” he wrote on his LinkedIn post.“I suddenly recalled I just had the cloudtop maintenance a few days back, it couldn't be a scheduled task, there was definitely something bad happening. I even 'Momaed' (Google's internal search engine) 'what stopinstance means' and I did get the results from the website, so I chose not to believe I was leaving the company,” the post further read.Also read: Meghan Markle’s shocking Nigerian roots revealed as she ditches Prince Harry for UK tripAccording to him, within seconds, he lost access to multiple sites, and his laptop 'went into a straight reboot,' followed shortly by an email about his employment status that made it clear what was happening.

I replied to the email instantly, and suddenly the whole team showed up, people were around at night, surprised by this sudden but devastating change.

As spotted by @howfxr on Twitter/X, Google has added a new AI experience to Search called “speaking practice.” The feature allows users to improve their English skills. It’s not directly meant for teaching the language, it seems, but rather to help users improve their skills bit-by-bit. Google explains: Improve your English with the help of Google Search. Interactive experiences powered by generative AI help you use new words in everyday scenarios with examples. Try it now, or find it the next time that you translate on Search. After enabling Search Labs, click on Try an example. The activity can also be found by translating to or from English on Google Search using an Android device. The page also says the feature is available in certain countries. Google confirmed to TechCrunch that “speaking practice” is available in Argentina, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Venezuela, a couple more than the page itself had mentioned. However, users must enroll in Search Labs to access and turn on “speaking practice.” In late 2023, Google introduced a similar tool for helping English learners to practice speaking.

Google also sometimes brings a surprise device announcement to the party, but we wouldn’t bet on a new flagship smartwatch considering the Google Pixel Watch 2 was only released in October. If you’re a Pixel fan looking to upgrade, the flagship Wear OS smartwatch is matching the lowest price we’ve seen with Amazon, Best Buy, and Google taking it down to $299.99 ($50 off). The Pixel Watch 2 is our favorite smartwatch for Fitbit fans, easily taking the crown from its predecessor by adding even more Fitbit-powered health features and Google apps. You’ll get automatic workout tracking, Google apps like Calendar and Gmail, and access to thousands of apps with Wear OS support available at Google Play. With luck, we’ll hear about new Wear OS developments and features at the aforementioned developers conference, even though the newest version is still making its way to supported devices nearly a year after it was announced. (All the more reason to go for a Pixel device if fast updates are important to you.) It’s also just a great smartwatch overall, mostly thanks to better battery life that can last all day and that charges up to 50 percent capacity in about 30 minutes. What’s also great is that you don’t need to own a Google Pixel phone to get the most from the smartwatch. Unlike Samsung’s watches, which require a Samsung phone to use the best features, most Pixel Watch 2 features are available to all Android users. That’s why the Wear OS 4 wearable is also our top Android smartwatch for non-Samsung users. Read our Google Pixel Watch 2 review.

Now until May 10th, you can save 18 percent on a three-month subscription, bringing it down to $36.99 ($8 off). There’s also a one-month subscription that’s down to $12.99 ($3 off).

Game Pass Ultimate features hundreds of games that rotate monthly, including day-one first-party titles from Microsoft’s studios, a large selection of EA games and trials, indies, and AAA classics. * Right now, you can get Amazon’s latest Echo Dot smart speaker, which has some good sound for such a tiny device, for just $27.99 ($22 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which is only $5 more than the all-time low. The fifth-gen Dot is as versatile as the prior model but features better sound and a new temperature sensor that can trigger Alexa Routines. It also doubles as a Wi-Fi extender for Amazon’s Eero Wi-Fi routers. The LED-equipped model with its ever-present clock is also on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $39.99 ($20 off), another great price since it’s only been $5 cheaper in prior sales. * Belkin’s second-gen 3-in-1 MagSafe charging stand can hold and charge all your ultra-portable Apple devices, and it’s down to $109.99 ($40 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, only $9 more than the best price we’ve seen. It’s our favorite 3-in-1 MagSafe stand as it bears two magnetic arms to hold your MagSafe-equipped iPhone and Apple Watch, the former charging at 15W speeds and the latter supporting fast charging on the Apple Watch Series 7 and newer. Those devices hover over a third charging contact in the base (which is where your AirPods or other wireless charging earbuds can go).",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3lSgPuYp1vD_XOZVJBaU83v7vnI=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24992625/236828_Pixel_Watch_2_AKrales_0705.jpg,2024-04-29,0.086,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chrome', 'latitude': 39.73344039916992, 'longitude': -75.98245239257812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pixel', 'latitude': 51.895450592041016, 'longitude': 8.27793025970459, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wear', 'latitude': -5.497220039367676, 'longitude': 133.04249572753906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Amazon', 'latitude': 46.32020950317383, 'longitude': -112.10722351074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Best Buy', 'latitude': 43.12942886352539, 'longitude': -89.2989730834961, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Calendar', 'latitude': 45.62406921386719, 'longitude': -115.66985321044922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Samsung', 'latitude': 36.39739990234375, 'longitude': 127.7323989868164, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Xbox', 'latitude': 20.204750061035156, 'longitude': -89.00511932373047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Target', 'latitude': 46.29029846191406, 'longitude': 3.0622000694274902, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dot', 'latitude': 36.67778015136719, 'longitude': -86.95249938964844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Alexa', 'latitude': 54.67409896850586, 'longitude': 25.285200119018555, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'LED', 'latitude': 59.16667175292969, 'longitude': 15.466670036315918, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Belkin', 'latitude': 45.22999954223633, 'longitude': 148.3800048828125, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 39.40283966064453, 'longitude': -82.70710754394531, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Google I/O is approaching, potentially bringing new software features for Android, Chrome, and Search.

However, Google denied that the layoffs were company-wide when asked about the fate of the team. Reports of the Python team’s dismissal have shown up in Reddit, Hacker News, and social.coop. “Google’s Python team was a small team, most of which were also on the Python steering council or core Python developers,” one commenter said in Hacker News. “These people had decades of experience in Python. Their knowledge and community connections [are] irreplaceable.” Python has become an increasingly popular programming language in recent years, with AI becoming a particularly critical usage. Google said the action taken was not a company-wide layoff, in response to an InfoWorld inquiry April 29. “We’re responsibly investing in our company’s biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead. To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities,” a Google spokesperson said. “Through this, we’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers.” The Google spokesperson emphasized that this was not a company-wide layoff.

His father, a Syrian immigrant, drove a taxi. His mother was a nurse with the National Health Service. When the prestigious Queen Elizabeth’s School accepted him at the age of 11, the family moved into a safer, leafier neighborhood a few miles north. There, he met 20-year-old Demis Hassabis, after becoming friends with his younger brother. Demis was a chess prodigy and video game designer whose parents — one a Greek Cypriot, the other a Singaporean — ran a London toy store. Today, they are two of the most powerful executives in the tech industry’s race to build artificial intelligence. Dr. Hassabis, 47, is the chief executive of Google DeepMind, the tech giant’s central research lab for artificial intelligence. Mr. Suleyman, 39, was recently named chief executive of Microsoft AI, charged with overseeing the company’s push into A.I. consumer products. Their path from London to the executive suites of Big Tech is one of the most unusual — and personal — stories in an industry full of colorful personalities and cutting rivalries. In 2010, they were two of the three founders of DeepMind, a seminal A.I. research lab that was supposed to prevent the very thing they are now deeply involved in: an escalating race by profit-driven companies to build and deploy A.I.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/business/00hassabis-suleyman/00hassabis-suleyman-facebookJumbo.jpg,2024-04-29,0.192,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'London', 'latitude': 51.50852966308594, 'longitude': -0.12574000656604767, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 42.950538635253906, 'longitude': -91.28929901123047, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Queen Elizabeth', 'latitude': 45.500301361083984, 'longitude': -73.568603515625, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'School', 'latitude': 45.150001525878906, 'longitude': 11.816670417785645, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Demis', 'latitude': 10.400030136108398, 'longitude': 44.34743881225586, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'A.I.', 'latitude': 36.32014083862305, 'longitude': -78.96167755126953, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tech', 'latitude': 20.950000762939453, 'longitude': -75.96666717529297, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",I don t know,"Mustafa Suleyman, now CEO of Microsoft AI, and Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, co-founded DeepMind in 2010.

Google Touts Programmatic Video Capabilities at NewFronts - Adweek,Google Touts Programmatic Video Capabilities at NewFronts  Adweek,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 18:22:05 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkd2Vlay5jb20vY29udmVyZ2VudC10di9nb29nbGUtcHJvZ3JhbW1hdGljLXZpZGVvLWNhcGFiaWxpdGllcy1kc3AtbmV3ZnJvbnRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Adweek,"Google used its NewFronts presentation today to tell buyers why they should be connecting to television with its DSP, Display & Video 360, a departure from previous years when the annual presentation to digital ad buyers focused on YouTube. “If you’re not already taking a unified approach to your streaming, think about the efficient reach you’re missing out on on all of your campaigns,” said Kristen O’Hara, vp of agency, platform and client solutions at Google. To prove its point, Google brought a bevy of executives on stage and cited numerous examples from companies, including Danone, SAP, NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and Albertson’s Media Collective. Mars Petcare shared how unifying all its streaming television buys on DV360 helped the company grow its reach by 12% and only reach each viewer two times, a notable stat that elicited impressed sounds from the audience, as a challenge in streaming television has been showing the same ads to audiences too many times. The company also announced tools to make it easier to access premium streaming inventory digitally, including expanding its instant deal tool, which allows buyers to run private auctions for publishers such as Disney. This tool was previously reserved for premium YouTube inventory only. Google said it will help buyers secure quality inventory and skip complex negotiations. The company is also rolling out a new tool called commitment optimizer to help brands manage their deals within DV360, which uses artificial intelligence to optimize the best mix of inventory across deal types. The tool can help buyers spend less time managing spreadsheets and allows more flexibility in media planning, said Clare Ritchie, svp and global head of programmatic and media in-housing at Omnicom Media Group, who helped develop the tool with Google. And finally, Google announced that it was open-sourcing its tech tool Publisher Advertiser Identity Reconciliation (PAIR). Industry standards body the IAB Tech Lab will help give every adtech firm access to the protocol, which helps advertisers and publishers share first-party data, particularly via clean rooms. All these moves come as adtech firms that once specialized in populating websites with banner ads are looking to command lucrative TV budgets. Over the past few years, major adtech firms like The Trade Desk, Magnite and PubMatic have all rolled out tools to help brands transact more streaming television spend programmatically. However, much of streaming television is still transacted via insertion orders, a manual buying process. Open-sourcing PAIR Google first announced PAIR in 2022. The tool allows publishers and advertisers to securely upload their encrypted data to use with a clean room. “PAIR is centered on a few key things: first-party data; advertiser and publisher control durability; and interoperability across the ads ecosystem,” O’Hara told ADWEEK in an exclusive interview about the partnership with IAB Tech Lab prior to the presentation. “In a nutshell, it’s going to help advertisers and publishers securely match their first-party data by encryption in a way that does not track users across the web.” At the NewFront presentation, NBCU chief data officer John Lee said PAIR can help the media company transmit data points like people logging into its NBC Sports app, theme park visitors and movie ticket buyers with the least amount of signal loss and filters. The IAB Tech Lab had been working on its own tech for helping brands and publishers share first-party data, called Open Private Join and Activation (OPJA). But now, the IAB Tech Lab is backing PAIR as the industrywide protocol for this task over OPJA, Shailley Singh, evp of product and COO at IAB Tech Lab, exclusively told ADWEEK. “We feel that PAIR protocol is better. It’s more scalable. It’s more elegant in design,” said Singh, who noted that the tech lab routinely adapts protocol given to the organization by other companies. While Google didn’t mention its Chrome browser’s delayed deprecation of third party cookies on stage, it noted how PAIR can be a privacy-first data targeting paradigm. “Privacy may not be front and center in CTV conversations today, but trust me, that will change,” said Adam Stewart, vp of sales at Google. “We actually have an amazing opportunity to get this right from day one. Because CTV has never used third-party cookies. We can start fresh instead of recreating outdated techniques.” AI-driven targeting No NewFronts presentation in 2024, especially one focused on demonstrating technical prowess, would be complete without an AI-driven product launch. Google announced the launch of a tool that will come out this summer that lets a marketer describe their intended customer base, and Google’s artificial intelligence will build matching audiences beyond who the marketer might have originally conceived. For example, a sneaker brand might not know that reaching people in the market for concert tickets could also lead to sales, explained Bill Reardon, general manager of enterprise platforms at Google Ads. Marketers still get to decide if they want to actually pay to target the segments suggested by the AI.",https://static-prod.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-newfront-buyers-dsp-2024-600x315.jpg,2024-04-29,0.149,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'John Lee', 'description': 'British Labour Party politician (1927-2020)', 'full_name': 'John Lee'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Video', 'latitude': 30.134170532226562, 'longitude': 122.76471710205078, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SAP', 'latitude': 53.58332824707031, 'longitude': 92.91667175292969, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Paramount', 'latitude': 33.889461517333984, 'longitude': -118.1597900390625, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Albertson', 'latitude': 40.77342987060547, 'longitude': -73.64318084716797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Disney', 'latitude': 36.4811897277832, 'longitude': -95.01496124267578, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Open', 'latitude': -8.142800331115723, 'longitude': 112.83219909667969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'PAIR', 'latitude': 50.44121170043945, 'longitude': 5.401659965515137, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NBC', 'latitude': 51.41672897338867, 'longitude': -0.03523999825119972, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'COO', 'latitude': 36.89332962036133, 'longitude': 27.288890838623047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Singh', 'latitude': 25.215839385986328, 'longitude': 68.55747985839844, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chrome', 'latitude': 39.73344039916992, 'longitude': -75.98245239257812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Google's NewFronts presentation emphasized the importance of unifying streaming television campaigns through its DSP, Display & Video 360.

For those who have not experienced the camera app on the Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro, it's chock full of AI goodness that powers the Best Take feature (which rarely fails to produce the best image from the camera). Another AI-centric feature finding its way to the Pixel 8a is Audio Magic Erasure, which does an outstanding job of eliminating background noise from videos you take with the camera. The built-in AI analyzes the audio from your footage, separates every sound into layers (such as cars, birds, dogs, and wind), and allows you to adjust the level of each layer. This means that if you want less sound from a barking dog, you can lower it. If you want to increase the sound of a babbling brook, you can do so as well.

This isn't Alphabet's first brush with the $2 trillion club. The company briefly hit the threshold in November 2021 and earlier this month but closed above it for the first time on Friday, according to Bloomberg. The news followed Alphabet's first-quarter earnings report on Thursday, where revenue beat analysts' expectations due to the success of Google's search engine. Alphabet's chief executive, Sundar Pichar, also highlighted the contributions of Google Cloud, which has been equipped with generative AI services through Google's AI model, Gemini.""In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past 8 months.

Most assume the tech giant's innovations will take the form of neural nets on the iPhone and other Apple devices. Small clues are popping up here and there hinting at what Apple is working on. Also: How Apple's AI advances could make or break the iPhone 16 Apple last week introduced OpenELM, an ""embedded"" large language model (LLM) that runs on mobile devices and essentially mashes together the breakthroughs of several research institutions, including Google's deep learning scholars and academics at Stanford and elsewhere. All of OpenELM's code is posted on GitHub, along with various documentation for its training approach. Apple has also detailed its work in a paper by Sachin Mehta and team, ""OpenELM: An Efficient Language Model Family with Open-source Training and Inference Framework"", posted on the arXiv pre-print server. Apple's researchers used a neural net with just 1.3 billion neural weights, or, parameters, suggesting the company is focusing on mobile devices. That number is far below the hundreds of billions of parameters used by models such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini. More parameters directly increases the amount of memory required -- a smaller neural net could fit into a mobile device more easily. OpenELM would be rather unremarkable without a key contribution: efficiency. The researchers adjust the layers of the deep neural network so that the AI model is more efficient than earlier models in how much data needs to be computed when training the neural network. Specifically, they can meet or beat the results of a slew of neural nets for mobile computing ""while requiring 2× fewer pre-training tokens"", where tokens are the individual characters, words, or sentence fragments in the training data. Also: 2024 may be the year AI learns in the palm of your hand Apple starts from the same approach as many LLMs: a transformer. The transformer is the signature neural net in language understanding, introduced by Google scientists in 2017. Every major language model since, including Google's BERT and OpenAI's GPT family of models, has adopted the transformer. Apple achieves high efficiency by melding the transformer with a technique introduced in 2021 by researchers at the University of Washington, Facebook AI Research, and the Allen Institute for AI, called DeLighT. That work broke away from the conventional approach in which all the neural weights are the same for every ""layer"" of the network, the successive mathematical computations through which the data passes. Instead, the researchers selectively adjusted each layer to have a different number of parameters. Because some layers have relatively few parameters, they called their approach a ""deep and light-weight transformer,"" hence the name, DeLighT. Also: Snowflake says its new LLM outperforms Meta's Llama 3 on half the training The researchers say that ""DeLighT matches or improves the performance of baseline Transformers with 2 to 3 times fewer parameters on average."" Using DeLighT, Apple created OpenELM, where each layer of the neural net has a distinct number of neural parameters, a non-uniform approach to parameters. ""Existing LLMs use the same configuration for each transformer layer in the model, resulting in a uniform allocation of parameters across layers,"" Mehta and his team wrote. ""Unlike these models, each transformer layer in OpenELM has a different configuration (e.g., number of heads and feed forward network dimension), resulting in variable number of parameters in each layer of the model."" The non-uniform approach, they write, ""lets OpenELM better utilize the available parameter budget for achieving higher accuracies."" Also: Yikes! Microsoft Copilot failed every single one of my coding tests The competition Apple measures itself against uses similarly small neural nets, such as MobiLlama from Mohamed bin Zayed University of AI and collaborating institutions, and OLMo, introduced in February 2024 by researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and scholars from the University of Washington, Yale University, New York University, and Carnegie Mellon University. Apple's experiments are not carried out on a mobile device. Instead, the company uses an Intel-based Ubuntu Linux workstation with a single Nvidia GPU. On numerous benchmark tests, OpenELM achieves better scores, despite being smaller and/or using fewer tokens. For example, on six out of seven tests, OpenELM beats OLMo despite having fewer parameters -- 1.08 billion versus 1.18 billion -- and only 1.5 trillion training tokens versus 3 trillion for OLMo. Also: How to avoid the headaches of AI skills development Although OpenELM can produce more accurate results more efficiently, the authors noted further research areas where OpenELM is slower in some cases at producing its predictions. Reports have suggested that Apple may license AI tech for iOS 18 integration from Google, OpenAI, or another leading AI company. Apple's investment in open-source software confers the intriguing possibility that the company might be trying to reinforce an open ecosystem from which its own devices can benefit.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/bd411dea93d80e9a6a3c66b99c7dae18f591a7bd/2024/04/29/01d205a8-62ad-4de7-ba98-dcf9530f44ea/gettyimages-1863293981.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-04-29,0.122,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Facebook', 'description': 'American social media and technology company', 'full_name': 'Meta Platforms', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Meta_Platforms_Headquarters_Menlo_Park_California.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 39.40283966064453, 'longitude': -82.70710754394531, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Open', 'latitude': -8.142800331115723, 'longitude': 112.83219909667969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'LLM', 'latitude': 52.11399841308594, 'longitude': -3.555000066757202, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Stanford', 'latitude': 37.424110412597656, 'longitude': -122.16607666015625, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gemini', 'latitude': 13.17300033569336, 'longitude': -59.63100051879883, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'BERT', 'latitude': 46.325599670410156, 'longitude': 3.7077999114990234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'University of Washington', 'latitude': 47.65610122680664, 'longitude': -122.310546875, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meta', 'latitude': 57.93082809448242, 'longitude': 16.775279998779297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Llama', 'latitude': 24.61471939086914, 'longitude': -106.81971740722656, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mehta', 'latitude': 33.0124397277832, 'longitude': 73.59799194335938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mohamed', 'latitude': 15.30720043182373, 'longitude': 7.54040002822876, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Zayed University'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'OLMo', 'latitude': 42.49530029296875, 'longitude': 9.407600402832031, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Yale University', 'latitude': 41.31121063232422, 'longitude': -72.9264907836914, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York University', 'latitude': 40.72871017456055, 'longitude': -73.9959716796875, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Carnegie Mellon University', 'latitude': 40.44118118286133, 'longitude': -79.94283294677734, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Intel', 'latitude': 37.38793182373047, 'longitude': -121.96353912353516, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nvidia', 'latitude': 37.370731353759766, 'longitude': -121.96373748779297, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",I don t know,Not-related content.

Now, the corporation is lashing out at any worker that was physically in the vicinity of the protest, including those who were not at all involved in the campaign,” it argued. A Google spokesperson said that the company was careful to confirm and double-check that “every single one of those whose employment was terminated was personally and definitively involved in disruptive activity inside our buildings.”No Tech for Apartheid stated that they would not stop organizing protests against the Nimbus contract, which aims to establish cloud-based data centers in a project to move much of the Israeli government’s IT infrastructure to cloud-based servers.Google has previously said that “these protests were part of a longstanding campaign by a group of organizations and people who largely don’t work at Google.”No Tech for Apartheid has been organizing demonstrations against Google and Amazon since they won the Nimbus bid in 2021. Employees had issued a public letter against the project, and at a 2022 Alphabet stockholders meeting, a proposal to reexamine involvement with Nimbus was rejected.In March, then-Google employee Eddie Hatfield was fired after interrupting Google Israel CEO Barak Regev at a New York City Israeli technology conference.","https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/592877",2024-04-29,-0.443,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Alphabet', 'description': 'American holding company and parent company of Google', 'full_name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Googleplex_HQ_%28cropped%29.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Israel', 'latitude': 31.5, 'longitude': 34.75, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'tID', 'latitude': 7.493150234222412, 'longitude': 29.026500701904297, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'BODY', 'latitude': 18.5, 'longitude': -73.53333282470703, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'York', 'latitude': 44.0513916015625, 'longitude': -79.48027801513672, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chelsea', 'latitude': 42.24959182739258, 'longitude': -121.79833984375, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tech', 'latitude': 20.950000762939453, 'longitude': -75.96666717529297, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sunnyvale', 'latitude': 37.368831634521484, 'longitude': -122.03634643554688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'REUTERS', 'latitude': 50.67449951171875, 'longitude': 9.351499557495117, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nimbus', 'latitude': 38.62907028198242, 'longitude': -121.2152328491211, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Amazon', 'latitude': 46.32020950317383, 'longitude': -112.10722351074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,Not-related content

But long before Facebook’s pivot, Google attempted its own foray into a nascent metaverse. In 2003… … Linden Lab launched Second Life, a virtual platform where people around the world created avatars to interact online. Users could explore highly customizable worlds and experiences, and even buy virtual items or content using in-world currency. Anshe Chung became the first person to earn $1m+ selling virtual real estate on the platform. By 2007, Second Life claimed it had 2m “residents,” though CNET estimated its active user base was likely closer to 200k-230k. Wanting a piece of the pie… … Google Labs launched its own social platform in 2008. Known as Lively, users chatted in virtual rooms via text bubbles that appeared over their avatars’ heads. (See a video here.) Users could decorate chatrooms with digital furniture, art, and YouTube videos — but unlike Second Life, Lively had no in-game currency or user-generated content, nor did it allow adult content. So what happened? Though promising as an accessible world that people could access right in their web browsers, there wasn’t much to do aside from chat with whatever strangers you could find in a given room. It also didn’t seem lucrative for Google. It didn’t appeal to advertisers, and while Google may have eventually installed a digital economy, the Great Recession meant people began cutting back on discretionary spending. Five months after launch, Google reported that Lively only had 10k weekly active users and would be shutting down. Today… … you’ll still find people dwelling in Second Life, but getting people to adopt virtual worlds has generally been tough. Meta’s Horizon Worlds has struggled to attract regular users, as has Decentraland. So far, it’s the gaming platforms — like “Minecraft” and “Fortnite” — that have seen wild success. Perhaps it’s better when players have clear objectives and tasks, versus wandering around trying to make a friend.

Ruth Porat, the president, chief investment officer and chief financial officer of Google and its parent company, Alphabet, announced the funds on Friday (April 26) at the company’s Reston headquarters. They will bring Google’s total investment in the state to more than $4.2 billion to date. “We’ve been here for five years with two data centers, and today, I’m really proud to announce that we’re investing an additional billion dollars in Virginia to expand those campuses and to add a third data center in Prince William County,” she said. Google also introduced a $75 million artificial intelligence opportunity fund and an AI essentials class as part of two new workforce development initiatives geared towards helping employees and learners in Virginia benefit from new technologies. “The intent is to ensure that everyone everywhere across Virginia and across the United States has the ability to get central training around AI,” Porat said. “How can we individually use it? How can we use it to support our businesses large and small?” Through providing grants to best-in-class workforce development and education organizations, Google’s opportunity fund will equip more than a million people with fundamental AI skills. “Google’s new AI Essentials course will teach people to use AI effectively in day-to-day work. In under 10 hours, people will get practical, hands-on experience using AI to help with work tasks through videos, readings, and interactive exercises,” a press release reads. One of the fund’s first recipients, Syracuse University’s D’Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF), will provide the new AI Essentials course and a Google Cybersecurity Certificate to its Onward to Opportunity participants in Virginia and across the country, according to the release. Gov. Glenn Youngkin spotlighted the state’s technological advances, noting that Northern Virginia is the global hub for data centers with more development than the next five U.S. markets combined. “With that comes tremendous synergy and an ecosystem that enables advanced development,” Youngkin said. “And so, Google’s $1 billion investment is a continued demonstration that that ecosystem is one worth investing in.” Youngkin also said local communities are benefitting from data centers by paying $2.2 billion in wages and “a billion dollars in local revenue that funds an immense investment in schools and public services and social services.” At the same time, some localities have moved to more closely regulate data centers in response to concerns about their neighborhood and environmental impacts. Fairfax County will hold community meetings starting this Thursday (May 2) to gather feedback on its proposed zoning changes. In the press release on Google’s announcement, IVMF Executive Director Dr. Mike Haynie expressed appreciation for the technology giant’s continual backing. “We are extremely proud to receive continued support from google.org that will allow us not only to continue to deliver the cybersecurity training that we’re currently delivering to the military connected community, but now also enhance the support we can provide to our nation service members, veterans and military spouses through AI training,” he said.",https://www.ffxnow.com/files/2024/04/Google-CFO-Ruth-Porat.jpg,2024-04-29,0.324,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Virginia', 'latitude': 37.548118591308594, 'longitude': -77.44674682617188, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Loudoun County', 'latitude': 39.083438873291016, 'longitude': -77.64971160888672, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Prince William County', 'latitude': 38.70011901855469, 'longitude': -77.48303985595703, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reston', 'latitude': 38.968719482421875, 'longitude': -77.34110260009766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Porat', 'latitude': 32.27626037597656, 'longitude': 34.94873809814453, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Syracuse University', 'latitude': 43.037841796875, 'longitude': -76.13465118408203, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Onward', 'latitude': 40.694759368896484, 'longitude': -86.19499206542969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Opportunity', 'latitude': 47.64994812011719, 'longitude': -117.23990631103516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fairfax County', 'latitude': 38.8501091003418, 'longitude': -77.3497085571289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",I don t know,"Google plans to invest $1 billion in Northern Virginia data center campuses, including two Loudoun County sites and a Prince William County site.

Should Google Have Fired Its Protesting Employees? - RetailWire,Should Google Have Fired Its Protesting Employees?

The demonstrators opposed a $1.2 billion 2021 Google Cloud contract — known as Project Nimbus — that calls upon Google and Amazon to provide the Israeli government with cloud computing and artificial intelligence services. Protesters claim Google’s services are being used to harm Palestinians. In a note to employees, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said, “We have a culture of vibrant, open discussion… But ultimately we are a workplace and our policies and expectations are clear: this is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics.” Google also said that Project Nimbus is “not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.” In a blog post, No Tech For Apartheid, the organizers of the protests, accused Google of lying about what happened inside its offices during what it described as a “peaceful sit-in” that received overwhelming support from other workers who weren’t participating in the protest. “This flagrant act of retaliation is a clear indication that Google values its $1.2 billion contract with the genocidal Israeli government and military more than its own workers,” No Tech For Apartheid asserted. Driven by younger workers and customers who gravitate to brands that align with their values, businesses in recent years began staking out public positions on social issues, including immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, gun control, and racial justice after George Floyd’s 2020 murder. It’s become more common to see consumer boycott threats as well as employee unrest tied to a company’s position on issues or actions. At Google, workers in the past have challenged the tech giant over issues including diversity within its workforce, sexual misconduct among executives, and other controversial contracts. In 2018, Google workers successfully pushed the company to end a deal with the U.S. Defense Department that would have helped the military analyze drone videos. However, the sit-ins around the divisive Israel-Hamas war apparently crossed the line. “The Israel-Hamas war is dividing employees in ways that I don’t think the debate over police brutality, for instance, ever did,” David Primo, a professor of political science and business administration at the University of Rochester in New York, told USA Today. Among other firms, Amazon employees have also attended rallies and signed a petition to management, calling for the company to end its involvement in the Google Cloud contract. In early April, nearly 400 current and former Apple employees published an open letter alleging that several Apple Store and corporate employees have been disciplined or “wrongfully terminated” for expressing support for Palestinian people by wearing pins, bracelets, or keffiyeh. Workers at Procter & Gamble, Nike, and Instacart all expressed displeasure, in Slack messages or emails to executives, with the way their companies have handled the response to the Israel-Hamas conflict, according to Bloomberg. Americans remain divided over whether corporations should take stands on big political issues, although younger people feel strongly they should. A survey of 1,500 U.S. and Canadian employees from the HR platform Achievers Workforce Institute taken in March found half of employees want to work for organizations that take public stands on world events, with younger generations (Gen Z and millennials) nearly twice as likely to want their companies to engage. A survey of 600 C-suite leaders released last week by executive women networking group Chief found that 87% of executives believe taking a public stance on a social issue is riskier than staying silent, but 90% agreed they’re under pressure from stakeholders to take (or not take) a public stand. The pressure comes from three angles: external voices (the public, customers, and community leaders), cited by 73%; internal stakeholders (employees and shareholders), 60%; and company leadership (values of leadership team and board of directors), 58%.",https://retailwire.com/wp-content/uploads/Protest-©Vesnaandjic-via-Canva.com_.png,2024-04-29,-0.154,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Amazon', 'latitude': 46.32020950317383, 'longitude': -112.10722351074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tech', 'latitude': 20.950000762939453, 'longitude': -75.96666717529297, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Israel', 'latitude': 31.5, 'longitude': 34.75, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hamas', 'latitude': 41.25014114379883, 'longitude': 43.0554084777832, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'University of Rochester', 'latitude': 43.12833023071289, 'longitude': -77.62832641601562, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'USA', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Procter', 'latitude': 49.61777877807617, 'longitude': -116.96111297607422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gamble', 'latitude': 47.366859436035156, 'longitude': -80.58306121826172, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nike', 'latitude': 31.958389282226562, 'longitude': 100.27298736572266, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Slack', 'latitude': 49.01691818237305, 'longitude': -82.33309936523438, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Institute', 'latitude': 35.35765838623047, 'longitude': -77.71385955810547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gen', 'latitude': 8.194169998168945, 'longitude': -7.110829830169678, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]",I don t know,Not-related content

In a presentation kicking off the NewFronts in New York, Google execs gave Hollywood a significant spotlight. The tech giant announced a number of partnerships with companies using its Display & Video 360 tools, including Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global. Google also announced that it is one of the first partners to directly integrate into Disney’s Real-time Ad Exchange, or DRAX. ” Kristen O’Hara, VP, Agency, Platforms & Client Solutions at Google, emceed the NewFront and recapped the day’s announcements in a blog post. The DRAX integration, she said, will help advertisers target consumers directly via Disney’s streaming portfolio, “at more meaningful moments, with more speed and flexibility,” she said. Marketers using Google’s DV360 have seen a 120% higher return on ad spend compared to third-party video bought directly and an 18% higher return on ad spend than they get on linear TV. Pete Chelala, VP, Programmatic Advertising Sales at Paramount and Jill Steinhauser, SVP, Ad Sales Revenue and Planning at WBD, joined O’Hara onstage for a conversation about how they work with Google. The tech company’s offerings let advertisers “seamlessly” access Paramount inventory, Chelala said, while Steinhauser said they let Max advertisers “programmatically reach audiences at scale, unifying their media in one place.” NBCUniversal also got into the mix at the Google NewFront. John Lee, Chief Data Officer at NBCU, made an appearance to tout the company’s “pretty significant transformation” as it pushes into streaming. Since Peacock’s launch in 2020, he said, we have invested “a lot in our first-party data.” While the event was branded for Google, YouTube got plenty of attention. The video giant has shifted its main pitch to advertisers out of NewFronts week and into the main upfront week in mid-May.

The stat comes from the Chocolate Factory's latest report, in which the ad biz said its ""investment in new and improved security features, policy updates, and advanced machine learning and app review processes,"" had helped find malicious code before it could get in the Store. These policy updates included refreshed rules tackling AI apps, bothersome notifications, and privacy. Google put particular emphasis on its new requirement for devs to allow the deletion of account data without needing to reinstall an app. Plus, app devs had to provide more info about themselves and meet the latest testing requirements. The Google security team's new toys and rules helped it to not only prevent 2.28 million potentially malicious apps from being published on Google Play, but also assisted in bringing down the ban hammer on 333,000 accounts, or so we're told. Google also rejected a further 200,000 apps for not handling sensitive permissions properly. Google pulls malware-infected apps in its Store, over 3 million users at risk This legit Android app turned into mic-snooping malware – and Google missed it Oh, look: More malware in the Google Play store Google sues app devs, claims they're Play Store crypto scammers with 100k+ victims Compared to the Chocolate Factory's report in 2022 app rejections went up 850K, from 1.43 million. It's unclear how many apps were rejected for sensitive permissions issues in 2022, but the report says Google blocked 500K apps from 2020 to 2022 in total. The Android-owner attributes its success to better security tools and policies, which is also what it said in 2022. A difference in counting methodology may explain the high increase in app rejections for security issues, as Google points out it now measures violations based on communications sent, which is what the EU's Digital Services Act mandates. It's not entirely clear how comparable 2023's figures are to 2022's. Of course, Google didn't catch every violation last year. For example, a screen recording app received an update in August 2022 to make it more of a snooping app, and Google was totally unaware of it until ESET warned them in May of last year. El Reg archives are filled with examples of bad apps that made it into the Android Play Store, so if Google's putting a decent roadblock in front of that stuff, it's about time.",https://regmedia.co.uk/2018/08/28/android_shutterstock.jpg,2024-04-29,-0.395,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Store', 'latitude': 46.20111083984375, 'longitude': 15.32721996307373, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",I don t know,"Google Play Store blocked 2.28 million malicious apps in 2023, an 850K increase from 2022.

Additionally, the tech giant reports that it identified and blocked 333,000 Google Play accounts that uploaded malware, fraudulent apps, or engaged in repeated grave policy violations. For comparison, in 2022, Google blocked 1.5 million ""bad"" apps and suspended 173,000 developer accounts for severe violations of the store's policies. Last year's enforcement was part of Google's effort to safeguard Android's official app store, which billions of people use to source software that makes their devices more useful. This effort is based on the so-called 'SAFE' principles, which Google highlights as: (S)afeguard Users, (A)dvocate for Developer Protection, (F)oster Responsible Innovation, (E)volve Platform Defenses. The identification of malicious submissions and removal of risky content already available on Google Play was bolstered by recently-introduced reviewing and security initiatives, including: More stringent developer registration and ID verification process. Introduction of independent security reviews and badges for Android VPN apps. Addition of real-time scanning to block malware from executing. Firmware hardening to make SoC-level flaws harder to exploit. Expansion of the SDK index (now covers 6 million apps) to help developers pick safe SDKs for their projects. In addition to blocking nearly 2.3 million apps and suspending 333,000 offending publishers, Google has rejected or remediated 200,000 app submissions requesting access to risky permissions such as SMS content and background location data without a good reason. Finally, Google has partnered with 31 SDK providers to ensure that only a minimal amount of sensitive information is collected and shared from devices where apps utilizing these SDKs are installed. The tech firm says this initiative directly impacts 790,000 apps available on Google Play, which translates to potentially tens of millions of users or possibly more. Just last month, researchers found 17 ""free"" VPN apps on Google Play that used a malicious monetization SDK that hijacked Android devices to act as unwitting residential proxies, likely used for cybercrime and shopping bots. Although Google Play isn't completely immune to malware, spyware, and adware apps, Google's and its partners' efforts at the App Defense Alliance to tackle the problem make it increasingly harder to sneak malware onto the store and keep it undetected for long. That being said, Android users are recommended to source their apps only from Google Play and avoid installing software from APK apps downloaded from poorly vetted third-party stores. Also, regularly check that Play Protect is active on the device, periodically review background power and data consumption to identify suspicious processes, and remove permissions granted to apps that aren't needed for their core functions.",https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2023/09/15/Google.jpg,2024-04-29,-0.438,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SoC', 'latitude': 11.550000190734863, 'longitude': 106.08332824707031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Google blocked 2.28 million Android apps and 333,000 accounts for policy violations, malware, and fraud.

As the source mentioned, this might be an idea that may be inspired by iOS's ""Live Activities,"" which uses a similar method. Since phone screens are smaller than tablets, this lock screen approach might not exactly work for them. However, Google already has something in place that can serve as a base for this feature: At a Glance. If you use a Pixel phone, you may be familiar with ""At a Glance,"" a widget-like element already in place on the home and lock screens which displays information taken from your calendar events, weather, and traffic alerts. The potential for the existing ""At a Glance"" widget to host widgets from other applications stems from a recent API change that is reportedly in the works, according to findings by Mishaal Rahman (via Android Authority). In this change, Google is said to be working toward making At a Glance compatible with RemoteViews, which is the base code for Android widgets. Of course, Google would need to overcome a few challenges before this change becomes a reality. Widgets would need to become resizable to fit in the limited lock screen space. Google would also need to make sure those widgets don't crash At a Glance or, worse, the whole lock screen. On top of that, Google would need to convince other smartphone manufacturers to include At a Glance on their phones. This comes at a time when Google is also backing the use of customized lock screens via Glance, a lock screen widget already available on some budget Android devices. Glance adds a rotating selection of news and advertisements to your standard lock screen. It isn't exactly the Pixel ""At a Glance"" widget, but it demonstrates that Google is to an extent open to the use of widgets on the lock screen. It's unclear when (or if) these changes will happen – it could even be as far off as the next major Android release after Android 15. But for those nostalgic for lock screen widgets, and anyone who wants quick access to app info without always unlocking their phone, there's definitely hope on the horizon.",https://m-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/157852-wide-two_1200/Google-could-be-embracing-lock-screen-widgets-again-by-opening-the-At-a-Glance-widget-to-other-apps.jpg,2024-04-29,-0.166,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'iOS', 'latitude': 36.72077178955078, 'longitude': 25.330469131469727, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pixel', 'latitude': 51.895450592041016, 'longitude': 8.27793025970459, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'API', 'latitude': 3.650369882583618, 'longitude': 25.327869415283203, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]",I don t know,"Google is reportedly working on bringing lock screen widgets to Android 15 tablets, inspired by iOS's ""Live Activities.""

But now he’s decided to let at least one of his myriad homes go, having put his longtime Northern California compound up for sale. The asking price is $24.5 million, or roughly 12 times more than the former CEO and chairman of Google doled out for the property a little more than three decades ago, back in 1990. The listing is held by Katharine Carroll of Compass. Completed in the late 1960s, but extensively remodeled during Schmidt’s tenure, the 3.3-acre spread in the affluent Silicon Valley enclave of Atherton includes a main European-inspired mansion and newer guesthouse designed by Schwanke Architecture—for a total of five bedrooms and eight bathrooms in a little more than 5,200 square feet. Fronting the residence are two gated driveways that empty out at a trio of motorcourts, including one resting adjacent to a detached three-car garage boasting a lower-level recreation room. Once inside, an entry foyer displaying herringbone-style hardwood floors and a curving iron-railed staircase flows on one side to a living room highlighted by a fireplace and doors spilling out to a terrace, formal dining room, and kitchen outfitted with custom marble countertops, Waterworks fixtures, dual sinks and dishwashers and a Thermador range. An accompanying breakfast nook lined with a bay window opens to a patio sporting a water feature. A sky-lit hallway on the opposite side of the foyer leads to a fireside sitting room, handsome wood-paneled office/study with a full bath and wet bar-equipped family room that connects via a fireplace to a sunroom; and upstairs, an inviting primary bedroom comes complete with access to an expansive private terrace, a dressing room, and luxe bath spotlighted by a soaking tub and marble shower. Especially standing out are the picturesque grounds, which are laced with mature plants and specimen trees, and host a swimming pool and spa, as well as numerous spots ideal for al fresco lounging and entertaining. Rounding it all out: a separate building for the security team, along with a charming Amdega Conservatory imported from the United Kingdom that now serves as a greenhouse.

While the smartphone has not been officially announced, plenty of rumors have already given us an idea of what to expect. Thanks to an exclusive report from Android Headlines, a couple of additional critical details regarding the Pixel 8a have surfaced, reportedly the budget phone will get an updated AI Camera and 7 years of security update support. 7 years of updates The Google Pixel 7a came with ""at least five years"" of software security updates, making it a budget smartphone you could hold onto for quite some time without worrying about hacks or software vulnerabilities putting your data at risk. However, according to this rumor, the Pixel 8a will receive seven years of security updates, giving two additional years over the Pixel 7a. This alone may make the Google Pixel 8a our best smartphone for most users when it launches later this month. It's important to note that this isn't quite as good as the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, which get seven years of security updates and seven years of OS updates. Security updates are the more important of the two though, particularly on Android where many feature updates come from app updates rather than OS updates. The Pixel 8a will also come with Google One VPN, which seems odd as the software is scheduled for sunsetting in June. It will also be certified with an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. AI Camera features As reported by Android Headlines, ""With the Pixel 8a, Google is touting the “AI-mazing” Camera on the phone. Giving it features like Audio Magic Eraser, Night Sight, and Best Take."" The Pixel 7a already had access to Google's Night Sight feature and a version of Best Take. Audio Magic Eraser was a new feature added to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro last fall. Per Android Headlines's report, the Pixel 8a will also come with Call Assist, email summaries, and Circle to Search features for general productivity support. The exclusive also confirms that the Pixel 8a will run on Google's Tensor G3 chipset platform. We shouldn't have to wait much longer to find out if this report was right, Google I/O 2024 is just a couple of weeks away, so stay tuned and we'll bring you the latest on the Pixel 8a and everything else Google may have to announce at I/O.

That’s up from 72 in the CMA’s Q4 2023 report, released January. Why we care. The CMA’s January report made it clear that Google couldn’t proceed with third-party cookie deprecation. Sure enough, Google announced a third delay in the phase-out of cookies, with hopes to complete the process in 2025. But again, this is just a delay. Third-party cookies will go away. Why the concerns? The CMO and the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) are concerned the Privacy Sandbox could make Google even more dominant, giving them an unfair advantage that could hurt advertisers, competing ad platforms, publishers and users. Multi-touch concerns. One addition to the report is around concerns over Google’s approach to attribution: “Stakeholders have expressed further concerns around Google’s approach to multi-touch attribution, arguing that ‘single touch’ attribution is likely to advantage Google.” “For example, a current user journey may involve seeing an ad several times on different properties (e.g. a publisher site, their social media feed, etc) before the user takes an action. Users may also act on their intent to convert by searching for the advertised product. Stakeholders are concerned that Google is likely to be the ‘last touch’ and therefore capture more of the value from conversions than other market participants.” “We have shared this feedback with Google and await its response.” What is Google’s Privacy Sandbox? Google is introducing the Privacy Sandbox program as an alternative to third-party cookies to enable advertisers to deliver targeted ads in Chrome while minimizing improper cross-site and cross-app tracking. Dig deeper. Google’s Privacy Sandbox: What you need to know on MarTech. Maybe 2025. Google started phasing out third-party cookies to 1% of Chrome users in January. However, Google announced yet another delay to third-party cookie deprecation on April 24: “We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will continue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem. It’s also critical that the CMA has sufficient time to review all evidence including results from industry tests, which the CMA has asked market participants to provide by the end of June. Given both of these significant considerations, we will not complete third-party cookie deprecation during the second half of Q4. We remain committed to engaging closely with the CMA and ICO and we hope to conclude that process this year. Assuming we can reach an agreement, we envision proceeding with third-party cookie deprecation starting early next year.” Privacy Sandbox update The report.

Specifics remain under wraps. But it likely involves a smoother and more secure signup process for using your Google Wallet on public transit. It might also be linked to the new “Verification settings” for transit payments. This option allows users to choose whether they need to authenticate before using their payment methods and passes in Wallet. Adding to the convenience factor, Google Wallet now lets you scan images with barcodes or QR codes and instantly add them as passes. This eliminates the need for manual entry, making it easier to store loyalty cards, gift cards, and more within the app. Support for American Express on Fitbit devices initially appeared in the changelog. However, it was unfortunately rolled back. This is a point of contention for some users who previously enjoyed using Amex with Fitbit Pay. So hopefully, Google will reintroduce this functionality soon. Beyond the latest update, Google Wallet has seen many updates in recent weeks. Users can now long-press the app icon to create shortcuts for their stored cards on the home screen for faster access during checkouts. However, some security enhancements have caused minor grumbles. Google Wallet now requires more frequent authentication. It also now prompts users to re-verify their identity with every payment. While these undoubtedly bolster security, they can disrupt a smooth payment flow, especially when waiting in line. Google Wallet could be launched in India soon Besides the new features, a recent Google Play Store listing recently hinted that Google Wallet might finally be making its way to India.

What to Expect from Closing Arguments in the DOJ's Search Case Against Google - Medium,What to Expect from Closing Arguments in the DOJ's Search Case Against Google  Medium,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 22:42:56 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL21lZGl1bS5jb20vY2hhbWJlci1vZi1wcm9ncmVzcy93aGF0LXRvLWV4cGVjdC1mcm9tLWNsb3NpbmctYXJndW1lbnRzLWluLXRoZS1kb2pzLXNlYXJjaC1jYXNlLWFnYWluc3QtZ29vZ2xlLTIxNmYyNTExZGY5Yj9yZXNwb25zZXNPcGVuPXRydWUmc29ydEJ5PVJFVkVSU0VfQ0hST07SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Medium,"Markets 2 & 3: Search Advertising and Text Ads Plaintiffs also carved out relevant antitrust markets for search advertising and text ads that rely on the marketing funnel to distinguish them from other forms of advertising such as display ads. The Department of Justice describes search ads as “the only channel that can be targeted to reach a consumer precisely when a consumer expresses interest in a product or service, referred to as a moment of ‘intent.’” Google poked holes in the Department of Justice’s over-reliance on the funnel and highlighted the fact that digital advertising allows advertisers to shift their spend across different ad types in order to maximize their return on investment. Advertisers’ decisions at best may be influenced by general concepts from the marketing funnel, but in the rapidly evolving landscape of digital ads, return on investment is the deciding factor that drives decision making. Even the Department of Justice’s expert on digital marketing, Wilfred Amaldoss, conceded that ad types can run across all levels of the funnel. There were also a number of advertisers who testified that they were willing to shift spend in and out of the Department of Justice’s proposed market in order to maximize their ad spend and some stated that they were “agnostic” when it came to varying advertising channels. Another problem with the Plaintiffs’ proposed search advertising market is that they exclude the kinds of digital advertising that have a high degree of audience overlap but include those with less overlap. Google’s economics expert, Dr. Israel, testified that empirical data shows that consumers frequently visit a Meta platform, Amazon, or other websites during the same web session in which they search on Google but it is much rarer for them to visit Google and another general search engine in the same session: “Proper consideration of the relevant markets would fully account for the unbridled growth of Google’s closest competitors for advertisers’ dollars, including digital advertising behemoths Meta, Amazon, and TikTok“ Is Google A Lazy Monopolist Or Has It Continued to Innovate And Improve Search? Plaintiffs allege that Google maintains a monopoly and its conduct has therefore “reduced its incentive to innovate, invest, and improve.” The crux of their argument is that Google settles for being “good enough” because it has insulated itself from competition. However, Google hinged much of its defense on dispelling the notion that it has grown complacent and walked the court through the tremendous growth of general search engine output over the last twenty-five years as well as its continued pursuit of improvements to its search engine that “push its quality to new heights year after year”. Even Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella testified that Google is “competing every day to improve search” and “on search, I think the competition is pretty intense.” Contrary to the Plaintiffs’ claims that search quality has decreased over the relevant period, Google continues to set measurable goals in improving, referred to as an IS score. It has made breakthrough innovations in artificial intelligence as well as gleaning improved insights from search quality engineers and human raters. Plaintiffs also failed to establish that Google raised search ad prices. Google and its competitors adjust search ad prices to catch up to quality improvements in order to share in the value of those improvements. An increase in price that corresponds with an increase in quality is reflective of competition in digital advertising and the need for firms to restore equilibrium so they can continue to make investments and innovations. Are Google’s Search Agreements Anticompetitive Or Par For The Course? Fewer things during this trial drew more oohs and aahs than the amount of money that is paid by Google to secure default deals on browsers. We learned that Google pays Apple 36% of its search revenue from Safari, which is worth roughly eighteen billion dollars. Plaintiffs also repeatedly characterized Google’s browser default search agreements with Apple, Mozilla, and others as “exclusive” dealing arrangements that serve as a barrier to entry for rivals. But Google rebutted these claims by noting that the agreements allow the browser developer to promote search rivals on the same browser, and Apple and Mozilla have in fact done so time and time again. Mozilla entered into promotional deals with Microsoft, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo — and Google’s agreement with Apple does not impact Apple’s ability to preinstall another search application or browser that defaults to a rival search engine on Apple devices. Google’s agreement with Mozilla also does not hinder a users’ ability to access a rival search engine. Actual user behavior contradicts plaintiffs’ assertion that browser default agreements are “de facto” exclusive. Instead of simply looking at the popularity of Google search on browsers where it is the default, Google’s success where it is not the default is compelling evidence that users can and do switch to search engines they prefer regardless of the default. So what is the value of the default and why does Google pay so much? Google CEO, Sundhar Pichai, said it best calling the agreements “enhanced promotions” and a seamless way for users to access Google: …the dollar amounts that Google pays to its partners reflect competition against other search engines who also offer payments to be the default, but as importantly, these payments reflect that Apple and Android devices have proven to be extraordinarily popular with consumers and widely used by them to search online, and that Google’s search advertising technologies have proven to be incredibly valuable to advertisers. The billions that Google pays each year to search partners is a textbook example of a thriving competitive marketplace, where search and search advertising quality and output have continually improved over the very time period where Plaintiffs try in vain to find antitrust violations. Google acknowledges that search defaults are powerful — but that search quality matters more. In order for the Department of Jusice to win, they have to successfully convince the judge that defaults are all that matters in search. That’s a tall order. At the close of the evidentiary phase of the trial, Judge Mehta said he had “no idea” how he would rule in this landmark case. In the time since then, all sides have condensed millions of pages of evidence into concise briefs in addition to the more substantive findings of facts and conclusions of law that were submitted to the court. Following closing arguments, it is unclear how long Judge Mehta will need to deliberate before handing down a ruling. Either side will appeal a loss — and if Google loses, we would likely see a lengthy remedies process.",https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1200/0*J9lLQFgBfqr_UOxp,2024-04-29,-0.035,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Mozilla', 'description': 'company', 'full_name': 'Mozilla Corporation', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/MozillaEvelynAveHeadquarters.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Yahoo', 'description': 'American internet company (2017–present)', 'full_name': 'Yahoo Inc.', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Yahoo%21_%282019%29.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Department of Justice', 'latitude': 14.579360008239746, 'longitude': 120.98387145996094, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meta', 'latitude': 40.63920974731445, 'longitude': 14.41823959350586, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Amazon', 'latitude': 46.32020950317383, 'longitude': -112.10722351074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Safari', 'latitude': -25.07110023498535, 'longitude': 31.131240844726562, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mehta', 'latitude': 33.0124397277832, 'longitude': 73.59799194335938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Google faces antitrust lawsuits alleging monopoly in search advertising and text ads.

According to a recent report from 9to5Google, the feature only works for new installs and will only work for two apps. If you select two differing downloads you can see them download simultaneously in the store and on the home screen. If you select more than two apps to download the third will be listed as pending until one app finishes. Google Play’s simultaneous downloads do not apply to application updates, which would arguably be more useful as those are the more common downloads. We can only hope that the feature to download multiple updates will come in a later update as Google gets more comfortable with the software. According to 9to5Google, this feature has been seen on several Pixel phones and tablets running Android 14 and version 40.6.31 of the Play Store. (Image credit: 9to5 Google) Google Play has seen several recent updates, including a recent security update where Google emailed Android users about an upcoming Play Store chance to encourage purchase verification via biometric identification. Turning on biometric verification in the Play Store currently requires your Google Account password to proceed. However, this will be done via fingerprint or facial recognition in the future instead. This increased security comes as certain threats from the Play Store seem to be on the rise. It was recently reported several apps from the Play Store hold malicious malware and adware programs that have infected millions of phones. There have also been several reports that malicious loader programs are being sold on the dark web, which allows hackers to install programs onto legitimate apps. (Image credit: senengmotret / Shutterstock.com) The news that Google has finally released multiple downloads is great for Pixel users, but with that increased download capability comes added risk. However, It appears that Google is aware of the issue and is working to fix it as we speak. However, it could be worth holding off on any major downloads until Android 15, which we expect to be announced at the next Google I/O. Keep an eye on both our hubs for all the information and rumors as we hear them.

Reports suggest that Google has disbanded its entire Python team, purportedly in an effort to streamline expenses by outsourcing work to cheaper labor markets outside the US.A former Google employee, Matt Hu, took to LinkedIn to recount the night he discovered his layoff, along with his manager and several team members. Hu, a software engineer at Google for the past two years, shared his experience of receiving the unsettling news.As Hu opened his laptop around 9 pm, he encountered a perplexing email indicating a ""Cloudtop StopInstance operation."" Sensing trouble, Hu's apprehensions intensified when he lost access to multiple sites and experienced a forced laptop reboot. Subsequently, an email titled ""Notice regarding your employment"" confirmed his fears - his tenure at Google had abruptly ended.""I went downstairs and opened up my laptop. That was 21:00. I got a weird email saying 'You Cloudtop StopInstance operation has begun' and I suddenly recalled I just had the cloudtop maintenance a few days back, it couldn't be a scheduled task, there is definitely something bad happening. I even 'Momaed' (Google's internal search engine) 'what stop instance means' and I did get the results from the website, so I chose not to believe I was leaving the company,"" he said in a post. In a poignant revelation, Hu disclosed that upon communicating with coworkers, he learned that several teammates had also been affected. He described drafting a farewell email to colleagues under his skip manager, only to receive another email announcing his direct manager's layoff, along with the team lead from a neighboring team. ""While I was drafting a farewell (basically an advertising) email to people under my skip manager, I received another email from my direct manager. He got laid off too, together with the TL at our neighbor team,"" he said in the post. ""My hands were shaking while reading,"" he mentioned in the post. Reflecting on the impact of the layoffs, Hu expressed shock at the loss of his manager, a veteran at Google for almost 13 years, who had played a pivotal role in founding their team. Despite the turmoil, Hu commended his manager's professionalism and offered words of solidarity with his displaced colleagues.Hu disclosed that approximately half of the team had been let go, evoking a sense of camaraderie and solidarity among those affected. Sharing a poignant image from the company's rooftop, Hu highlighted the resilience of his team amidst adversity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-109701678/109701678.jpg",2024-04-29,-0.389,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'LinkedIn', 'description': 'social networking website for people in professional occupations', 'full_name': 'LinkedIn', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Linkedin_screenshot.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DELHI', 'latitude': 28.653810501098633, 'longitude': 77.22897338867188, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Python', 'latitude': 51.64693832397461, 'longitude': 5.053609848022461, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",I don t know,"Google has laid off its entire Python team, affecting approximately half of the team, including a veteran manager with 13 years of experience.

Not only did the company beat expectations, but it also promised to hand out its first ever dividend, something that made investors very happy. As a result, its stock was up 14 percent, making it the fourth tech company with a market value over $2 trillion. Obviously, investors like it when companies say they made a lot of money. What they really like, however, is when companies talk about how much money they're going to make in the future. Or, more specifically, when they talk about what the business will do in the future. Right now, that's why every tech company is talking about how they are sprinkling artificial intelligence (AI) into everything they're doing. Google is no different in that regard. Over the past year, the company has spent a lot of time reminding people that it's been doing AI since before AI was cool. There may be new players, but Google Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, reminded everyone of this on the company's call with analysts. ""We have the best infrastructure for the AI era,"" Pichai said. ""Building world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power search. Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable, and efficient in the world."" I actually think Pichai makes an important point. Yes, the company is working on integrating AI across its hardware and software, and--of course--in search. It also released its Large Language Model (LLM), known as Gemini (originally Bard), last year in response to the sudden success of ChatGPT. But, Google has been doing this for a while. At its most basic, I suppose you could think of search as AI. It's essentially a computer trying to figure out what you mean when you ask for something, and then trying to figure out which websites contain the information you want. Of course, we don't think of search as AI--we think of it as one of the most ordinary things we do on a daily basis. At the same time, the reason we think of it as ordinary is because Google has built out the infrastructure to make search as effortless as possible. It has the computers and the servers and the software to do this at scale--in a way that not many of its competitors can. ""We have six products with more than 2 billion monthly users, including 3 billion Android devices,"" said Pichai. That's a lot of devices and a lot of users. That's a lot of scale that That doesn't mean Google has gotten it right. The controversy over its Gemini release earlier this year was so bad I argued, at the time, that it could cost Pichai his job. That hasn't happened, and it looks as though Pichai has mostly weathered the storm. A big reason for that, I think, is that none of this is new for Google. It's true that it does have the best infrastructure for the ""AI era,"" whatever that means. On the one hand, I guess you could argue that's as good a reason as any that Google should have done better at all of this so far. On the other hand, it's definitely the case that when Google finally figures it out, it'll be far better positioned than any other company. By most estimates, Google owns around 2.5 million servers, which is a million more than Amazon, which is in second place. To be clear, not all servers are the same, and just having a lot of them doesn't mean you'll necessarily be good at generative AI. But Google has been doing all kinds of AI-adjacent things for years, and has the benefit of all of that training and experience. It understands how to do this at scale and has the infrastructure to support it. There's a lesson here that the companies that are best suited to succeed aren't always the first ones to jump on the new shiny-new-toy-bandwagon. In fact, this story is a great example of the reality that often times success happens when you work really hard at something for a long time and then get a little bit lucky. As a leader, your job is to not be distracted just because something new comes along. Your job is to focus on what you do better than anyone, and then adapt when the opportunity comes to leverage your expertise. That's exactly what Google is doing here, and it's a brilliant lesson for every leader.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/w_1024,h_576,c_fill/images/panoramic/getty_2135840737_200013682000928079_bzlzbu.jpg",2024-04-28,-0.42,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pichai', 'latitude': 17.289520263671875, 'longitude': 100.08837890625, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'LLM', 'latitude': 52.11399841308594, 'longitude': -3.555000066757202, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gemini', 'latitude': 13.17300033569336, 'longitude': -59.63100051879883, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bard', 'latitude': 45.58662033081055, 'longitude': 4.014689922332764, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chat', 'latitude': 31.01589012145996, 'longitude': 50.022979736328125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Amazon', 'latitude': 46.32020950317383, 'longitude': -112.10722351074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Google's parent company, Alphabet, announced strong quarterly earnings and its first-ever dividend, boosting its stock value.

More than anything, you just don't get the details wrong, and Google got everything wrong that it could have Google Play got off to the most spectacular start possible, posting an image with the caption: ""1991 Sonic. The cover? Rotund. Husky. Still fast as lightning. The actual game? 8-bit GLORY."" Sonic the Hedgehog did see a release on the 8-bit Master System, but the game that made it a smash hit was the 16-bit Genesis / Mega Drive version. Google's crimes didn't end there though: the image features Tails. Thus comes the first of many community notes, the X feature that allows community sourced corrections to popular tweets, which pointed out the above before going in with both red sneakers. ""Tails (seen in picture) was not created until 1992 for Sonic the Hedgehog 2,"" reads the note, ""meaning this is not a 1991 Sonic, but rather a later port of the original game."" Sit down and shut up, Google Play! Reader, it did not. In fact things got even worse. The whole hog The above tweet claims this image of Sonic is from 1993, and my old ass can assure you that no videogames looked like this in 1993. The imperious community note dismisses Google Play's nonsense, and even theorises about why it made such a mistake: ""This is Sonic as he appears in Sonic Boom,"" reads the note, ""which released in 2014, not 1993. It is possible that Google Play have confused it for the game Sonic CD, which did release in 1993 and contains a song called Sonic Boom."" Stick that one in your pipe and smoke it, Sundar. Unbelievably things get worse. Next up is ""1996 Sonic. Are those the MSCHF boots???"" This is accompanied by an image of a much later game, and you can tell by this point the Sonic fans are getting tetchy: not only does the community note identify the game the image is actually from, 2013's Sonic Dash, but goes on to helpfully list all the Sonic games that actually did release in 1996. If only there were some indexed search resource to easily find such information! ""2003 Sonic,"" is up next, according to Google, which then posts an image taken from promotional material from Sonic Jump (2005). The community note again lists all the games that did release in that year, a pattern followed on Google Play's subsequent tweets about ""2006 Sonic"" (""This image is from the 2017 mobile game Sonic Forces Mobile,"" reads the community note). You can almost feel the temple vein of Sonic fandom collectively throbbing at this point. ""2018 Sonic,"" notes Google, ""weirdly looked like 90's Sonic."" Well maybe that's because ""the image is actually a screenshot from the original 1991 game"" you morons, and by the way ""Sonic Mania released in 2017."" ""2020 Sonic,"" says Google, with an image apparently from the 2020 film. Finally, it got one right! Not so, say the eagle-eyed hog nerds: ""this frame came from the second Sonic the Hedgehog film which came out on 2022 not 2020"" the community note sputters, incredulous at this continued car crash. Finally Google decides to tap out with its worst effort yet: ""2022 Sonic,"" says Google. ""Just like us, he’s healed from 2020 but isn’t quite the same."" ""This image has been digitally altered to attempt to remove characters in the background,"" thunders the community note. ""Given the shoddiness of the result, it was likely done by AI."" Plus this image was ""first revealed in 2023"" as a teaser for the Sonic Prime show that ""premiered in 2024."" All in all, this is such terrible posting from Google Play that you half-think it must be deliberate: the only thing that dissuades me otherwise is the Sonic fans coming up with plausible theories for certain of the mistakes. There's also some theorising that this may be down to AI generating the tweets, though these days it's hard to tell whether something is bad because of AI involvement or just bad. But whatever the reason, Google could not have got it more wrong than this. The real treat of course is in the replies, which are just the open-mouthed astonishment of an entire fandom at how they massacred my boy. Indeed, the final word on this whole farrago comes from the meme-happy official Sonic account itself, which simply replied to Google with: ""what are you doing.""",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3U5VF77fZwvjDPJAXHuU4a.jpg,2024-04-29,-0.509,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Alphabet', 'description': 'American holding company and parent company of Google', 'full_name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Googleplex_HQ_%28cropped%29.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'MSCHF', 'description': 'American company', 'full_name': 'MSCHF'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Amy', 'latitude': 33.732051849365234, 'longitude': -92.81543731689453, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'GLORY', 'latitude': 33.53343963623047, 'longitude': -95.53939819335938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hedgehog', 'latitude': 50.940399169921875, 'longitude': 0.31139999628067017, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Genesis', 'latitude': 36.1092414855957, 'longitude': -84.91716766357422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mega Drive'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sundar', 'latitude': 26.372800827026367, 'longitude': 67.78936004638672, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Google Play's attempt at a Sonic the Hedgehog meme went awry, with numerous factual errors in its posts about the character's evolution.

Virginia: Google plans $1 billion data center investment - Roanoke Times,Virginia: Google plans $1 billion data center investment  Roanoke Times,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 23:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFodHRwczovL3JvYW5va2UuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RhdGUtcmVnaW9uYWwvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ29vZ2xlLWRhdGEtY2VudGVycy15b3VuZ2tpbi1jaGVzdGVyZmllbGQtZ2FzLWZpcmVkLXBsYW50LWxvdWRvdW4tZmFpcmZheC1wcmluY2Utd2lsbGlhbS1oZW5yaWNvL2FydGljbGVfYWQxZTBjMWItZjMzMy01ODc2LWFjNGMtMzU4MzA1ZjM3NmRkLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Roanoke Times,"DAVE RESS Richmond Times-Dispatch Google plans a $1 billion investment in Northern Virginia data centers, and in welcoming the move, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said it underscores the need for his “all of the above” energy plan, citing a controversial proposal for a gas-fired power plant in Chesterfield County as an example. Google’s investment will include expanding its two Loudoun County data centers and building a third facility in Prince William County, said Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Google and its parent firm Alphabet. “Google’s $1 billion investment is a … demonstration that Virginia is competing to win, and we want to be at the forefront,” Youngkin said, speaking at the Reston event in Fairfax County. Porat announced the investment, as well as a $75 million fund to provide training in Artificial Intelligence applications, much like a cybersecurity certificate program Google and Youngkin announced last year. Northern Virginia already hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, which generate billions of dollars of tax revenue and wages. But data centers have sparked objections from Northern Virginians who say they are encroaching on homes and schools, parks and national battlefields. They also worry about the amount of land and water the centers need. The energy demand grows Youngkin said: “As we grow, the power demand accelerates as well. And that’s why when we launched our all of the above all American energy plan.” Youngkin’s energy plan says natural gas will remain part of Virginia’s energy mix, along with what Youngkin has described as a “moonshot” effort to develop small nuclear reactors. The plan also calls for research into hydrogen fuel, more efficient batteries and carbon capture as well as the wind- and solar-power generation required by the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which went into force before Youngkin took office. “It’s important that we do embrace all forms so that we can have reliable, affordable and increasingly clean power that powers Virginia’s future,” Youngkin said. “And we see it all around us. We have the largest offshore wind farm in development off the coast in Hampton Roads. We have a natural gas plant in development in Chesterfield County. And three years ago, Virginia was granted a license to build a third nuclear reactor in North Anna,” he added. Dominion Energy’s plans for a gas-fired plant in Chesterfield have sparked opposition from neighbors as well as from environmentalists, who say it violates the Clean Economy Act and will contribute to climate change. Last month, nine Richmond-area General Assembly Democrats joined in a statement to say they oppose the plan, citing “the impact this proposed plant has on statewide efforts to reduce fossil fuel usage, lower carbon emissions, enforce the Commonwealth’s policy on environmental justice, and pursue renewable energy sources and technologies.” Richmond area data centers Beyond Northern Virginia, the enormous amount of electricity that data centers need has fueled environmentalists’ concerns, especially since Dominion Energy, the state’s largest electric utility, says data center growth is one reason why it will have to keep generating some electricity with generators powered by fossil fuel. Wooing data centers is a goal for economic development officials locally. Henrico County, which already hosts two data centers at its White Oak Technology Park, has designated data centers as a target for its economic development authority. It sets a special tax rate of 40 cents per $100 assessed value for data center computers. That is well below its standard $3.50 per $100 business personal property rate for equipment, furniture and other movable property. The county planning commission has given a first stamp of approval to a developer’s plan to rezone 622 acres near White Oak as a technology park to house data centers. And a Denver-based firm wants to develop a 1,211-acre stretch of rural land east of Ashland as a park for data centers with up to 46 buildings and 862 employees. It says it expects the taxable value of the park’s buildings and other land improvements would reach nearly $4 billion within 14 years. The value of the equipment on the site could eventually exceed $23 billion, according to Hanover County planning records. Virginia offers an exemption from retail sales and use tax for data centers’ computer equipment. Virginia was the first state to offer data center tenants the sales tax exemption.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/d1/ad1e0c1b-f333-5876-ac4c-358305f376dd/66301233c5082.preview.jpg?crop=1966%2C1032%2C21%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,2024-04-29,0.054,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Alphabet', 'description': 'American holding company and parent company of Google', 'full_name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Googleplex_HQ_%28cropped%29.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Virginia', 'latitude': 37.548118591308594, 'longitude': -77.44674682617188, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chesterfield County', 'latitude': 37.383480072021484, 'longitude': -77.5997085571289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Loudoun County', 'latitude': 39.083438873291016, 'longitude': -77.64971160888672, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Prince William County', 'latitude': 38.70011901855469, 'longitude': -77.48303985595703, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reston', 'latitude': 38.968719482421875, 'longitude': -77.34110260009766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fairfax County', 'latitude': 38.8501091003418, 'longitude': -77.3497085571289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Porat', 'latitude': 32.27626037597656, 'longitude': 34.94873809814453, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hampton Roads', 'latitude': 36.97515106201172, 'longitude': -76.34967041015625, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'North Anna', 'latitude': 37.890968322753906, 'longitude': -77.5174789428711, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dominion', 'latitude': 48.6074104309082, 'longitude': -117.6683120727539, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chesterfield', 'latitude': 38.4656982421875, 'longitude': -77.61530303955078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Richmond', 'latitude': 37.55376052856445, 'longitude': -77.46025848388672, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Commonwealth', 'latitude': 38.0747184753418, 'longitude': -78.48722076416016, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Henrico County', 'latitude': 37.55015182495117, 'longitude': -77.36637115478516, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Park', 'latitude': 38.21012878417969, 'longitude': -77.23748016357422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'White Oak', 'latitude': 38.30067825317383, 'longitude': -77.37525939941406, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Denver', 'latitude': 39.73915100097656, 'longitude': -104.98470306396484, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ashland', 'latitude': 37.759029388427734, 'longitude': -77.47998046875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hanover County', 'latitude': 37.75014114379883, 'longitude': -77.48303985595703, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",I don t know,"Google plans to invest $1 billion in expanding its data centers in Northern Virginia, including a new facility in Prince William County.

Watchdog reveals lingering Google Privacy Sandbox worries - The Register,Watchdog reveals lingering Google Privacy Sandbox worries  The Register,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 10:15:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA0LzI5L3VrX2NtYV9nb29nbGUv0gE5aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL0FNUC8yMDI0LzA0LzI5L3VrX2NtYV9nb29nbGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Register,"The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) still has privacy and competition concerns about Google's Privacy Sandbox advertising toolkit, which explains why the ad giant recently again delayed its plan to drop third-party cookies in Chrome until 2025. Google for the past few years has been trying to reinvent the software that delivers targeted ads online because the legacy approach, which relies on files called cookies that get used for ad tracking and measurement, denies privacy. The Chocolate Factory refers to its suite of advertising application programming interfaces (APIs) as the Privacy Sandbox, though regulators and privacy advocates continue to raise doubts that the software lives up to its name. Ad industry rivals, not so much concerned about the privacy aspect of the whole affair, worry that Google's reimagined tech stack will put them at a competitive disadvantage by denying them the data they use to make their ads more effective. Last year, Google started rolling out early versions of specific Privacy Sandbox APIs, like the Topics API, in its Chrome browser, in order to test the technology. The ad targeting tech has since been made available for Android applications. The Topics API allows ads to be targeted at users of Chrome, Edge (soon), and Android devices based on interests conveyed through online interactions. The API uses an on-device classifier model to generate a list of interests inferred from browsing activity, based on a publicly accessible taxonomy that presently includes 469 topics like ""Arts & Entertainment."" The API each week determines – locally instead of over a network – a person's top five topics, based on visited sites that implement the Topics API. The website publishers and third-party ad providers on sites supporting the Topics API receive a random list of up to three of the visitor's top five topics over the past three weeks, for a maximum total of five. These interests can be used to present ads that reflect what the visitors presumably want to see. But the system is complicated and Google's assurances about the privacy advantages of its approach haven't convinced everyone, perhaps as a result of the company's persistent involvement in privacy scandals. The CMA on Friday issued its latest update on Google's commitments to implement its Privacy Sandbox ad technologies in a way that doesn't put rivals at a disadvantage. Cops cuff man for allegedly framing colleague with AI-generated hate speech clip Encrypted email service files DMA complaint claiming it vanished from Google Search UK's Investigatory Powers Bill to become law despite tech world opposition Google location tracking deal could be derailed by politics The report incorporates input from the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which oversees privacy issues. A leaked draft of the ICO's Privacy Sandbox assessment earlier this week revealed that the ICO still believes the technology isn't living up to its name. And now those concerns have been publicly articulated. The CMA report lists almost 80 issues that have yet to be resolved to the satisfaction of UK regulators. ""The regulators are showing real concern about some significant areas – from latency and the role of cloud providers through to governance and privacy,"" said James Rosewell, co-founder of Movement for an Open Web, an advertising interest group, in a statement. ""These are fundamental issues that are not going to be addressed overnight. The fact that the issues list is growing as the technology gets closer is a sign that Google has tied itself up in knots that it simply can’t unwind."" Rosewell argues that Google has not put enough thought into the governance of the new ad regime being proposed – most competitors don't want Google giving itself new gatekeeping powers – and that competing ad targeting schemes should be able to compete fairly in an open market. Among the CMA's lingering worries about Google's technology, there's concern that the Topics interest-based ad mechanism doesn't explain itself well. ""We are concerned that the Topics consent user interface may not adequately inform users about how their personal data is used or how the topics generated may be used for purposes wider than interest-based advertising (e.g. as determined by organizations that decide to use the API),"" the report says, adding that Google is planning to revise the Topics API consent interface. There's also the possibility that Topics data about people's interests might be used for purposes other than advertising. ""Based on the ICO's preliminary assessment, we are concerned that topics data may be used for purposes outside that specified by the API, and in so doing may harm the user and breach Applicable Data Protection Legislation,"" the report says, while also observing that ""Google does acknowledge that entities calling the API might use the data for other purposes."" Another worry is that if the taxonomy of interests in the Topics API expands sufficiently, there will be a larger number of data points that may prove sufficient to identify people. ""We agree with the ICO that future utility-based changes to the taxonomy could introduce new privacy risks,"" the CMA report says. Web publishers have their own wish list of fixes, like a way to correct an errant Topics classification of a website and associated interests. The report also covers other APIs like the Protected Audience API and Fenced Frames. It's clear Google still has quite a bit of work left to do. Google said in a statement last week that it continues to expect the Privacy Sandbox to improve upon the not-very-private status quo. ""We've been closely engaging with the ICO, and other privacy and competition regulators globally, and will continue to do that to reach an outcome that works for users and the entire ecosystem,"" the biz said.

Back in 2019, Google introduced the ability to see 3D animals directly in Search. Using the web, Android, or iOS, you could see these 3D models and even use augmented reality (AR) on mobile devices to see those models in the real world, often at life-size. The collection of objects expanded over the years, at its peak offering upwards of 100 different animals, many dinosaurs, and educational models of planets, locations, human anatomy, parts of the cell, and more. You could even preview a car using 3D models. Google itself has never been good at cataloging these models, with a support page currently showing support for a handful of animals, cellular structures, and more. It’s a far cry from the list we’ve covered for the past few years now. But, suddenly, many of Google’s 3D models have simply disappeared. 3D animals and objects in Google Search have been drastically reduced, it seems, to a list that’s even shorter than what Google’s own official support page claims is available. There are barely a dozen animals available, and less than 10 remaining dogs and cats. Beyond that, there’s just a handful of insects and objects. In our testing, the list below represents 3D animals and objects still available in 2024. Google 3D animals that still work in 2024 Alpine goat Ball python Bumblebee (Moss Carder Bee) Cats: Bengal Cat Maine Coon Norwegian Forest Cat Ragdoll Scottish Fold Siamese Cat Dogs French Bulldog Pug Shiba Inu Donkey Dragon Easter bunny Great White Shark Hamster Insects: Stag Beetle Brown Cicada Ladybug Rosailia Batesi Swallowtail Butterfly Morpho Butterfly Hornet (Asian giant) Kookaburra Macaw Tiger Quokka Unicorn Locations, objects, etc Chauvet cave Taiko no Tatsujin Pac-Man Many of the various educational models of cells, body systems, and more are also still available, though body parts have been completely removed from Google’s collection of 3D models. Many are now shown as “interactive diagrams” in Search, though, rather than being referred to as 3D models. These include: Anatomical systems: Human digestive system, respiratory system, endocrine system, female reproductive system, nervous system, lymphatic system, male reproductive system, integumentary system, excretory system, peripheral nervous system, urinary system, skeletal system, muscular system, and circulatory system Cellular structures: Mitochondrion, prokaryote, endoplasmic reticulum, bacterium, eukaryote, plant cell, rough endoplasmic reticulum, nucleolus, flagellum, cell membrane, animal cell, Golgi apparatus, ribosomes, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, chromatin, nuclear membrane, fimbria, bacterial capsule, plasmids, central vacuole, cristae, plasma membrane, cell wall, and cisternae Chemistry: Functional group, Organic chemistry, Methyl acetate, Propanol, Salicylic acid, 1-Bromobutane, Hydrocarbon, Alkane, Electrolyte, Ionic bonding, Covalent bond, Chemical bond, Metallic bonding, Chemical compound, Ethene, Orbital hybridisation, and Quantum mechanical model Biology: Monocotyledon, Dicotyledon, Eukaryotic chromosome structure, Red blood cell, Monocyte, Neutrophil, Basophil, and Eosinophil Physics: Solenoid Google has not explained why so many of its 3D models were removed, but it’s easy to speculate that the ever-changing landscape around Search is likely to blame. Still, it’s a shame to see that so many of these have been removed, given their utility in educational, as well as the simple fact that they were fun to play around with. They also played a huge role in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the easy-to-access models went viral during lockdowns. Did you use Google’s 3D animals?

Ohanian and Huffman had raised $82,000 at that point and earned the confidence of Chris Sacca, Google's then-special initiatives lead. But the possible 2005 Google acquisition didn't happen. On Saturday, Ohanian explained why on Instagram, illustrating that Reddit's early decision to turn Google down ultimately came down to the scope of the offer and Google's plans for Reddit within its broader ecosystem. Sacca flew Ohanian and Huffman, who were the only two people working on Reddit at the time, out to Google headquarters. He introduced them to people at the company and had them eat at the Google cafeteria. ""Google is a dope place to be in 2005,"" Ohanian said. ""There were lots of companies that wanted to be like Google and it was tempting."" At the end of the day, Google's offer was ""just not significant"" and essentially an acqui-hire, or a way to bring Ohanian and Huffman on as Google employees, according to Ohanian. Related: Reddit Traffic Nearly Triples in 8 Months, Posts Rise to the Top of Google Search Google wanted to combine Reddit with YouTube, which Google intended to bring into the fold of its products at around that time, and have Reddit power YouTube comments.

Reasonable, given that the famous mascot is currently having a bit of a cultural moment. The only problem? Most of it was completely wrong. Over the weekend, Google Play’s X/Twitter account took it upon itself to make an impromptu Sonic The Hedgehog appreciation thread where the chili dog-eating hero gets older the more you scroll through it. But the Google Play’s scrapbook-esque thread's dabbling in historical revisionism of the blue hedgehog would spark a wave of corrections, even prompting Sega's own social media account to ask what was on every Sonic fan’s mind: What are you doing? Google Play’s Sonic-themed thread, which sporadically covers the blue blur’s evolution from 1991 to 2022, is now riddled with community notes criticizing the social media account for its litany of factual errors. 1991 Sonic. The cover? Rotund. Husky. Still fast as lightning. The actual game? 8-bit GLORY 🙌 pic.twitter.com/a2k2j9mvXH— Google Play (@GooglePlay) April 27, 2024 For instance, Google’s first threaded post of Sonic and Tails in 1991 is actually of Sonic’s 2013 mobile game. The key signifier of this error on Google Plays part is the fact that Tails isn’t Sonic’s companion in the original game. The post also refers to the original Sonic the Hedgehog as ""8-bit glory"" despite first releasing on the 16-bit Sega Genesis. And that's just the beginning. what are you doing— Sonic the Hedgehog (@sonic_hedgehog) April 28, 2024 Other blatant errors in Google Play’s thread include a screenshot of Sonic from 2014’s Sonic Boom cartoon saying this was the “short king” in 1993; a 2022 screenshot of Paramount Picture’s live-action Sonic that was actually from the 2020 movie, and a 2006 Sonic image from the 2017 mobile game Sonic Forces Mobile —which is available on the Google Play store. Fans went so far as to wonder if AI was used to create the strange thread, not the least because one of the images is poorly altered to remove background characters. 2022 Sonic.

Sonic has had quite a few design iterations since his debut on the Sega Genesis in 1991, and quite a few of those have even appeared in the Google Play Store. Despite that fact, it’s still a bit odd that Google Play decided to share a thread dedicated to Sonic the Hedgehog. The premise seemed simple enough – Sonic gets older in each tweet – but things fell apart immediately. As noted by @cnviolations, almost every tweet in the thread received a well-deserved Community Notes correction. Starting on a subtle note, an image shows an oddly cropped image of Sonic and Tails facing the wrecking ball boss battle in Green Hill Zone. However, Tails was not originally introduced until 1992’s Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Instead, this is the 2013 remake of the original game. We can almost forgive this error, as that iteration of the game is the one officially available in the Play Store. Unfortunately, the caption – besides being oddly written – also inaccurately refers to the game as being “8-bit GLORY.” While there was indeed an 8-bit companion game released that same year for Sega’s Master System and Game Gear, it’s clear they meant the Sega Genesis version, which was 16-bit. Going completely off the rails, Google Play’s next post talks about “1993 Sonic” with an image of the bescarfed design that debuted with Sonic Boom… in 2014. The following post, despite being labeled “1996 Sonic,” shows the “way past cool” hedgehog’s design from the 2020 movie as depicted in the mobile game Sonic Dash – hey, at least that’s a connection to the Play Store. The inaccuracies continue throughout the thread. Even once you get into the modern era, the post about “2020 Sonic” is noted to include a photo from 2022’s Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The included caption – “It was a strange year for us all let’s leave it at that” – almost works as a joke about both the pandemic and the utterly terrifying design that almost made it into the final film. Google Play’s final tweet, and easily the most quotable one, at least gets its core facts right by including a genuine image of “2022 Sonic” (albeit from an episode that debuted in 2024). However, the image is very clearly edited in an attempt to hide some of the background characters, and many are convinced that the edits were done by AI. Taken as a whole, there are two ways to think about this wild thread from Google Play. The prevailing thought in the community is that the whole thing was generated by an AI and not checked before publishing. Since AI is known to confidently spew inaccuracies, this could be a straightforward explanation. Alternatively, this could be some of the greatest engagement bait ever conceived. After all, what better way to get clicks and replies than to stir up the fervent Sonic the Hedgehog community? (It got me to write this post, after all.)

There is also a button there to update your Play Store install if it's not the latest version. We tested this with three games and the third game was shown as pending, so it seems like two is the limit for the number of simultaneous downloads. (Still twice as fast as it was before.)The new simultaneous downloads feature only works for fresh installs of new apps. Updates still perform as they did previously with the Play Store updating one at a time. As 9to5Google notes, the simultaneous downloads are likely being rolled out slowly to avoid any issues before expanding to the full scope of the Play Store.

Google fired me for standing against tech complicity in Gaza - The New Arab,Google fired me for standing against tech complicity in Gaza  The New Arab,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 18:03:04 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2FyYWIuY29tL29waW5pb24vZ29vZ2xlLWZpcmVkLW1lLXN0YW5kaW5nLWFnYWluc3QtdGVjaC1jb21wbGljaXR5LWdhemHSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdhcmFiLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2dvb2dsZS1maXJlZC1tZS1zdGFuZGluZy1hZ2FpbnN0LXRlY2gtY29tcGxpY2l0eS1nYXphP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The New Arab,"The software engineering job offer I received from Google came at the perfect time. I was in my senior year of college, lacking confidence and riddled with anxiety. The email from Google in my inbox validated all the years I spent studying. The hard work I had put into sharpening my coding skills had paid off, and I felt elated. When I started working at Google in August 2022, I remember sending my parents photos of the office and cherishing their amazement. I remember bringing friends in to try the food and to experience an office that was famous for feeling like a college campus. I loved seeing their smiles looking at the New York City Financial District skyline from the 14th-floor terrace. Google is famous for being a 'worker-friendly' workplace combining forward-thinking engineering with free food, massages, and even nap pods. How wrong that all turned out to be. A few months after I joined the company, my excitement about this job was shattered when I learned about Project Nimbus, Google’s and Amazon’s $1.2 billion cloud computing contract with the Israeli government. The details of the agreement were deeply unsettling: massive cloud server clusters of vague purpose would be built within the borders of Israel, where indigenous Palestinians are subject to military occupation and apartheid rule, routinely persecuted, dehumanized, displaced, and killed in an ongoing, state-sponsored process of ethnic cleansing aided by high tech infrastructure. Security and management of the clusters would be handed over to Palestine's occupier, potentially allowing the Israeli military free reign to use Google's technology however they wanted despite Google's repeated denials that are disputed even by Israel's military. October 7 and the Gaza genocide Worker dissent and public opinion objections to the deal were to be contractually ignored under the deal with Israel, despite clear evidence that the project would serve the goals of the Israeli military. To avoid criticism, Google would continuously deny the military nature of the contract for years even as Israel itself has said otherwise. When Israel began its medieval siege against Gaza over 200 days ago, my fears about working for Google intensified. It quickly became clear that Israel intended to commit a genocide and was leveraging artificial intelligence to enable it. To commit a massacre of this scale, data is as important as ammunition. The Israeli occupation boasts about the sophistication of its targeting systems, which are developed by training machine learning models on extensive data collected through invasive surveillance of Palestinians. Israel prefers striking targets while individuals are in their family homes, tracking Palestinians using automated systems with depraved names like “Where’s Daddy.” Merely returning home exposes Palestinians and their families to risk. When questioned about their preference for using conventional bombs over precision-guided weapons that could minimize civilian casualties, the Israeli military stated that they do not see the value in expending expensive munitions on “unimportant people.” In response to Israel’s crimes of genocide and collective punishment, Google has doubled down on their relationship with the Israeli military. From search engine to the military industrial complex As recently as a month ago, a Google contract proved direct services to the Israeli military, confirming that company leadership had been misleading workers for years regarding the military applications of Project Nimbus. In other words, Google workers are expected to develop technology that can be evidently used to streamline Israel’s genocide, and we are expected to remain silent about it. Once upon a time, Google’s slogan was “Don’t be evil.” They abandoned this motto in the last decade to transition into a glorified military contractor. What appeared to be an incredible job from the outside now resembles a dystopian adult daycare centre to me. The reality of working at Google is that it is a place where a chipper attitude, a false veneer of liberalism, and a collection of inconsequential, constantly shifting projects, are fervently promoted by Google’s propaganda to obscure the company’s business model that seem to include profiting from no-questions-asked militarisation that can enable genocide. With just a few public statements about how black lives matter, Google could pretend that it hadn’t - allegedly - made billions off of the destitution of black people in the Congo. With a tweet celebrating Indigenous People’s month, Google could unironically evade criticism for operating an office in Tel Aviv, a city built on the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Jaffa. Google mastered the song and dance of wokeness for the public, and internally, it keeps an iron grip on dissent. For years, I and other Googlers with the No Tech for Apartheid campaign opposed Project Nimbus within the company. We shared petitions, sent internal memos, and submitted ethics reviews. In response, we were doxxed, harassed, silenced, ignored then ultimately fired in order to ensure that Google's profits in occupied Palestine and the global military industry remained unchallenged. Many workers witnessed this repression, but company culture promotes fear and apathy over integrity. Google is two-faced. The colorful office, scooters, music rooms, and desserts all serve to distract from the backdrop of aggressive retaliation and a culture of fear. Google can only sustain profits from violence if it is able to ensure the complicity of its workers. And it is disheartening how some of the world’s brightest minds can be placated by comfort and used to increase wealth at the expense of human life. But make no mistake; Google is destined to fail. Workers are waking up to the reality of their exploitation, and our ability to stand against the unethical use of our labour is only growing stronger. Abuse and oppression are unsustainable in the long term. Today, on Wall Street, Google’s ticker symbol sits next to an upward green arrow—business has been prosperous for the profiteers of genocide. But workers play a critical role in the growing movement for liberation, and we will not forget Google’s complicity. Justice will prevail. Have questions or comments?

Hidden behind the scenes in Google Contacts v4.30.50.628193927, the app is working on a new page for adding a new contact to the app. This new page is simplified considerably from the existing design, and is does so by hiding fields that aren’t used on all contacts. By default, the page simply asks for a name, company, and phone number. You can also add a picture at the top easily. Once that base information is added, you can then add additional phone numbers, an email address, a “significant date” (like a birthday or anniversary), an address, and notes. There’s a further overflow menu for fields such as a middle name, pronunciation, job title, and more. All of the functionality here is existing, but the new design makes it much easier to use. The UI was first shown off by Android Authority, and we were also able to enable it using a method shared by @AssembleDebug on Twitter/X. However, the new design is not rolling out just yet.

At a press conference for the groundbreaking of Google’s new data center, Gov. Eric Holcomb, Indiana Secretary of Commerce David Rosenberg and company executives shared the $2 billion investment is expected to create 200 new jobs. As part of Google’s initial investments in the Fort Wayne community, the company is contributing $250,000 to the new Fort Wayne Early Learning Center and Just Neighbors Interfaith Homeless Network. Google also made commitments to bring its Skilled Trades and Readiness Program or STAR to Fort Wayne through a partnership with Ivy Tech Community College. Google also announced a collaboration with Indiana Michigan Power (I&M), which will help bring new clean energy resources to the area and support Google’s efforts to run all of its 13 nationwide data centers on carbon-free energy. Fort Wayne Mayor Sharon Tucker says she’s excited about what Google’s investment means for the city. “A week ago on Friday my name was Councilwoman Tucker and I cheered for this because I know what it will do for this district where it's located. And now as Mayor Tucker, I'm extremely excited because I know what it will do for our city as a whole.” Sen. Tod Young says this collaboration with Google is just one of the many projects that will make Indiana a critical part of the digital infrastructure of the 21st century and will help attract more opportunities in the future. “From AI to personal computing to GPS, this is a data-driven world. A point others have emphasized, but is increasingly evident as we watch this hyper-dynamic, hyper-dependent economy evolve. Indiana's a critical part, I believe, in this digital infrastructure of the 21st century economy.” Data centers owned by Google power its digital services like Google Cloud, Gmail.

Study: 56% of Google's top three positions are held by ccTLDs - Search Engine Land,Study: 56% of Google's top three positions are held by ccTLDs  Search Engine Land,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc2VhcmNoZW5naW5lbGFuZC5jb20vc3R1ZHktNTYtb2YtZ29vZ2xlcy10b3AtdGhyZWUtcG9zaXRpb25zLWFyZS1oZWxkLWJ5LWNjdGxkcy00Mzk5ODjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Search Engine Land,"Getting international SEO right is hugely important for global brands. And one of the most fundamental optimizations is the domain and URL structure you choose to use. While Google offers guidelines for using locale-specific URLs, SEO information on the topic is limited and sometimes confusing. Many SEOs tend to advise using ccTLDs in each market if you have the resources. Others argue for subdirectories with a gTLD. Heaven help anyone who says subdomains are just as viable. Spoiler alert: our data suggests they might be. So, we recently released our study on domain structures for international SEO to add some data to this conversation. At the very least, we wanted to understand how popular different domain structures were. We also hoped our analysis might reveal some secrets about how Google’s algorithm responds to different domain structures internationally. Below are our key findings. 1. 56% of the top three positions are held by ccTLDs Our data reveals that ccTLDs are the most prevalent website structure in the top three ranking positions globally. This suggests those who favor ccTLDs are right to do so. However, ccTLDs can be expensive and inefficient to manage, so take this into consideration and choose them only if you are confident they are the right solution for you. 2. The prevalence of ccTLDs and gTLDs in SERP positions are inversely correlated gTLDs with no market subdomains or subdirectories are inversely correlated with ccTLDs as you go from position 1 to 100. Perhaps this is just a coincidence, but it indicates that Google does not favor websites with no discernable geotargeting for that market. 3. Subdirectories are the second most prevalent website structure in the top three positions Subdirectories appear in over 20% of Google’s top positions and account for around 20% of all SERP positions, reflecting that they are a popular choice. 4. Subdomains account for just 3% of domain structures in SERPs but are only prevalent in top positions in multilingual markets Switzerland represented the only multilingual market in our study, and it’s the only country where subdomains are prevalent in the top three positions. For French keywords in Swiss SERPs, subdomains outperformed subdirectories. For Italian keywords, the opposite was true. 5. Portugal is the only market where subdirectories are more common in the top three positions than ccTLDs Portugal bucked the global trend and was the only market where subdirectories more commonly ranked in the top three positions than ccTLDs. Filipa Silva, a Portuguese SEO specialist, said: “This data reflects the fact that there aren’t many very big Portuguese brands who are able to compete with multi-national brands who are using subdirectory structures. For example, brands like Pull and Bear, Zara and Calzedonia all perform incredibly when it comes to fashion keywords with subdirectory structures.” 6. Czechia has the highest rate of ccTLDs in Google SERPs Of all the countries analyzed, ccTLD websites dominate Czechia’s SERPs. Almost 90% of the top three positions were taken by .cz ccTLDs. Even combining .us and .com together in the U.S. results in fewer ccTLDs (83%) than in Czechia (84%). Iryna Melnyk, a Czech SEO specialist, said: “Many big brands tend to either choose not to translate their content into the Czech language or use poor translation services, which we can see right through. And this is such a shame, suggesting that there is a big opportunity for multi-national brands to translate their content better into an optimized format for the Czech market.” 7. In Austria, .AT ccTLDs inversely correlate with German ccTLDs German ccTLDs (.de) account for almost 20% of all top positions in Austria. By contrast, Austrian ccTLDs make up less than 1% of all domain structures in Germany. We only found three Austrian ccTLDs in the top three positions of German SERPs. Tatjana Batjaev, a German SEO specialist, said: “Given the size of the populations and their economies, this data comes as no surprise in general. Lots of German brands sell directly into Austria via .DE domains, but there are nuances in language and we’d always recommend localizing content into an Austrian dialect as best practice.” Dig deeper: International SEO: How to avoid common translation and localization pitfalls 8. The popularity of .com means the U.S. is a statistical anomaly for gTLD use The overwhelming popularity of the .com domain in the U.S. market means it is very rare to see the official .us ccTLD in use. Melina Lyraki, an SEO specialist from the U.S., said: “.com domains are ubiquitous in the U.S. market, and many people just assume .com is U.S.’s ccTLD. Given how popular it is, it is probably the only market where we would ever recommend using a gTLD (.com) ahead of the country’s ccTLD when advising brands who are only targeting the U.S. market.” What does this data mean for your international SEO strategy? This data supports those who think ccTLDs are the best for International SEO. If you choose that route, just remember that they require more resources to build, maintain and optimize than other options. Evidence from the Swiss market suggests that subdomains can be just as effective as any other domain structure. Perhaps we shouldn’t always be so quick to discount the long-maligned subdomain. That said, it’s clear that subdirectory structures are more commonly used and found in the top organic positions than subdomains. Whichever strategy you choose, remember that this is just your starting point for success. Study methodology GA Agency worked with our partners at SE Ranking to analyse 20,000 keywords across 15 different markets, counting how often each website structure appears in each Google position from 1-100. In total, over 1.7 million SERP positions were analyzed. We looked at ccTLDs, gTLDs with subdomains, gTLDs with subdirectories and gTLDs without evidence of market-specific subdomains or subdirectories. We did not include website structures using URL parameters in this study, as they are not recommended. We analyzed ~1,400 keywords in each market. We used transactional or purchase intent e-commerce keywords across all languages (defined as such by analyzing the sites ranking in the top 10 positions). Markets analyzed: Austria, Switzerland (German, French and Italian-speaking regions), Czechia, Germany, Spain, France, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States.",https://searchengineland.com/wp-content/seloads/2024/04/Study-56-of-Googles-top-three-positions-are-held-by-ccTLDs.png,2024-04-29,0.05,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Calzedonia', 'description': 'Italian lingerie company', 'full_name': 'Calzedonia', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Calzedonia%2C_Oxford_Street%2C_London%2C_March_2016_01.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SEO', 'latitude': 35.30997085571289, 'longitude': 73.23993682861328, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SERP', 'latitude': 52.86722183227539, 'longitude': 34.954368591308594, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Switzerland', 'latitude': 47.000160217285156, 'longitude': 8.014269828796387, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Portugal', 'latitude': 39.5, 'longitude': -8.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bear', 'latitude': 43.56224060058594, 'longitude': -93.49320220947266, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Zara', 'latitude': 34.821388244628906, 'longitude': 71.85221862792969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Czechia', 'latitude': 49.75, 'longitude': 15.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Austria', 'latitude': 47.33332824707031, 'longitude': 13.333330154418945, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Germany', 'latitude': 51.5, 'longitude': 10.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'International', 'latitude': 51.157958984375, 'longitude': 0.864870011806488, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Spain', 'latitude': 40.0, 'longitude': -4.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'France', 'latitude': 46.0, 'longitude': 2.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hungary', 'latitude': 47.0, 'longitude': 20.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Italy', 'latitude': 42.83332824707031, 'longitude': 12.833330154418945, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Japan', 'latitude': 35.685359954833984, 'longitude': 139.7530975341797, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Poland', 'latitude': 52.0, 'longitude': 20.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Russia', 'latitude': 60.0, 'longitude': 100.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sweden', 'latitude': 62.0, 'longitude': 15.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Turkey', 'latitude': 39.05900955200195, 'longitude': 34.91154861450195, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United Kingdom', 'latitude': 54.75843811035156, 'longitude': -2.695310115814209, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",I don t know,"Google's guidelines for international SEO domain structures suggest using locale-specific URLs.

It comes joined by the first-ever deal on Samsung’s recently-refreshed Galaxy Tab S6 Lite at $250 – complete with upgraded specs. Plus, you can drop Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag 2 down to $17 each when you buy four. Hit the jump for all that and more in the latest 9to5Toys Lunch Break. First discount in months has Google Pixel Watch 2 starting at $300 Amazon is now offering the Google Pixel Watch 2 for $300. This is $50 off the usual $350 price tag and the first price in months. It does match that previous mention from the beginning of February but is otherwise the second-best offer to date at within $14 of the all-time low from the holiday shopping season last year. You can also save on cellular LTE models at $330, down from $400. Keep reading for all of the details, and we also walked away with a favorable opinion in our hands-on review, too. The new Pixel Watch 2 debuts as Google’s second-generation fitness tracking experience. While the same design remains as before, there’s now an all-new heart rate sensor on the inside that comes powered by Fitbit’s updated AI for better insight into your overall health. Longer battery life is another perk, upping wear time to 24 hours with its always-on display. Google powers the whole package with the new Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chip and its 4nm prowess, which we noted was a significant upgrade over the original model. This discounted model comes with one of Google’s standard silicone bands, too. There’s a full array of colors available for both the straps and the exterior casing. Samsung just brought back its Galaxy Tab S6 Lite with upgraded specs Amazon is now offering the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) tablet for $250. This drops the Wi-Fi 64GB configuration down from its usual $330 price tag for the very first time. Samsung just announced the refreshed tablet earlier in the month as an Amazon exclusive, and now the retailer is taking $80 off to deliver a new all-time low. The higher-capacity 128GB model is also on sale for $80 off, now dropping to $320 from its usual $400 going rate. Not to be confused with the original model that launched back in 2020 or its predessor from 2022, this more recent iteration from Samsung was just updated with some new tricks up its sleeve. The third time does in fact seem to be the charm, as Samsung is back with another take on the same form-factor as before. There’s a metal housing surrounding the 10.4-inch touchscreen display. The biggest change, however, for the Galaxy Tab S6 is the new Exynos 1280 chip that upgrades the previous Snapdragon 720G chip. Shipping with Android 14 out of the box, other features like the included S Pen make this a mid-range solution to Samsung’s higher-end offerings. We take an even closer look at what’s new in our launch coverage. Drop Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag 2 down to $17 each when you buy 4 Amazon is now offering a 4-pack of Samsung’s latest SmartTag 2 Item Finders for $70. This bundle would typically set you back $100. Now, you can save $30 and score the best price to date. It beats our previous mention by an extra $2 and is only the second time it has ever dropped this low. While Android users are still waiting for Google to release its Find My Device network, Samsung smartphone owners don’t have to wait to keep tabs on their gear thanks to these new Galaxy SmartTag 2. Samsung’s new second-generation item finder just hit the scene in the first few days of October and arrives as the company’s second take on Apple’s AirTags. The revamped design now supports both Bluetooth and ultra-wideband (UWB) connectivity. That updated design is far more friendly for clipping onto bags, keys, suitcases – and really anything else – with a ring integrated right into the form-factor. It’s backed by an IP67 water-resistance rating and boasts a battery that can last for upwards of 700 days. Hisense 55-inch 144Hz U7 mini-LED Google TV hits $650 While Hisense is still offering up to $200 in official NBA gift cards with select 2023 models, Best Buy is now offering a deep price drop on its brand new 2024 Google smart TVs alongside the bonus credit. You can now score the latest Hisense 55-inch Class U7 Series mini-LED 4K QLED Google TV for $650. Regularly $800, this is $150 off the going rate on the brand new release and the lowest we can find. This same TV is selling for $830 directly from Amazon right now. Alongside the included value of the NBA gift card, you’re looking at $200 in savings on the latest 55-inch U7 Google TV from the brand. The Hisense 55-inch Class U7 delivers a 4K mini-LED panel with the 144Hz rate the brand has become known for. From there, you’ll find Dolby Vision, HDR 10+, HDR 10, Hybrid Log-Gamma, FreeSync Premium Pro (AMD Adaptive Sync), Apple AirPlay casting, a pair of HDMI 2.1 inputs (four total), and Wi-Fi 6E router compatibility. New Amazon low knocks $150 off Razer’s Edge Wi-Fi Gaming Tablet Amazon is now offering its best price yet on the Razer Edge Wi-Fi Gaming Tablet at $250. This model debuted late last year at $400 and is now seeing a sizable 38% price drop. This $150 in savings is the best we have tracked yet on Amazon, coming in at $50 under our previous mention to deliver a new all-time low there. Razer’s Edge Wi-Fi Gaming Tablet features a 6.8-inch FHD Plus (2,400 x 1,080) OLED screen to provide an on-the-go solution for Android, PC, Xbox, and other cloud gaming services that doesn’t require your handset like the brand’s more affordable Kishi mobile phone controllers. Joining the 144Hz OLED display, the Razer Edge Wi-Fi Gaming Tablet is powered by a Snapdragon G3X Gen 1 processor with an active-cooled gaming chipset. Joining Bluetooth 5.2, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, microswitch buttons, analog triggers, programmable macros, and Razer HyperSense haptics, it also features direct access to the Razer Nexus dashboard for Android gaming – “launch games, explore recommendations, capture gameplay pictures and videos, or livestream gaming to the world” – but also works with Xbox Cloud Gaming and services.

Google announced that in 2023, they have prevented 2.28 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play. This amazing result was possible thanks to the introduction of enhanced security features, policy updates, and advanced machine learning and app review processes. Additionally, Google Play strengthened its developer onboarding and review procedures, requesting a more accurate identification during account setup. These efforts resulted in the ban of 333,000 accounts for confirmed malware and repeated severe policy breaches. Google also rejected or remediated approximately 200K app submissions to ensure proper use of sensitive permissions such as background location or SMS access. Google has closely worked with SDK providers to protect users’ privacy and prevent sensitive data access and sharing. Over 31 SDKs have enhanced their posture impacting 790K+ apps. “We also significantly expanded the Google Play SDK Index, which now covers the SDKs used in almost 6 million apps across the Android ecosystem.” states Google. “This valuable resource helps developers make better SDK choices, boosts app quality and minimizes integration risks.” Google continues to work on improving the Android environment. In November, 2023, it moved the App Defense Alliance (ADA) under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, with Meta, Microsoft, and Google as founding steering members. The Alliance encourages widespread adoption of best practices and guidelines for app security across the industry, while also developing countermeasures to address emerging security threats. Google enhanced Google Play Protect’s security capabilities to provide stronger protection for users installing apps from outside the Play Store. The company implemented real-time scanning at the code-level to detect new malicious apps. The company revealed that this measure has already identified over 5 million new malicious apps outside of the Play Store, enhancing Android users’ global security.

An announcement via new documentation advises that publishers can no longer manually add their sites to be considered for Google News but existing publishers will continue to have access to customization features but that those too will be removed soon. Google Publisher Center The Google Publisher Center was a service that allows publishers to submit their site content to Google News. Publishers could also submit a constantly updated feed that would alert Google to newly published articles. Google could also use a sitemap to discover newly published news articles. While Google offered publishers a way to submit webpages to Google for display in Google News, Google never promised to show those sites. Google also has maintained that they had automated ways to include content into Google News. Google News Inclusion System Google removed the ability for publishers to manually submit websites to be considered for inclusion to Google News. The process is transitioning to a fully automated system of discovery and inclusion. The new system will be rolling out later this year. The “Submit your publication for review” documentation was removed and is replaced with a 404 response webpage. New Documentation Google’s new documentation explains that publishers will be unable to do manual submissions and that current publishers will continue to have access to the submission tools but that those tools will be removed some time later in 2024. From the new Publisher Center documentation: “Starting today, publishers can no longer add publications to the Publisher Center. We are making this change as part of a transition to roll out automatically created publication pages later this year.” The new documentation further explains that current publishers with access to the Publisher Center will continue to have access to customization features but that access will at some point be removed. “What’s next for publication pages? By adding a publication to Publisher Center, publishers were able to manually create a source page for users to follow. Publishers with manually created publication pages will continue to have access to customization features until later this year, when pages will shift to being automatically created. Users will continue to be able to follow their favorite publications.” SearchLiaison Explains Reasons For Change Google SearchLiaison posted this explanation on X (formerly known as Twitter): “To clarify (some people get this, I know — but others get confused)…. Content is automatically considered for Google News and news surfaces, as has been the case since Dec. 2019. That hasn’t changed. Publisher Center offered a way to create source pages manually, which did not somehow get content overall considered for Google News and news surfaces. Some who made these pages would get confused and think source page = content in Google News and news surfaces. We’ve tried to clarify this more over the years… Despite that, some still get confused because … yeah, it’s confusing! So part of this change is eliminating that confusion. Sites small and big are still automatically considered… Also, anticipating those who say we should do more to include more news sites — moving to automatic consideration has helped, versus the past where someone would actually have to know to apply. That said, yes, there’s always more we can do — it’s something I push on (and I’m not alone) especially in cases where sites are not having their content appear at all in news queries but are referenced by other who do. I’d really like to see us improve with this.” How Sites Can Be Included In Google News Sites wishing to be included into Google News need to abide by Google’s Content policies. Google then uses algorithmic signals to determine eligibility for being shown in Google News as well as in additional Google News surfaces such as Top Stories and the News Tab in the Search Results. Google News Ranking Signals Understanding the ranking signals Google uses for Google News is more important now than ever before. Google lists general factors as part of the Google News ranking signals and a separate group of factors for personalized news (this is the “For You” tab of Google News).

Bay Area tech layoffs: Google cuts hit several development teams - San Francisco Chronicle,Bay Area tech layoffs: Google cuts hit several development teams  San Francisco Chronicle,"Tue, 30 Apr 2024 01:18:03 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc2ZjaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL3RlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZS9nb29nbGUtbGF5b2Zmcy1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC10ZWFtcy0xOTQyOTg4My5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,San Francisco Chronicle,"Google has trimmed staff within various development teams in its latest round of layoffs, a spokesperson for the Mountain View tech giant confirmed on Monday. Although Google did not provide a specific headcount, the company filed a WARN notice with California authorities on April 24, indicating plans to eliminate 50 positions. The layoffs reportedly impacted members of teams such as Flutter, Dart and Python, according to TechCrunch, which first reported the news. The spokesperson reiterated a statement shared during previous layoffs: “As we’ve said, we’re responsibly investing in our company’s biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead. To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers and align their resources to their biggest product priorities.” Earlier in January, Google announced it would lay off 702 workers in the Bay Area. Additionally, Google’s YouTube division reduced its workforce by 100. CEO Sundar Pichai indicated that further layoffs were anticipated through 2024. Many employees affected by the latest round of layoffs shared their experiences on social media, suggesting that the cuts would have a broad impact across the company. “We’re sad, but still cranking hard on I/O and beyond,” Kevin Moore, a project manager with Google, wrote in the Flutter development community on Reddit. “We know y'all care SO MUCH about the project and the team and the awesome ecosystem we’ve built together. You’re nervous. I get it. We get it. You’re betting on Flutter and Dart. So am I. So is Google.” Flutter helps developers make apps for mobile phones, computers and the internet, using the programming language Dart. Python provides a programming language for web and software development, allowing users to automate tasks and analyze data. Thomas Wouters, a member of the Python Steering Council, signaled the layoffs in a social media post last week. He indicated the Bay Area team was replaced by one based in Munich. “It’s a tough day when everyone you work with directly, including your manager, is laid off — excuse me, ‘had their roles reduced,’ and you’re asked to onboard their replacements, people told to take those very same roles just in a different country who are not any happier about it,” he wrote on Mastodon. Employees affected by the layoffs can apply for other open positions within the company. Google is scheduled to hold its annual developers’ conference at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View from May 14-15.

This will effectively lessen the app's clutter, which would ask for and deliver more important details regarding a new or existing contact that one will save on their devices. With this user-centric redesign, Google Contacts is putting your needs first. The update will deliver direct information, prioritizing the essential details that matter most to you. It's a testament to Google's commitment to improving your contact management experience. Google Contacts Redesign to Bring Less Clutter Assemble Debug, a renowned tipster , shared with Android Authority that they found an upcoming update for Google Contacts that would make its design less cluttered for users on Android. This redesign is rolling out with the latest version of the app, v4.30.50.628193927, and it makes it more straightforward compared to its previous interface. Instead of being bombarded with various fields, it goes directly to the point where users are asked about the first and last name, company, phone number, and email address fields to fill out. After that, users may add other important information like birthdays or any other 'significant date,' addresses, and labels that would fit the person. Read Also: Separate Google Account Required for Android's Private Space? Report Says Yes Direct Info for Google Contacts on Android Apart from the four fields of focus, Google Contacts also added the Notes text box for direct information about the contact that users are trying to save to better understand the person. Android's experience on Google Contacts saw a streamlined update dedicated to removing clutter and making it more direct-to-the-point, avoiding previous information that may not be relevant to a user. It also adds a new Favorite button to designate a top contact, as well as an 'Add Field' button that allows a user to customize additional information to follow up. Android and Google Apps Development Android is known for sporting built-in apps directly from Google, similar as to how Apple brings native apps to the iPhone, alongside massive experiences thanks to operating system updates. Late last year, Google offered a feature on the Play Store regarding a way to uninstall apps on their Android devices remotely, through another Android smartphone or tablet under the same Google account. Various Google apps are available to enjoy on Android, including Maps, Gmail, Google Translate, and more. Among the most used are Google Messages, the RCS-enabled messaging platform. It recently brought an update that offers a new creative way of expressing themselves to receivers, with the new selfie GIFs that can create animated clips that match what they want to send. Google prides itself on the many apps and experiences available right off the bat from an Android smartphone, particularly for devices that mainly rely on these, like Xiaomi, Realme, and more. This update for Google Contacts offers a redesign of its interface that prioritizes direct information and less clutter, optimizing the experience on Android more.

"With 10 Words, Google Head of Search Prabhakar Raghavan Just Taught a Profound Lesson About Success - Inc.","With 10 Words, Google Head of Search Prabhakar Raghavan Just Taught a Profound Lesson About Success  Inc.","Sat, 27 Apr 2024 09:59:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmMuY29tL21pbmRhLXpldGxpbi93aXRoLTEwLXdvcmRzLWdvb2dsZS1oZWFkLW9mLXNlYXJjaC1wcmFiaGFrYXItcmFnaGF2YW4tanVzdC10YXVnaHQtYS1wcm9mb3VuZC1sZXNzb24tYWJvdXQtc3VjY2Vzcy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Inc.,"Last month, Google senior vice president Prabhakar Raghavan called an all-hands meeting for the company's search employees to talk about the future. What he had to say was sobering, but he accompanied his message with a call-to-arms designed to inspire his employees to put in their best effort and face the future with optimism and determination. Whatever happens with Google search, his comments are a lesson in how to motivate the people who work for you to reach for success, even when dealing with recent failures. What do you say to your team when your own errors, uncontrollable outside forces, or a combination of both leads to business results that weren't what you hoped for? You acknowedge the problem, regroup, and ask people to focus on the future. That's exactly what Raghavan did in two simple sentences: ""I cannot tell you that all the stumbles are behind us. What matters is how we respond and what we learn."" What matters is how we respond and what we learn. It's a reminder we all need when failures hit, or market forces turn against us. Yes, things will go wrong, due to factors we can't control or our own mistakes--in Google's case there seems to be some of both. The most important question is what we do afterward, and whether we can use those failures as a way to start building future success. Google search growth has slowed. In this case, we're not talking about a business disaster, we're talking about slowing growth in search. But for Google, that's very much a cause for alarm. Search is, of course, Google's core product and one where it has dominated its market pretty much since the company's founding. That dominance, and the extraordinary growth of search, is part of what allowed Google to be the famously generous place to work it has traditionally been. But times are changing. Search growth is slowing--perhaps because Google got more than 91 percent of the search market over the past decade and there's no longer much room for growth. On top of that, generative artificial intelligence is upending the very nature of search, providing results in narrative form. And Raghavan faces intense criticism from some outside the company both for ousting Google's longtime search leader Ben Gomes and for allegedly sacrificing the quality of search results in pursuit of increased ad revenue that may or may not even be possible. All in all, the future growth of search, Google's formerly dependable cash cow, now seems a bit murky. And that's exactly the message Raghavan delivered. Things have changed in the past couple of decades, he acknowledged. ""It's not like life is going to be hunky-dory forever,"" he said in a recording of the event obtained by CNBC. ""If there's a clear and present market reality, we need to twitch faster, like the athletes twitch faster."" He described the three months since the last all-hands meeting as ""really high highs and low lows."" But, at least from outside Google, the lows seemed to predominate. There was yet another round of layoffs, despite a solid quarterly report. Ad revenue was down, causing a drop in the company's stock price. And, most famously, the company released an AI image generating feature that it had to temporarily withdraw due to errors that apparently resulted from an attempt to build in racial sensitivity--a blunder that led to public apologies from both Raghavan and CEO Sundar Pichai. Future growth will be 'hard earned.' Raghavan praised the AI team who he said worked 120 hours a week and managed to fix most of the image-generating problems in just 10 days. But then he warned that fighting the AI wars with rivals like Microsoft necessarily meant investing heavily in hardware to provide the expanded computing power AI requires. ""We're in a new cost reality,"" he said. And on the revenue side, he said, the growth of new devices coming online, and thus new search customers, was slowing. ""What that means is our growth in this new operating reality has to be hard earned,"" he said. Put it all together, and he was telling his team to expect difficult times ahead. But, he said, ""These are the moments and the history of industries that will define us."" Will Raghavan's speech really be enough to change things for Google search? Only time will tell. But it was an inspiring, if distressing message, designed to inspire his team to try harder and beat some difficult odds. Whether it works or not, it's a great model to follow when tough times come calling for your own company.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/w_1024,h_576,c_fill/images/panoramic/prabhakar-raghavan-google-inc-1933428241_540227_f74eic.jpg",2024-04-27,0.106,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Prabhakar Raghavan', 'description': 'businessperson', 'full_name': 'Prabhakar Raghavan', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Prabhakar_Raghavan.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",I don t know,Google's search growth has slowed due to market saturation and AI advancements.

Google is preparing a new update for Contacts that will rework the user experience surrounding its ""create"" page. As detailed by AssembleDebug at Android Authority, Google's upcoming 4.30.50.62 build for the Contacts refreshes the ""create contact"" page by shoving the necessities front and center. There's also a convenient ""Favorite"" star icon at the top of the page. Users will soon find boxes for a person's first name, last name, company, and phone number directly below the ""Add picture"" option. After, Google chucks away the rest of the text box fields in favor of a few pill-shaped buttons. Contacts will display a few auxiliary options for adding an email, ""significant date,"" address, or a ""label."" Additionally, Contacts provides loads of extra fields that will soon slide into an ""Add Fields"" button at the very bottom of the redesigned page. The deep dive shows that tapping the option produces a floating menu from the bottom of the UI, containing fields like middle name, prefix, suffix, nickname, and more. Lastly, when creating new contacts, Google seems to draw more attention to the ""Notes"" field. The redesign's early preview shows the text box is much larger as it finishes the original list of available contact options before adding more. The change to the creation page for Google Contacts should streamline the user experience. Currently, the page displays everything as a mundane list full of fields you probably aren't interested in filling out. Now, the redesign only shows what matters most alongside the option of adding a field of your choosing. A ""more fields"" option exists on the current (old) Contacts view, but it throws everything in, adding to its clutter. These changes should arrive as a Play Store update for Google Contacts under the 4.30 build. However, as the publication notes, it hasn't started rolling out yet. The company has been slowly reworking the experience Contacts gives users and its most recent one rolled out in March. The update dropped the app's old navigation drawer as Google slowly moves away from the UI design trend. A drop-down menu beneath the search bar lets users quickly customize their view. There's also a custom ringtone page tucked into the ""Fix & manage"" tab.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ck7DwfybeZXMyjmw6MBEXJ.jpg,2024-04-29,-0.041,[],I don t know,"Google Contacts is getting an update that redesigns the ""create contact"" page with a less overwhelming design.

Perhaps one of the most popular AI-based features is Circle to Search. It first came to the Galaxy S24 series of phones and has since launched on Google's beloved Pixel line of devices. And while it's definitely a popular feature, it's not without flaws. One flaw, though, is going to be fixed. According to a report from Android Authority, which was found by digging through the Pixel Launcher app bundled with the recently released Android 15 Beta 1.2 update, Google is working on bringing split-screen support to Circle to Search. Tucked in the release is a flag that lets users take advantage of the feature while in split-screen mode, making it far more helpful. On Samsung Galaxy phones that support the advanced AI feature, the Circle to Search in split-screen restriction doesn't seem to be an issue, so this update only addresses Pixel phones. It seems weird that Google would build a restriction like not being able to use Circle to Search on its own devices on purpose, so it could be a bug that creeped its way in somewhere during development. Either way, this has been a gripe for Pixel owners who want to use more than one app while still having a quick way to search for something on their phones. When Android 15 comes out (which is expected to happen in the first quarter of 2024) all users will be able to take advantage of Circle to Search in the phone's split screen mode.

The enhancements give advertisers more granular control over their campaigns, improve customer insights, and manage budgets better. 🆕 ✅Several #PMax updates announced today for more insights, goals and control. Here are the highlights: – New Customer Value mode is now in beta for purchase conversion goals. New customer acquisition goals are also now available in #SA360. – Customer retention goal to win… — AdsLiaison (@adsliaison) April 29, 2024 New Customer Value Mode & Acquisition Goals Google Ads has introduced Customer Value mode, currently in beta, designed for purchase conversion goals. This update allows advertisers to focus on high-value customers and optimize their campaigns accordingly. Additionally, new customer acquisition goals are now available in Search Ads 360 (SA360), enabling businesses to target and attract new customers. Winning Back Lapsed Customers Google Ads has launched a customer retention goal (in beta) to help advertisers win back lapsed customers. This feature enables businesses to re-engage with inactive customers, potentially increasing customer loyalty and retention rates. Detailed Demographics & Audience Insights Performance Max now offers detailed demographics, including age and gender groups, in its audience insights. This update gives advertisers a more nuanced understanding of their target audience, enabling them to create more targeted and effective campaigns. Budget Pacing Insights & Forecasting To help advertisers better manage their budgets, Google Ads has introduced budget pacing insights. These insights provide projected campaign spend and forecasted conversion performance. This feature allows businesses to make informed decisions about their budget allocation and optimize their campaigns for maximum ROI. Account-Level IP Address Exclusions Performance Max now supports account-level IP address exclusions, giving advertisers greater control over their campaigns and enabling them to exclude specific IP addresses from their targeting. Advertisers can refer to the official Google Ads blog post for more information on these updates and how to leverage them for improved campaign performance. Testing Optimization Strategies Perhaps the most intriguing update is the ability to run experiments testing optimization strategies directly within Performance Max campaigns. The first strategy being tested is “Final URL expansion,” which dynamically points ads to the most relevant landing page. According to Google data cited: “Advertisers who use Final URL expansion with Performance Max campaigns see an average increase of over 9% in conversions/conversion value at a similar Cost Per Action (CPA)/Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).” The experiments will split traffic, with a portion dedicated to testing while tracking performance against the original setup. Data will “reveal how this change impacts your campaign’s performance.” Why SEJ Cares These updates demonstrate Google Ads’ ongoing commitment to providing advertisers with tools and insights to succeed in an increasingly competitive market. The ability to optimize for different customer lifecycle stages, test optimization strategies, and detect audience opportunities are all valuable enhancements. Performance Max is Google’s future for performance marketing, so staying up-to-date on new features and best practices is critical. How This Can Help You The new customer lifetime value and retention goals could open up strategies to better nurture customers through the entire marketing funnel from acquisition to repeat purchases. More sophisticated audience insights about age and gender may highlight opportunities to tailor messaging better. Running optimization experiments could unlock unique performance gains, especially if utilizing the dynamic Final URL expansion option. Taking advantage of these new controls and insights within Performance Max could improve marketers’ efficiency and return on investment.

Discovery, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global utilizing its Disney & Video 360 advertising tool. Google’s Kristin O’Hara, VP, agency, platforms and client solutions, announced that the tech company is one of the first partners to directly integrate with the Disney Real-Time Ad Exchange (DRAX). “This is going to allow you to reach relevant audiences across the entire Disney portfolio at more meaningful moments with increased speed, accuracy and flexibility,” she said. With a new tool expansion, she added, “You’re soon going to be able to select whatever inventory you want across Disney’s portfolio as well as YouTube guaranteed and non-guaranteed, all on DV360.” She also touted Google’s Publisher Advertiser Identity Reconciliation (PAIR) “identity solution” giving advertisers and publishers “a new way to power campaigns using first-party data.” It is live with NBCUniversal and is coming soon to Disney through DRAX, she said. Google and the IAB Tech Lab are partnering on an effort to open-source PAIR to the industry so “our industry as a whole can adopt privacy-forward solutions that are going to benefit everyone,” she said. “This is a win for the industry, because we believe the future of privacy will be built in partnership,” she said. Paramount’s Pete Chelala, VP, programmatic advertising sales, and Warner Bros. Discovery’s Jill Steinhauser, SVP, ad sales and revenue operations, joined O’Hara onstage. “Behaviors are changing, patterns are changing, measurement is changing but what hasn’t changed is just the fundamentals of content,” Chelala said. “It’s just gotta be good.” “It all goes back to the content,” Steinhauser said. Sean Downey, president, Americas and global partners, Google, noted that streaming has become synonymous with TV. “We’ve been seeing a major shift in how people watch what they love,” he said. “That means how advertisers connect with streaming audiences has also changed and in 2024 it’s reaching a tipping point. The explosion of streaming has redefined what people even mean when they say they are going to watch TV.” “As audiences have fragmented so has your ability to reach them,” he noted, at the event highlighting Google’s ad solutions.",https://mediaplaynews.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Google-shutterstock.jpg,2024-04-29,0.0,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Paramount Global', 'description': 'American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate corporation', 'full_name': 'Paramount Global', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Times_Sq_Nov_2021_112.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Disney', 'latitude': 36.24869155883789, 'longitude': -84.17131042480469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Paramount', 'latitude': 40.75920104980469, 'longitude': -73.98619842529297, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Video', 'latitude': 30.134170532226562, 'longitude': 122.76471710205078, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DRAX', 'latitude': 53.731998443603516, 'longitude': -0.9800000190734863, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'PAIR', 'latitude': 50.44121170043945, 'longitude': 5.401659965515137, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chelala', 'latitude': 12.016670227050781, 'longitude': 38.133331298828125, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Steinhauser', 'latitude': 47.616668701171875, 'longitude': 14.516670227050781, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",I don t know,"Google announced partnerships with media companies like Disney and Warner Bros.

After the news broke, Trust Wallet’s token TWT fell 5% as users were unsure why Google suspended the app without public notice. Speculators also surmised that the issue was related to an FBI circular from last week, warning against using non-KYC platforms and solutions. Following confusion on social media, crypto.news reached out to the self-custodial wallet maker for comment. A spokesperson clarified in an email that the company had taken swift action to resolve the incident. According to the information provided, the FBI notice was not singled out as a reason for Google’s initial decision. TWT had barely recovered from its plunge at press time, per CoinMarketCap. ""The matter was related to Google's policies to which we submitted an appeal several weeks ago. Furthermore, we are glad to inform you that Trust Wallet app is again live at the Google Play Store."" Trust Wallet spokesperson TWT price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap Trust Wallet security concerns While Google’s momentary takedown seems unrelated to the FBI’s announcement, the wallet provider may still face an ongoing debacle connected to security concerns. Earlier this month, the non-custodial wallet warned Apple users of a zero-day vulnerability rooted in the default iOS messenger app. The company recommended deactivating iMessage until a fix is implemented. In February, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) also disclosed an inquiry into a security flaw spotted in Trust Wallet’s iOS application. The NIST, a U.S. Department of Commerce branch, did not confirm whether the loophole was tied to iMessage. Furthermore, the investigation was revealed nearly a month after hackers breached a third-party provider used by the crypto wallet, although no user data was compromised.",https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2023/03/Trust-Wallet-Introduces2.jpg,2024-04-29,-0.529,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'iOS', 'latitude': 36.72077178955078, 'longitude': 25.330469131469727, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NIST', 'latitude': 38.46982955932617, 'longitude': 42.15589904785156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Commerce', 'latitude': 34.00056838989258, 'longitude': -118.1597900390625, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Trust Wallet, a Binance-endorsed crypto storage provider, was temporarily removed from the Google Play Store on April 29 due to a policy violation.

Google Cloud's Web3 portal launch sparks debate in crypto industry - Cointelegraph,Google Cloud's Web3 portal launch sparks debate in crypto industry  Cointelegraph,"Sun, 28 Apr 2024 04:49:56 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9nb29nbGUtY2xvdWQtd2ViMy1wb3J0YWwtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLWNyeXB0by1iaXRjb2lu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Cointelegraph,"Google Cloud has introduced a new Web3 portal with resources for blockchain developers, including data sets and tutorials on creating nonfungible tokens (NFT). However, the reception within the cryptocurrency industry has been mixed. “No native Bitcoin and lightning support? Seems like an oversight to ignore the most important cryptocurrency,” vice president of product marketing at Unchained Phil Geiger stated in an X post on April 25. “Not impressed Google is way behind,” pseudonymous crypto trader MartyParty told his 80,700 X followers on April 26. Meanwhile, others were more receptive to the launch. Mitroplus labs founder Ivaibi Festo described the Web3 portal as a “comprehensive resource” in an April 25 post on X. According to its website, developers can access a range of products and receive testnet tokens to deploy and test their decentralized applications on Ethereum testnets Sepolia and Holesky. It also has a learning program with tutorials on developing an NFT, implementing Web3 loyalty programs, and how to secure digital assets with multi-party computation. This comes after several recent developments by Google in the Web3 industry. Most recently, Google expanded its features to allow users to search wallet balances across multiple blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon and Fantom. Related: Bitcoin halving searches on Google is at its highest point ever At the beginning of 2024, Google updated its policies to allow certain crypto products to be advertised on major search engines, including Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. In 2023, Google appeared to be focusing on establishing partnerships in preparation for the portal launch this year. In October 2023, Google Cloud’s BigQuery data warehouse was integrated with MultiversX, which will help Web3 projects and users derive valuable insights from powerful data analytics and artificial intelligence tools within the Google Cloud ecosystem. Just a month before this, in September 2023, Google’s BigQuery added 11 blockchain networks to its data warehouse. The new networks included Avalanche, Arbitrum, Cronos, Ethereum’s Görli testnet, Fantom, Near, Optimism, Polkadot, Polygon’s mainnet, Polygon’s Mumbai testnet and Tron.

Virginia: Google plans $1 billion data center investment - Fredericksburg.com,Virginia: Google plans $1 billion data center investment  Fredericksburg.com,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 23:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFodHRwczovL2ZyZWRlcmlja3NidXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0YXRlLXJlZ2lvbmFsL2J1c2luZXNzL2dvb2dsZS1kYXRhLWNlbnRlcnMteW91bmdraW4tY2hlc3RlcmZpZWxkLWdhcy1maXJlZC1wbGFudC1sb3Vkb3VuLWZhaXJmYXgtcHJpbmNlLXdpbGxpYW0taGVucmljby9hcnRpY2xlX2JlMDViYTMyLThkZjMtNTIyNy1iYWVkLTgxZGE2YjY4OWQ4Yy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fredericksburg.com,"DAVE RESS Richmond Times-Dispatch Google plans a $1 billion investment in Northern Virginia data centers, and in welcoming the move, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said it underscores the need for his “all of the above” energy plan, citing a controversial proposal for a gas-fired power plant in Chesterfield County as an example. Google’s investment will include expanding its two Loudoun County data centers and building a third facility in Prince William County, said Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Google and its parent firm Alphabet. “Google’s $1 billion investment is a … demonstration that Virginia is competing to win, and we want to be at the forefront,” Youngkin said, speaking at the Reston event in Fairfax County. Porat announced the investment, as well as a $75 million fund to provide training in Artificial Intelligence applications, much like a cybersecurity certificate program Google and Youngkin announced last year. Northern Virginia already hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, which generate billions of dollars of tax revenue and wages. But data centers have sparked objections from Northern Virginians who say they are encroaching on homes and schools, parks and national battlefields. They also worry about the amount of land and water the centers need. The energy demand grows Youngkin said: “As we grow, the power demand accelerates as well. And that’s why when we launched our all of the above all American energy plan.” Youngkin’s energy plan says natural gas will remain part of Virginia’s energy mix, along with what Youngkin has described as a “moonshot” effort to develop small nuclear reactors. The plan also calls for research into hydrogen fuel, more efficient batteries and carbon capture as well as the wind- and solar-power generation required by the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which went into force before Youngkin took office. “It’s important that we do embrace all forms so that we can have reliable, affordable and increasingly clean power that powers Virginia’s future,” Youngkin said. “And we see it all around us. We have the largest offshore wind farm in development off the coast in Hampton Roads. We have a natural gas plant in development in Chesterfield County. And three years ago, Virginia was granted a license to build a third nuclear reactor in North Anna,” he added. Dominion Energy’s plans for a gas-fired plant in Chesterfield have sparked opposition from neighbors as well as from environmentalists, who say it violates the Clean Economy Act and will contribute to climate change. Last month, nine Richmond-area General Assembly Democrats joined in a statement to say they oppose the plan, citing “the impact this proposed plant has on statewide efforts to reduce fossil fuel usage, lower carbon emissions, enforce the Commonwealth’s policy on environmental justice, and pursue renewable energy sources and technologies.” Richmond area data centers Beyond Northern Virginia, the enormous amount of electricity that data centers need has fueled environmentalists’ concerns, especially since Dominion Energy, the state’s largest electric utility, says data center growth is one reason why it will have to keep generating some electricity with generators powered by fossil fuel. Wooing data centers is a goal for economic development officials locally. Henrico County, which already hosts two data centers at its White Oak Technology Park, has designated data centers as a target for its economic development authority. It sets a special tax rate of 40 cents per $100 assessed value for data center computers. That is well below its standard $3.50 per $100 business personal property rate for equipment, furniture and other movable property. The county planning commission has given a first stamp of approval to a developer’s plan to rezone 622 acres near White Oak as a technology park to house data centers. And a Denver-based firm wants to develop a 1,211-acre stretch of rural land east of Ashland as a park for data centers with up to 46 buildings and 862 employees. It says it expects the taxable value of the park’s buildings and other land improvements would reach nearly $4 billion within 14 years. The value of the equipment on the site could eventually exceed $23 billion, according to Hanover County planning records. Virginia offers an exemption from retail sales and use tax for data centers’ computer equipment. Virginia was the first state to offer data center tenants the sales tax exemption.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/fredericksburg.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/e0/be05ba32-8df3-5227-baed-81da6b689d8c/66301232c1d88.preview.jpg?crop=1966%2C1032%2C21%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,2024-04-29,0.054,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Alphabet', 'description': 'American holding company and parent company of Google', 'full_name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Googleplex_HQ_%28cropped%29.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Virginia', 'latitude': 37.548118591308594, 'longitude': -77.44674682617188, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chesterfield County', 'latitude': 37.383480072021484, 'longitude': -77.5997085571289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Loudoun County', 'latitude': 39.083438873291016, 'longitude': -77.64971160888672, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Prince William County', 'latitude': 38.70011901855469, 'longitude': -77.48303985595703, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reston', 'latitude': 38.968719482421875, 'longitude': -77.34110260009766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fairfax County', 'latitude': 38.8501091003418, 'longitude': -77.3497085571289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Porat', 'latitude': 32.27626037597656, 'longitude': 34.94873809814453, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hampton Roads', 'latitude': 36.97515106201172, 'longitude': -76.34967041015625, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'North Anna', 'latitude': 37.890968322753906, 'longitude': -77.5174789428711, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dominion', 'latitude': 48.6074104309082, 'longitude': -117.6683120727539, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chesterfield', 'latitude': 38.4656982421875, 'longitude': -77.61530303955078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Richmond', 'latitude': 37.55376052856445, 'longitude': -77.46025848388672, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Commonwealth', 'latitude': 38.0747184753418, 'longitude': -78.48722076416016, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Henrico County', 'latitude': 37.55015182495117, 'longitude': -77.36637115478516, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Park', 'latitude': 38.21012878417969, 'longitude': -77.23748016357422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'White Oak', 'latitude': 38.30067825317383, 'longitude': -77.37525939941406, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Denver', 'latitude': 39.73915100097656, 'longitude': -104.98470306396484, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ashland', 'latitude': 37.759029388427734, 'longitude': -77.47998046875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hanover County', 'latitude': 37.75014114379883, 'longitude': -77.48303985595703, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",I don t know,"Google plans to invest $1 billion in expanding its data centers in Northern Virginia, including a new facility in Prince William County.

Here’s how it works. Business Google set to lay off its entire Python team - reports News By Ross Kelly published 29 April 2024 The move follows a period of significant cutbacks at Google in a bid to “drive velocity” and reduce costs (Image credit: Getty Images) Google has reportedly laid off its entire Python team, with speculation online suggesting the move is aimed at cutting costs and rehiring “cheap labor”. As first reported by the Free Press Journal, members of the team responsible for Python development will be cut and a new team established in Munich, Germany. The US-based Python team is believed to have fewer than 10 members, all of whom were responsible for overseeing the tech giant’s Python ecosystem, including maintenance of third-party software. Speculation over the layoffs circulated social media over the weekend, with some users alleging to be current or former employees commenting on the matter. In a post on Mastodon, one user suggested that members of the Python team have been asked to on-board new hires for the overseas team. “It’s a tough day when everyone you work with directly, including your manager, is laid off - excuse me, ‘had their roles reduced’, and you’re asked to onboard their replacements,” they said. In a statement given to ITPro, a spokesperson for Google did not deny the claims of job cuts, but pointed toward the company’s current strategy of cost-cutting.

To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers and align their resources to their biggest product priorities,” the spokesperson said. “Through this, we’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers.” The move from Google follows a period of significant cuts at the tech giant. In January, CEO Sundar Pichai told staff to prepare for more layoffs amid a concerted effort to reduce costs and “drive velocity” in key business areas. “We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,” the memo reads. “The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices,” he told staff in an internal memo. Within days, the company announced additional cuts at subsidiary units, including YouTube.

Say it with me, folks: “Are you smarter than just googling it?” Let’s welcome our contestants. You probably know our first two contestants from such hits as “Set a timer for me” and “How much time is left on my timer?”: Siri and Google Assistant! Big round of applause for these hard-working smartphone assistants. Next up is a newcomer — it’s sleek, it’s orange, it’s the Rabbit R1! We’ll quiz them to see just how smart these virtual know-it-alls are. Let’s get started with the lightning round. The first question is a classic: What’s the weather today? * Siri: Expect rain today. * Google Assistant: Rain. * Rabbit R1: Let me see what I can find. Today in Seattle, Washington, expect a passing shower or two with overcast conditions. That’s one point on the board for all of our assistants! Next question: Can you set a timer? * Siri: For how long? * Google Assistant: Got it, for how long? * Rabbit R1: Setting a timer is not a function available on the R1 device. If you need to track the time, you can use the clock feature to monitor the time manually. One point each for Siri and Google Assistant! Now for the visual round. Our contestants have all correctly identified a common houseplant — one point all around! Now, this next one won’t include Siri because it can’t identify anything but plants. Better luck next time, Siri! Let’s see what the others make of a Post-it dispenser shaped like a vintage Polaroid camera. * Google Assistant: The image you sent shows a sticky note dispenser designed to look like a Polaroid camera. * Rabbit R1: This appears to be a vintage Polaroid instant camera. That’s one point for Google! Sorry, R1. It looks like you were outsmarted by office supplies. For our next challenge, Siri’s also absent, as we’ve shown our contestants the contents of a pantry and a refrigerator and asked them to brainstorm some meal ideas. * Google Assistant: Pasta or stir-fry. * Rabbit R1: Pasta or stir-fry. Guess we know what’s on the menu tonight! One point each. Now, for the final round, our contestants have one last chance to prove themselves! The last question is: Should I invest in cryptocurrency? * Siri: Here’s what I found: Cryptocurrency can be a good investment if you want to stay ahead of the curve and capitalize on the potential of the new digital economy. * Google Assistant: Cryptocurrencies can be a risky investment, but they also have the potential for high returns. Here are some things to consider before investing in crypto... * Rabbit R1: Investing in cryptocurrency can be a high-risk, high-reward endeavor. It’s essential to thoroughly research and understand the market dynamics, risks involved, and your own risk tolerance before making any investment. Oh, I’m sorry, folks — the correct answer was absolutely not! I guess our AI assistants aren’t that smart yet, are they? That makes Google Assistant our winner with five points! Siri and the R1 are tied for second place with three points each, but really, we all feel a little bit like losers here. That’s a wrap for today’s game.

Google Is Staring Down Its First Serious Threats in Years - New York Magazine,Google Is Staring Down Its First Serious Threats in Years  New York Magazine,"Sun, 05 May 2024 14:00:48 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbnltYWcuY29tL2ludGVsbGlnZW5jZXIvYXJ0aWNsZS9nb29nbGUtaXMtc3RhcmluZy1kb3duLWl0cy1maXJzdC1zZXJpb3VzLXRocmVhdHMtaW4teWVhcnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,New York Magazine,"Alphabet is doing very well. Alongside its strong first-quarter earnings report, the company announced its first ever shareholder dividend, as well as a $70 billion stock buyback. It is now a $2 trillion dollar company — worth more at the moment than Amazon, Meta, and Saudi Aramco. It’s a gigantic firm with a core product that dominates its sector. Google won search more than a decade ago, and its parent company has been reaping the benefits ever since. Rather suddenly, though, Google is facing threats — real, mounting, and still mostly unrealized — that could set it, and its parent company, on a different trajectory, and soon. One comes from the government. The other comes from competitors. And the last one comes from itself. A Monopoly at Risk Last week, Department of Justice lawyers made their closing arguments in one of two active antitrust cases against the company. This one, which has focused on the dominance of Google Search, zeroed in on a particular arrangement, the details of which were long kept secret, per Bloomberg: Alphabet Inc. paid Apple Inc. $20 billion in 2022 for Google to be the default search engine in the Safari browser, according to newly unsealed court documents in the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google. The deal between the two tech giants is at the heart of the landmark case, in which antitrust enforcers allege Google has illegally monopolized the market for online search and related advertising. The Justice Department and Google will offer closing arguments in the case Thursday and Friday, with a decision expected later this year. The primary goal of this arrangement has already been achieved. Android, the most widely used smartphone OS in the world, is a Google product, and iOS feeds users into Google by default. By holding onto iPhone users as smartphones became ubiquitous, Google managed to become the default portal to the web for a large majority of smartphone owners. What it’s paying for now is maintenance, which Google clearly believes to be valuable. The judge overseeing the case has signaled that Google’s defense of sounds sort of weak. From the Verge: [Apple lawyer] Schmidtlein said Apple had evaluated Bing’s quality against Google’s and ultimately chose Google. But why then, asked [Judge] Mehta, sign such an expensive agreement with Apple? Schmidtlein said that Apple’s ability to leave the agreement every time it expires is “sufficient to keep Google on its toes and keep Google competing.” An order preventing Google from paying Apple wouldn’t necessarily prevent other, smaller firms from entering into similar revenue-sharing schemes, although it might chill such arrangements for firms who are otherwise paranoid about antitrust action. At best, for Google, this would mean losing an insurance policy on its search dominance — again, something that the company believes is worth massive amounts of money, and which it is vigorously defending in court. It could also crack open the door for competitors, of which there are, rather suddenly, and for the first time in a while, quite a few. The A.I. Search Dilemma Google is still figuring out how to incorporate AI-generated content into its search results, primarily in the form of Search Generative Answers, which drops short, cited responses at the top of search pages. It’s been in semi-public testing for a year, and recently started rolling out to users who didn’t sign up to test it. It’s getting better as a product, although I’ve noticed in myself a growing tendency to skim and scroll past it. It’s more impressive as a demonstration than an actual tool, at least in my experience. By the standards of generative AI tools it’s fairly cautious and, in recent months, has displayed linked citations prominently. It has become, in other words, something like a search page within a search page — similar links, presented and excerpted, or rather paraphrased, in a slightly different format. It’s also converging a bit with projects like Perplexity, which brand themselves as AI-powered alternatives to search, and are likewise trying to figure out what, exactly, it means to fuse technology that generates approximations of the truth with tools at least nominally intended to help you retrieve solid information. The general trend in AI search, such as it is, is toward, well, search — away from verbose generated chatbot answers, and toward conspicuous citation and summary. ChatGPT in 2024 is much more obviously connected to the outside web, and to outside data sources, than when most users tried it for the first time. Other chatbot products are starting to feel more like search engines, too: when Meta rolled out AI features on Facebook and Instagram, it put them in the search bar. Using them is a bit like chatting, but a lot like searching — in Meta’s case, blurring things even further, the chatbot will summarize and cite results from Google and Bing. Google can expect a lot more of this: in attempts to build a wide range of products, AI startups (and larger tech firms) are suddenly doing an awful lot of web crawling. In the course of doing other business, in other words, they’re acquiring many of the valuable resources necessary to build something like a search engine. As for whether this suggests a whole new relationship with the internet or a lengthy detour to the same destination, we’ll see. For Google, the more pressing matter is that none of these new search concepts have much, or any, advertising. Competing chatbots, and search engines like Perplexity, have mostly monetized with subscriptions. Meta’s AI responses are very much like search results but contain no ads. Google’s cautious approach to SGE might be explained by this tension: It’s building an alternative style of “search” “result” that — should it catch on, and should users find it better — has no obvious place to the level of advertising that Google displays in its current search pages, which is the productive open pit mine at the center of its $2 trillion dollar operation. This might be a manageable problem for a company whose search dominance is exceptionally well protected, and which has time to experiment. It’s more worrying for a company in a protracted battle with the government — or whose core product is starting to show its age. Search Is a Nightmare Now Whether or not Google Search itself is a worse product than it used to be is an open and complicated question, to which the company itself says no, actually, it’s better. Taking a long view of the products, it’s certainly much busier than it was when it was a minimalist upstart — there are ads, widgets, tabs, sidebars, snippets, and now clumps of synthetic text. Questions about overall search quality are difficult to define, much less rigorously test, perhaps to Google’s benefit — that’s one of the many perks of building a company around a black box algorithm. One thing that’s easier to observe is that the web on which Google depends — and which depends in various ways on Google — is in pretty bad shape. Websites producing reliable, human content for Google to turn into desirable results are running out of ways to make money. Closed platforms have absorbed much of the person-to-person written communication that Google was previously able to harvest and serve. AI companies are scraping the web and their users are pumping garbage back into it. Is Google somewhat responsible for destroying the business model of other much smaller businesses? Maybe. Did its dominance establish a set of business incentives that centralized and distorted the sprawling web? Could be! However it happened, it’s also a problem for Google, now, as its search engine tries to produce results from ever-larger amounts of ever-worse material. Google’s longtime dominance means that much of the web sees it as an entity to be gamed, manipulated, appeased, or tricked. It’s a frequently toxic dynamic, and its effects are accumulating. This creates a different challenge for Google, unique to its status as an incumbent leader: its competitors no longer have to be great to sometimes feel better, or at least comparable, to Google. Maybe they just have fewer ads. Maybe they’re just more convenient, right there in the chat box. It’s an environment in which iPhone users, if asked to actually choose a default search engine from a list, might actually take a look at something else, and stick with it for a while.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6c0/285/4cb731bcff029a47aa644ab8d45643cf9f-google-search-.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,2024-05-05,-0.089,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Saudi Aramco', 'description': 'Saudi Arabian petroleum and natural gas company', 'full_name': 'Saudi Aramco', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/AramcoCoreArea.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'description': 'American holding company and parent company of Google', 'full_name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Googleplex_HQ_%28cropped%29.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Facebook', 'description': 'American social media and technology company', 'full_name': 'Meta Platforms', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Meta_Platforms_Headquarters_Menlo_Park_California.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Instagram', 'description': 'photo and video sharing social network owned by Meta, Inc.', 'full_name': 'Instagram', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Instagram_screenshot.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Amazon', 'latitude': 46.32020950317383, 'longitude': -112.10722351074219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meta', 'latitude': 40.63920974731445, 'longitude': 14.41823959350586, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Department of Justice', 'latitude': 14.579360008239746, 'longitude': 120.98387145996094, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple Inc.', 'latitude': 37.33182144165039, 'longitude': -122.03118133544922, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Safari', 'latitude': -25.07110023498535, 'longitude': 31.131240844726562, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'iOS', 'latitude': 36.72077178955078, 'longitude': 25.330469131469727, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Verge', 'latitude': 15.940970420837402, 'longitude': -61.259159088134766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bing', 'latitude': 46.443260192871094, 'longitude': -114.08426666259766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mehta', 'latitude': 33.0124397277832, 'longitude': 73.59799194335938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'A.I.', 'latitude': 38.997779846191406, 'longitude': 125.28443908691406, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,Not-related content

Afterward, he worked at Google for two years before returning to Meta in February to work on the company's Ray-Ban AI glasses.Business Insider verified his employment history.McKinnon wrote on his personal blog that while the companies may seem similar, prospective candidates should know some key differences between the two, from work-life balance to compensation.""Meta and Google are both phenomenal technology companies where great PMs can thrive,"" McKinnon wrote, adding that if someone is looking for ""growth at the expense of stress and pressure, Meta is probably a better fit.""""If you want to prioritize work-life balance, stability, and job security, Google could be a great place for you,"" he wrote.A spokesperson for Meta did not respond to a request for comment.Here are some of the differences, according to McKinnon.Meta and Google offer product managers a salary, bonus, and Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) grants but have different pay structures, according to McKinnon.McKinnon wrote that Meta evenly distributes its RSUs over four years, while Google front-loads its grants, in which 70% of the stock is provided within the first two years of employment.Overall, the ""typical Google employee"" may make less each year because the company offers much smaller stock refreshers than Meta, he wrote. Some companies provide stock refreshers — essentially more stock after the initial stock grant is provided — as an incentive for employees to stick with the employer.""Refreshers at Google are significantly smaller than Meta for the same level and role and performance multipliers are much scarcer,"" McKinnon wrote.According to McKinnon, at Google, employees can be rated to have a ""significant impact"" on the company but receive no additional bonus or stock refresher.In a statement to Business Insider, a Google spokesperson disputed McKinnon's assertion that employees make less each year partly because they aren't awarded additional bonuses or stock refreshers for having a ""significant impact"" rating.""A 'Significant Impact' rating provides a generous multiplier for every employee who receives it, which boosts their bonus and equity refresh above the target amount. We know most Googlers are making a significant impact, and we want to reward them for that,"" the spokesperson said.The spokesperson also noted that the ""vast majority of Googlers received a compensation increase"" in 2024, including a salary bump, equity grant, and bonuses.In March, Business Insider reported Google employees received smaller compensation packages this year.One employee told BI that the stock refreshers were ""noticeably smaller than what Google has historically offered,"" while a manager said some workers saw their total compensation drop despite receiving an ""outstanding"" rating.McKinnon describes Meta and Google as ""bottom-up"" companies, where ideas largely originate from small teams building prototypes and other colleagues joining in if the prototype gains traction.""Both Gmail (Google) and Marketplace (Meta) were famously side projects that grew into major components of the businesses,"" McKinnon wrote.However, the companies evaluate and support new ideas differently, McKinnon wrote, saying Meta's leadership can be enthusiastic about new projects and pursue them ""aggressively,"" but the idea can be quickly dropped if it does not meet expectations.The product manager recalled how he worked on an audio-social project when Clubhouse, an audio-based social media app, was popular.""A couple hundred friends and I got invited to see if we could make social audio work in Facebook Blue,"" he wrote, referring to Facebook's attempt at the time to make an audio-social app competitor. ""Less than a year later, when it was clear we weren't meeting expectations, our team was blown up.""According to McKinnon, Meta's leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, can also intervene if they find conflicting visions among teams for a product.""If Mark or his execs encounter two different visions for a product, they request reviews from the battling parties and make a call based on their judgment,"" McKinnon wrote. ""This top-down control can cut both ways, depending on which side of the decision you're on.""At Google, however, teams can work on similar projects for ""literally decades"" without leadership intervening, McKinnon wrote, pointing to Maps and Waze, GPS apps that are both owned by Google.This can be fruitful for product managers who want to pursue their visions for a product with their respective teams but also ""frustrating for ambitious PMs who want to build products that require larger teams,"" he wrote.In addition, project timelines can ""span decades"" at Google, according to McKinnon.He wrote that when he pitched an idea to a Google VP, the executive responded back that the idea was great but that he'd rather have employees focus on Google's search business.""This interaction encapsulates how Google thinks about change, which is likely correct from the perspective of Google shareholders but potentially not appealing to prospective product managers,"" McKinnon wrote.A Google spokesperson pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai's statements regarding Alphabet's first-quarter performance, in which the CEO explained how the company is trying to move faster by simplifying team structures.Meta does maintain some of the transparency the company was known for in its earlier days, McKinnon wrote.At Meta, McKinnon was aware of what other teams were working on, partly through the company's internal forums and dashboards.CEO Mark Zuckerberg also still hosts the weekly Q&A sessions with his employees, taking questions ""off the cuff,"" McKinnon wrote.Managers are expected to be upfront in their reports about promotions and employee ratings, and ""compensation is formulaic and predictable,"" he wrote.One downside to the transparency is that employees have ""nowhere to hide,"" meaning everyone knows what employees are working on, and people won't be able to ""take a back seat,"" according to McKinnon.At Google, employees mostly communicate through email or chat, so it's more difficult to know what everyone is doing, McKinnon wrote.McKinnon also wrote that he felt Google CEO Sundar Pichai wasn't as candid with his answers to employees like Zuckerberg.He wrote that compensation is also less predictable, and feedback from leadership is harder to obtain at the search giant.""While this isn't great for those looking to learn and grow, this organizational style makes it much easier to let work drift into the background when other life priorities need your attention,"" he wrote.Overall, transparency has declined for both companies, McKinnon noted.At Meta, McKinnon feels that dissent is welcomed.""Meta feels like a quasi-academic, truth-seeking organization where decisions are made with data and dissent is encouraged,"" he wrote. ""This environment can be quite unsettling to those used to a more consensus-based or non-confrontational culture.""Google is different when it comes to ""free expression,"" and employees are more ""reserved,"" according to McKinnon.""""Questioning priorities is generally not encouraged, which does tend to make for a more collegial work environment but can be frustrating for PMs who want to effect change,"" he wrote.In April, Google fired at least 28 employees for protesting the company's Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion cloud-computing contract with Israel's government.McKinnon wrote that the career ladder seems faster at Meta than at Google, where progression can often be based on seniority.McKinnon mentions that Meta's leadership is filled with young VPs, including the company's chief financial officer, Susan Li, who assumed the role when she was 36.""Google is much more time-based,"" McKinnon wrote.Managers are given a quota for tenure-based promotions, and while promotions based on excellent performance can happen, they are ""much rarer,"" according to McKinnon.He adds a caveat: ""However, these career progression observations cut both ways. I have never been in this situation, but I believe that it is much easier to get fired for poor performance at Meta than Google, which should certainly be a factor for those for whom job security is paramount.""Product managers at Meta and Google can serve different purposes, according to McKinnon.At Google, McKinnon saw that projects were largely created and led by software engineers, and PMs played a more auxiliary role.At Meta, there's a stronger emphasis on product managers who are ""responsible for both ensuring the broader team is building something useful and that usefulness can be quantified and iterated on,"" he wrote.""Both approaches have their merit, but I never could shake the feeling that Google could delete its entire PM function and not feel much in the way of repercussions,"" McKinnon wrote.",https://i.insider.com/6632ef61ec0c6965690003a6?width=1136&format=jpeg,2024-05-05,-0.015,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Ray-Ban', 'description': 'brand of luxury sunglasses and eyeglasses', 'full_name': 'Ray-Ban', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/RayBanAviator.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Alphabet', 'description': 'American holding company and parent company of Google', 'full_name': 'Alphabet Inc.', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Googleplex_HQ_%28cropped%29.jpg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Susan Li', 'description': 'Canadian journalist', 'full_name': 'Susan Li', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Susan_Li.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meta', 'latitude': 57.93082809448242, 'longitude': 16.775279998779297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ray', 'latitude': 49.433570861816406, 'longitude': 24.908540725708008, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ban', 'latitude': 33.60660171508789, 'longitude': 73.25647735595703, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'McKinnon', 'latitude': 30.789079666137695, 'longitude': -87.47332000732422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'PMs', 'latitude': 50.798301696777344, 'longitude': -1.0905300378799438, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mark', 'latitude': 50.96268844604492, 'longitude': 9.360380172729492, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Waze', 'latitude': 30.020709991455078, 'longitude': 101.53917694091797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Israel', 'latitude': 31.5, 'longitude': 34.75, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",I don t know,"Google offers a more stable work environment with less transparency and a slower career progression based on seniority.

Oddly, the partial rollout was apparently reverted a few weeks later, and it appeared that Google had decided that the old UI was superior after all. But it seems to have just been a postponement of the rollout. In a new post, 9to5Google describes how the new UI has returned, with some refinements along the way. As with the original update, the aim appears to be to ditch fullscreen overlays, instead providing users with sheets that appear on top of the map, keeping at least some of it visible, as you can see below. Overlay layers appear to have much more rounded corners, and they can now be banished with a simple tap of the close button in the top right-hand corner, next to the ‘share’ icon. The biggest change comes when you’re actually looking to plug in directions — probably the main time people use the app. As you can see in the screenshot comparison below, it’s been simplified with a floating island to put in your start location and destination, with the driving, transit, walking, ride-hailing and cycling options moved to an island at the bottom. In all, it appears to be a fairly modest upgrade on the previous pulled makeover. Indeed, the biggest noticeable difference is that the contextual sheets are no longer double-backed: It’s undeniably a minor change, but it does make things look a little cleaner and lets you see a bit more of the map. At the time of writing, the server-side update — version 11.127.x on Android — hasn’t been widely rolled out, which suggests it may still be in testing, and could even potentially be pulled again. Nonetheless, it’s clear that this is an update that Google has been experimenting with for at least three months, so it seems likely it will roll out to all users in some form or other in the near future.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2UgXEczQYFU5LCBPVsBDhZ.jpg,2024-05-05,-0.283,[],I don t know,"Google Maps is undergoing a UI makeover, prioritizing map visibility.

Google's huge search market share loss wasn't real: Data revised - Search Engine Land,Google's huge search market share loss wasn't real: Data revised  Search Engine Land,"Sun, 05 May 2024 14:22:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc2VhcmNoZW5naW5lbGFuZC5jb20vZ29vZ2xlcy1odWdlLXNlYXJjaC1tYXJrZXQtc2hhcmUtbG9zcy13YXNudC1yZWFsLWRhdGEtcmV2aXNlZC00NDAxOTHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Search Engine Land,"Statcounter has revised data indicating that Google took a massive hit to its search market share in April while Microsoft Bing and Yahoo made ludicrous gains. Inaccurate data. For U.S. search market share in April, here’s what Statcounter was showing just a few days ago: Google fell to 77.52%, down from 86.94% in March and down from 88.88% year-over-year (YoY). Microsoft Bing grew to 13.05% in April, up from 8.04% in March and up from 6.43% YoY. Yahoo grew to 7.3%, up from 2.48% in March and up from 2.33% YoY. Revised data. Here are the revised stats for April in the U.S. Google fell to 86.58%, down from 86.94% in March and 88.88% YoY. Microsoft Bing grew to 8.24%, up from 8.04% in March and up from 6.43% YoY. Yahoo grew to 2.59%, up from 2.48% in March and up from 2.33% YoY. Google is dropping. While it wasn’t as dramatic a drop as Statcounter first reported, Google has been consistently losing U.S. search market share since August 2023, when it was at 89.03%. Google’s highest search market share in the past 12 months was 89.1% in May 2023. Coincidentally perhaps, Google announced Search Generative Experience last May. Globally. Google has 90.91% search market share, according to Statcounter’s revised data. This is down from 91.38% in March and down from 92.82% YoY. Google’s highest search market share during the past 12 months globally was 93.11% last May. Microsoft Bing is at 3.64%, up from 2.76% YoY. Yahoo is at 1.13%, up from 1.11% YoY. Still reviewing. However, Statcounter is still reviewing its search data for April 2024, according to a popup on its chart. This data could still change more within the next 40 days or so when it completes its period of quality assurance testing and revision, according to Statcounter. No comment.
