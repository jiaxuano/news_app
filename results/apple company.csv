The latest to join this unfortunate list is Tesla, the brainchild of Elon Musk. On Monday, it was reported that the company is contemplating a workforce reduction of over 10 per cent. As per reports, these Tesla layoffs are a result of role duplications within the company. The decision to implement these job cuts across the entire organisation could affect over 14,000 employees, as per a Reuters report citing an internal memo. In the last few months of 2024, the industry has experienced a surge in layoffs from major players across various sectors, leaving a significant number of employees without jobs. Here are some of the major layoffs that have occurred this year. McKinsey Layoffs: McKinsey has reportedly implemented layoffs affecting approximately 360 positions amidst a decrease in demand for its consulting services. According to the reports, the layoffs were set to be executed globally in April, affecting employees across various divisions such as design, data engineering, cloud, and software. Earlier in the month, the firm reportedly introduced an unconventional offer to specific employees, which states that they accept nine months' salary and opt for a sabbatical. Alongside career coaching assistance and supplementary resources, the management consulting firm extends this package to specific UK staff considering departure. Apple Layoffs: Apple, the tech giant, has reportedly terminated more than 600 employees in California this month. According to filings with the California Employment Development Department, these layoffs impacted individuals involved in projects concerning car and smartwatch displays as the company aims to wrap up these initiatives. The tech firm also fired hundreds of employees in February. Amazon Layoffs: Amazon announced several rounds of layoffs across different departments in the first four months of this year, including the Amazon Web Services (AWS) division, affecting thousands of employees worldwide. Also Read: McKinsey Layoffs: Consulting Firm To Fire 360 Employees Barclays Layoffs: Barclays decided to downsize its investment banking division workforce by several hundred employees in March, which will result in the laying off employees in the coming months. This move aligns with the bank's long-term goal of optimising expenses and boosting profitability within the unit. Google Layoffs: Throughout these four months of 2024, the tech major Google has announced several rounds of layoffs affecting hundreds of its employees across multiple divisions, showing that it will take some time before the tech sector’s situation comes back to normal. Unilever Layoffs: Unilever, the parent company of popular ice cream brands like Magnum and Ben & Jerry's, has announced intentions to separate its ice cream division into an independent entity. This strategic decision coincides with the introduction of a new cost-saving plan that impacted around 7,500 positions worldwide within the company.

As of February 2, 2024, the company reported an employee count of nearly 120,000, down from approximately 126,000 the previous year, indicating a reduction of about 6,000 jobs. IBM Layoffs: The tech firm reportedly fired several people from the marketing and communications teams.

The delay in the arrival of the iPhone 14 Plus With official selling price in Brazil from R$ 8.599, Apple Lossless Audio CODEC (ALAC), announced that the “third brother” of the family iPhone 14 arrives in Brazil only “soon”, but it is already possible to place the order in the online store. It won't ship on October 14 like the other variants, but as soon as it's available, the company will announce the arrival date. And this delay has an explanation: according to the analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, product specialist Apple Lossless Audio CODEC (ALAC),, the company has been facing problems in pre-sales abroad. He also mentioned on his blog that the variant is more expensive to produce compared to the other members of the iPhone 14 line and still loses in cost-effectiveness for the 2022 and 2021 models. The iPhone 14 Plus is a replacement for the iPhone 13 mini. However, pre-sales results for this new product were significantly lower than expected. Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple product specialist. The company preferred to put other models, which are more successful, on sale in foreign countries so that orders are smaller and it is possible to save money at the time of production. Remembering that during the final week of September 2022, Brazilians who purchased the devices abroad and tried to use them in Brazil faced problems in activating the eSIM, then we can only hope that this problem has been resolved for the launch of the models in our country.

Apple CEO says company will 'look at' manufacturing in Indonesia - ABC News,Apple CEO says company will 'look at' manufacturing in Indonesia  ABC News,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 05:16:20 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3Mvd2lyZVN0b3J5L2FwcGxlLWNlby1jb21wYW55LW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctaW5kb25lc2lhLTEwOTMzNzY2NtIBYWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vYW1wL0J1c2luZXNzL3dpcmVTdG9yeS9hcHBsZS1jZW8tY29tcGFueS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWluZG9uZXNpYS0xMDkzMzc2NjY?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,ABC News,"JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company will “look at” manufacturing in Indonesia as he met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday. “We talked about the president’s desire to see manufacturing in the country, and it’s something that we will look at,” Cook told reporters after the meeting. Widodo’s administration has worked for years to bring manufacturing to the country to power economic development, while Apple is seeking to diversify its supply chains away from China, where most of its smartphones and tablets are assembled. The company began moving some production to countries like Vietnam, and more recently India, after shutdowns to fight COVID-19 in China repeatedly disrupted the company’s shipments. “I think the investment ability in Indonesia is endless. I think that, there is a lot of great places to invest, and we’re investing. We believe in the country,” Cook said. The previous day, Cook met Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi, where he said Apple plans to invest more in Vietnam and increase spending on suppliers in the Southeast Asian manufacturing hub. “Given the slowing Chinese economy as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing efforts to squeeze out foreign companies and replace them with domestic brands, Apple wants alternatives for manufacturing,” said Chris Miller, an associate professor at Tufts University whose work focuses on technology and geopolitics. “It has already invested more in India and Vietnam, but it is likely looking at other partners in South East Asia to additional manufacturing and assembly operations,” Miller said. Cook's visit to Indonesia came after Apple announced its fourth Apple Developer Academy in the country, to be located in Bali. The company first launched the program to train app developers in Indonesia in 2018, in the capital Jakarta. Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia, but the company says it has invested 1.6 trillion rupiah ($99 million) in its app developer ecosystem in the country. Widodo's government has sought to leverage the country's reserves of nickel and other raw materials to bring in manufacturing, banning export of raw commodities such as nickel and bauxite to oblige companies to build refineries domestically. After the meeting with Widodo, Cook also met Indonesia’s president-elect Prabowo Subianto, who is currently defense minister, in Jakarta. He's set to take power in October. Indonesia’s minister of communication and information, Budi Arie Setiadi, said Wednesday that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella would visit Indonesia at the end of April. ___ Associated Press writers Victoria Milko in Jakarta and Zen Soo in Hong Kong contributed to this report.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/fa36af73-6749-41fe-b160-2679465ad78d/wirestory_64670d385fdde4643429b2e76fdb951f_16x9.jpg?w=1600,2024-04-17,0.025,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Chris Miller', 'description': 'American football player', 'full_name': 'Chris Miller', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Atlanta_Falcons_at_Los_Angeles_Rams_1991-12-08_-_01_%28Atlanta_Falcons_crop%29.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'JAKARTA', 'latitude': -6.214620113372803, 'longitude': 106.84513092041016, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Indonesia', 'latitude': -5.0, 'longitude': 120.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127498626708984, 'longitude': -95.4175033569336, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cook', 'latitude': 39.547218322753906, 'longitude': -97.61197662353516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Widodo', 'latitude': -7.323060035705566, 'longitude': 111.06139373779297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'China', 'latitude': 35.0, 'longitude': 105.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Vietnam', 'latitude': 16.166669845581055, 'longitude': 107.83332824707031, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'India', 'latitude': 20.0, 'longitude': 77.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hanoi', 'latitude': 21.024499893188477, 'longitude': 105.84117126464844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tufts University', 'latitude': 42.404541015625, 'longitude': -71.11978149414062, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'South East Asia', 'latitude': 11.005900382995605, 'longitude': 109.16000366210938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Miller', 'latitude': 36.41645812988281, 'longitude': -94.26437377929688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Academy', 'latitude': 37.6440315246582, 'longitude': -77.36637115478516, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bali', 'latitude': -8.5, 'longitude': 115.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Jakarta', 'latitude': -6.214620113372803, 'longitude': 106.84513092041016, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hong Kong', 'latitude': 22.285520553588867, 'longitude': 114.1576919555664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo to discuss manufacturing in Indonesia.

"Apple loses top phonemaker spot to Samsung as iPhone shipments drop, research company says - NBC News","Apple loses top phonemaker spot to Samsung as iPhone shipments drop, research company says  NBC News","Mon, 15 Apr 2024 14:29:09 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2FwcGxlLWxvc2VzLXRvcC1waG9uZW1ha2VyLXNwb3Qtc2Ftc3VuZy1pcGhvbmUtc2hpcG1lbnRzLWRyb3AtcmVzZWFyY2gtcmNuYTE0NzgyONIBK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL3JjbmExNDc4Mjg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,NBC News,"Apple’s smartphone shipments dropped about 10% in the first quarter of 2024, hurt by intensifying competition by Android smartphone makers aiming for the top spot, data from research firm IDC showed on Sunday. Global smartphone shipments increased 7.8% to 289.4 million units during January-March, with Samsung, at 20.8% market share, clinching the top phonemaker spot from Apple. The iPhone-maker’s steep sales decline comes after its strong performance in the December quarter when it overtook Samsung as the world’s No.1 phone maker. It’s back to the second spot, with 17.3% market share, as Chinese brands such as Huawei gain market share. Xiaomi, one of China’s top smartphone makers, occupied the third position with a market share of 14.1% during the first quarter. South Korea’s Samsung, which launched its latest flagship smartphone lineup — Galaxy S24 series — in the beginning of the year, shipped more than 60 million phones during the period. Global sales of Galaxy S24 smartphones jumped 8%, compared to last year’s Galaxy S23 series during their first three weeks of availability, data provider Counterpoint previously said. In the first quarter, Apple shipped 50.1 million iPhones, down from 55.4 million units it shipped same period last year, according to IDC. Apple’s smartphone shipments in China shrank 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023 from a year earlier. The drop underscores the challenges facing the U.S. firm in its third biggest market, as some Chinese companies and government agencies limit employees’ use of Apple devices, a measure that mirrors U.S. government restrictions on Chinese apps on security grounds.

Samsung Overtakes Apple as World's Top Smartphone Provider - Investopedia,Samsung Overtakes Apple as World's Top Smartphone Provider  Investopedia,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 13:46:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vc2Ftc3VuZy1vdmVydGFrZXMtYXBwbGUtYXMtd29ybGQtcy10b3Atc21hcnRwaG9uZS1wcm92aWRlci04NjMxMzg00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Investopedia,"Samsung Electronics has overtaken Apple (AAPL) as the world’s top smartphone provider in the first quarter, according to data from research firm International Data Corporation (IDC), while Chinese rivals like Xiaomi and Transsion grabbed market share. Global shipments of Apple iPhones fell 9.6% year-over-year to 50.1 million units in the first three months of the year, while Samsung’s fell 0.7% to 60.1 million units, IDC said. Apple’s market share globally fell to 17.3% from 20.7% a year ago, while Samsung’s fell to 20.8% from 22.5%. Chinese firms Xiaomi and Transsion, the third- and fourth-largest smartphone providers, respectively, added market share. Xiaomi had a 14.1% market share in the first quarter, up from 11.4% in 2023, while Transsion had a 9.9% market share, up from 5.7% a year ago. Oppo, another Chinese smartphone maker, was in fifth place at 8.7% market share, down from 10.3% last year. Still, the broader smartphone industry is seeing a revival, with global smartphone shipments rising 7.8% year-over-year during the quarter. Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC's Worldwide Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers, said that the research firm expects Apple and Samsung ""to maintain their hold on the high end of the market."" He said, however, that the rise of the Chinese firms means that both Samsung and Apple would have to look ""for areas to expand and diversify."" ""As the recovery progresses, we're likely to see the top companies gain share as the smaller brands struggle for positioning,"" Reith added. Nabila Popal, research director with IDC's Worldwide Tracker team, said the research firm also saw average selling prices of smartphones continue to rise during the quarter as ""consumers opt for more expensive devices knowing they will hold onto their devices longer."" The decline in market share marks a turnaround for Apple, which last year became the top smartphone seller in China, IDC said in January. Last year was a tough one for China's broader smartphone market, with overall shipments in the country dropping 5% from 2022 levels. Apple shares were down about 1% after the opening bell Monday.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/yIkytZ8tQ5-fTr0HLREKDjwxkNU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-2147729919-e8b98d28143a42798b23c85cac0af521.jpg,2024-04-15,-0.184,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Samsung', 'latitude': 36.39739990234375, 'longitude': 127.7323989868164, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Xiaomi', 'latitude': 26.883329391479492, 'longitude': 104.04167175292969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reith', 'latitude': 47.76390075683594, 'longitude': 11.776419639587402, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'China', 'latitude': 35.0, 'longitude': 105.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not directly related,"Apple's global smartphone market share fell to 17.3% in Q1 2023, down from 20.7% a year ago.

We have collected the best phones exactly 20 years ago and continue to talk about the world of mobile technology until the Apple iPhone. Progress was unstoppable, mobile devices were becoming more affordable and functional, and smartphones were no longer something unattainable, penetrating deeper into the masses. Sony Ericsson K300 This phone is undoubtedly the best budget phone of 2004. The Sony Ericsson K300 offered great features and excellent software for little money. The device was able to work with MP3/MP4 files, which could only be dreamed of by owners of similar Siemens. The built-in memory was also not spared – 12 MB for an inexpensive phone at the time was quite good. Competitors like Nokia and Samsung offered half the storage capacity for the money and couldn’t boast of as good Java support. With a built-in camera, fast gaming, an infrared port, compact size, excellent software, and the best multimedia support, the Sony Ericsson K300 is definitely worthy of attention, even though it was released at the turn of 2004 and 2005. You didn’t have to buy something premium to be completely happy, because the K300 gave you a «combine» feeling in your pocket. Sony Ericsson K700 The Sony Ericsson K700 was an affordable flagship killer with a built-in camera. It was this model that laid a solid foundation for the future hit and the best push-button phone ever – the SE K750i. The phone was one of the first to receive a high-quality LED flash and a large amount of built-in memory in its class. The 41 MB was enough for several hundred VGA camera photos and a lot of videos, and you could also install video games and programs without any restrictions. Platform Sony Ericsson A100 offered incredible features that were close to those of premium smartphones of the time. The K700 was distinguished from its analogs by smooth operation with 3D games and background applications. In addition to the functional software, Sony Ericsson K700 had a luxurious set of interfaces, namely Bluetooth 1.1, FM radio and an infrared port, which had almost no restrictions, unlike other manufacturers. Despite the lack of memory card support and a small 1.8-inch display, the Sony Ericsson K700 was one of the most successful phones of the first quarter of 2004. Sony Ericsson P910 Along with push-button phones, Sony Ericsson developed a series of Symbian-based smartphones. A successful continuation in the form of Sony Ericsson P910 once again showed a significant demand for devices of this class. The phone is maximally stuffed: a 156 MHz processor from Phillips, 64 MB of internal memory and support for memory cards up to 2 GB! In addition to a 2.9-inch display with a resolution of 208×320 pixels, Sony Ericsson P910 finally got a QWERTY keyboard, which was appreciated by business people who often corresponded by e-mail. There was also support for handwriting with a stylus. A built-in camera, a top-of-the-line memory subsystem, a full set of wireless interfaces, a large battery, support for MP4/MP3 multimedia formats, a functional HTML browser and a huge number of applications for Symbian 7.0 UIQ – all this led Sony Ericsson P910 to inevitable success. There were few direct competitors for this model, which had a positive impact on sales and allowed the company to grow in this direction, developing a series of communicators based on the Symbian touchscreen shell. In a year, the ultra-top P990 will be released, which will be the last successful solution in this line. The rotary phone form factor was supported for some time because of its image status. Only touchscreen models with a capacitive screen stopped this trend. The iPhone buried all types of multimedia phones, forcing the whole world to copy their concept of physical interaction without keys, bringing all manufacturers to their knees. Motorola RAZR V3 This phone showed that the majority of the population does not care about technical characteristics, and the main criterion when choosing is the appearance. The most popular phone in the United States in the early noughties, the Motorola RAZR V3 became a real hit and a fashion icon until the Apple iPhone appeared. The only technical strength of the Motorola RAZR V3 was the display, or rather two displays. A large diagonal and a fairly high-quality TFT matrix are good, of course, but fans of numbers in the specs table were not surprised by this. Apart from the VGA camera, 6 MB of internal memory and Bluetooth 1.2, there was nothing outstanding in the V3. The main trump card of the Motorola RAZR V3 was its incredible design with a metal body. The aggressive style and 14 mm thickness did the trick – the device was swept off store shelves, because no monoblock gave such a cool effect as opening the Motorola RAZR V3 with a sharp wave of the hand. It was after this clamshell that other companies, such as LG and Samsung, started promoting thin phones. Despite the presence of a lot of beautiful competitors, the Motorola RAZR V3 confidently holds the title of the best image phone of 2004 and for a long time afterwards it remained a desirable purchase. Motorola E398 The American company was aggressively attacking all market segments, so the emergence of a youth music phone with maximum functionality for a moderate price was inevitable. Motorola E398 is considered to be the TOP-1 music phone of 2004 and there are several good reasons for this. The device had the best stereo speakers on the market, a functional music player, MP3/MP4 and memory card support. In addition, it was one of the first phones with a micro SD slot. It was loved not only for its excellent musical potential, but also for its balance in all other aspects. The Motorola E398 boasted a VGA camera with flash, a fairly good 1.9-inch TFT screen, an HTML browser, and functional firmware that, although inferior to the Sony Ericsson A100 platform, offered more features than LG or Samsung software. Motorola MPx In the smartphone segment, Motorola also had its trump card in the form of a superflagship with the best features. The capabilities of the Motorola MPx impressed even the owners of the best Nokia smartphones. At the beginning of 2004, the functionality of this model was head and shoulders above the competition. It was one of the first phones with an infrared port, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi at the same time. Communication capabilities are backed by the Microsoft Pocket PC 2003 SE operating system, and a 200 MHz processor is responsible for performance. There is 16 MB of internal memory, and an MMC/SD slot is available for expansion. The Motorola MPx was distinguished from most typical PDAs of the time by its unique design and a top-of-the-line 1.3 MP camera with built-in flash. The form factor of the clamshell is no less interesting, and especially the method of its realization. It was the engineers of the American company who hinted to the Finnish ones to create the future flagships of the Nokia N Series. The phone opened vertically like a classic «frog» and horizontally like a laptop. The combined keyboard allowed working in both modes, and it was complemented by a 2.8-inch touchscreen display. The Motorola MPx can be confidently considered one of the best Windows smartphones of 2004, which literally replaced a laptop on the go. Nokia 6630 The incredible success of Nokia 6600 made engineers work hard to develop an updated version, which became Nokia 6630. In just a year, technology has leaped far and the new Symbian flagship received the latest OS 8.0, an updated interface, a twice as powerful processor and better multimedia capabilities. There is only 10 MB of built-in memory, but it can be easily expanded using RS-MMC cards. The 1.3 MP camera is a major improvement over the VGA camera of its predecessor, and the trans-reflective display remains unchanged. It makes no sense to describe the capabilities of the Nokia 6630 because it could do literally everything imaginable in 2004. Console-level games that Sony Ericsson owners could only dream of with their optimized Java machine, an open file system, and the simplest possible interface. The Nokia 6630 is not just a functional smartphone, but the most beginner-friendly computer in your pocket with the best gaming capabilities of the time Symbian 8.0 was much easier to learn than Windows Mobile, Palm OS, or Blackberry OS, so Nokia 6630 became extremely popular. Moreover, Symbian 8 is considered to be the benchmark and the peak of the company’s strength because with the transition to the new kernel, things went downhill for this wonderful OS, but more on that in the next issue for 2005. Nokia 6260 The Nokia 6260 laid the foundation stone for the future N series with a swivel display, as it featured a screen that could be rotated 180 degrees. The smartphone could be rotated to any position, including the shape of video cameras of that time. Shooting video in this way is quite convenient, although the camera itself was not surprising. The manufacturer installed a VGA matrix with the ability to record video. Inside the smartphone is 6 MB of memory + a slot for RS-MMC cards. The rest of the multimedia features were on par with the Nokia 6600. Despite its poor performance, Nokia 6260 received a lot of attention from demanding fashion lovers. This stylish and cute smartphone spawned a whole trend and is considered the father of the legendary Nokia N90, N92, N93, N93i. Nokia 9500/9300 The Nokia Communicator series continued to develop in parallel with compact smartphones. The Nokia 9500 model was an excellent and compact update, followed by the cheaper 9300 version. The principle of the device’s operation has not changed, and it represented two separate platforms working simultaneously. For calls and basic needs, the Nokia 9500 was used as a classic phone when folded, and when unfolded, the device turned into a mini laptop. The Symbian OS 7.0 interface in these models was modified and optimized to work with the ultra-wide 4.5-inch display. The resolution of 640×200 pixels was equally impressive. The rest of the features were also on point: 80 MB of internal memory expandable by MMC cards, a built-in VGA camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, an infrared port, an HTML browser, and a powerful battery. The Nokia 9500 did not claim to be a mass-market device, but it was in great demand among business and wealthy people. The mere presence of a device of this class in 2004 said a lot about its owner, namely the status, size of the wallet, and level of technical awareness. The cheaper version, the Nokia 9300, had several technological differences. The smaller display, lack of a camera, and weaker battery did not become an obstacle, and the company later released the updated Nokia 9300i, which was in greater demand than the flagship Nokia 9500. Nokia 7110 The phenomenal touchscreen flagship with the best screen on the market deservedly appears on today’s list, as it was literally ahead of technological progress. The Nokia 7710 appeared at the end of 2004 and had a space price, so it could not become a popular favorite. The Symbian 7.0 touchscreen interface was modified to work with a large widescreen and was called the Series 90. Later on, this direction was almost not developed, so Nokia 7710 can be confidently considered the first and last successful smartphone of this class. It could be controlled with a stylus or the navigation key. The system interface is small, so you can immediately forget about the comfort of working with your finger, as in modern smartphones, but it held a lot of information. At that time, touchscreen phones with large displays were valued among serious people, not among young fans of vertical videos on TikTok, as they are now. In addition to the 640×320 3.5-inch display, the device’s hardware was no less impressive. At the heart of the phone is a 168 MHz TI OMAP 1510 processor, 90 MB of ROM, and an MMC memory card slot. A 128 MB card was already included. The multimedia capabilities had no limits — Nokia 7710 allowed you to watch movies, listen to music or FM radio. The browser was one of the best on the market and supported Flash 6. The pre-installed office suite and a full set of useful utilities were used to view and edit documents, and the 1 MP camera produced good quality pictures for the time. The Nokia 7710 was a compromise solution, as it didn’t have Wi-Fi, was expensive, and had a far from low entry threshold. The device competed with serious OS-based solutions from Microsoft and Palm, and after unsuccessful attempts to move into this segment, Nokia focused on push-button phones, which was a big mistake before the advent of the most popular device in history — the Apple iPhone. Siemens CX65/CX70 German Siemens phones remained the real national favorites, as they offered the best functionality for the money. Unstable software, mediocre performance, and other nuances did not matter because Siemens CX65/CX70 were the kings of their price segment. They decided to combine these models because they were almost identical functionally. The phone had 10 MB of memory, a large 2.1-inch screen, and a VGA camera that could record videos up to 30 seconds. Functionally, it appears to be nothing wonderful, but there is one serious advantage that made the Siemens CX70 a popular favorite. The phone’s firmware was as open as you could imagine. The device has a built-in file manager, a generous set of pre-installed programs, and the best infrared port capabilities on the market. The fact is that the Siemens CX70 (and other models of the manufacturer) were able to wirelessly transfer already installed programs and games. Even Sony Ericsson could not boast of this. It was the ratio of characteristics to price that became a decisive factor in the massive popularity of the Siemens CX65 and its improved version, the CX70. A year later, the phone received another update in the form of the CXV70 with a dedicated key for the browser, and also had a version of the M65 with a protected case. All of them were popular among young people for obvious reasons — an affordable, functional phone that didn’t suit only MP3 music fans. Siemens SK65 Phones with QWERTY keyboards were becoming more and more popular, but this made them too wide. Siemens engineers decided to outsmart the system by creating the Siemens SK65 with a rotary split keyboard. This unique design didn’t become a breakthrough or popular, but the courage of the developers deserves respect. The Siemens SK65 attracted the attention of others, and the owner enjoyed convenient message dialing. Since the model was aimed at the corporate segment, it was not equipped with a camera. The rest of the Siemens SK65’s characteristics were at an average level: 2.1-inch screen, 64 MB of internal memory, Bluetooth 1.2, and an integrated email client. Siemens SX66 Toward the end of 2004, the German manufacturer surprised everyone with one of the most powerful smartphones of the time. The Siemens SX66 was ahead of its time and made all other smartphones look like children’s toys. At the heart of the device is an Intel Xscale PXA272 processor with an incredibly high frequency of 520 MHz. At the time, owners of top-end Nokia models could only dream of such a powerful chip, although Finnish models used a much lighter operating system. There is 128 MB of internal memory + an MCC expansion slot. The set of wireless interfaces included Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and an infrared port. The Siemens SX66 featured Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003 SE PocketPC operating system, a built-in document viewer, a full HTML browser, a QWERTY keyboard, and a large 3.5-inch screen with a resolution of 240×320 pixels. The phone could be operated using a stylus or the navigation key. Despite these characteristics, the Siemens SX66 did not become a mass market device because it did not have a camera, required good technical knowledge to fully utilize the system’s capabilities, and was too expensive for the average consumer. A highly specialized, compromise, but mighty smartphone that became one of the last premium products from Siemens. Samsung D500 Until 2004, the Korean company felt weak against Nokia simply because it did not offer good flagships, but the Samsung D500 changed everything. This slider became a one-stop solution for those who were looking for an image phone with maximum functionality and a luxurious look. A huge 96 MB of memory partially compensated for the lack of memory cards. In fact, this storage was enough for most users at the time, as typical memory cards rarely exceeded 32-64 MB, and larger capacities were expensive. In addition to a good TFT display, the Samsung D500 boasted a 1.3 MP camera with flash and support for popular media file formats. The Samsung D500 gained popularity not because of its good features, but because of its luxurious design, well-built body, and elegant appearance. The popularity of sliders has been growing every year, and the example of this model clarified that this form factor is best suited for high-end premium devices. Despite the peculiar limitations of the software, the Samsung D500 became a real hit, which allowed the company to earn good capital to invest in new developments. This legendary phone received a direct continuation a year later, as well as a reincarnation in the form of the Samsung X700, which we will discuss in the next issue. Samsung i700 The company did not forget about the parallel development of handheld computers, offering top-of-the-line PDAs for business people. The belated Samsung i700 model was released with a significant delay in the first quarter of 2004, but it did not look outdated. It was a pleasure to work on the large touchscreen with a stylus, as the display held an incredible amount of information. The best Symbian smartphones couldn’t offer anything like that, except for the Series 90, so Microsoft’s system was steadily gaining momentum in the corporate segment. The smartphone received a swiveling VGA camera, a powerful 400 MHz Intel processor, a gigantic display, 32 MB of RAM, 32 MB of ROM, and a memory card slot. Functionally, the Samsung i700 could replace a computer, as it had Pocket Office and an HTML browser on board, although there were some serious compromises. The Samsung i700 lacked a Wi-Fi module, so only 2G communication was used for communication. This smartphone did not gain much popularity, but it laid a solid foundation for a whole line of future Samsung hits, such as the i710, i740, i900, i8000 and other Windows Mobile smartphones. Samsung P730 The Korean Transformer was released in early 2004 and immediately became a media sensation. The unique design with a swivel screen and a huge navigation key attracted the attention of the press and fashion lovers, but not only for its appearance. In addition to its unusual shape, the Samsung P730 offered flagship features. Inside, there was 64 MB of memory + RS-MMC card slot, a megapixel camera with CIF video recording, a large main TFD screen and an additional OLED screen. It was one of the first mass-market phones to successfully use an organic matrix. Overall, the Samsung P730 was not a super flagship, but its amazing design, photo, and music capabilities (thanks to the memory subsystem) made it popular among affluent young people. The phone became one of the first and one of the last successful examples of combining a rotary and clamshell in one case, so it definitely deserves a respectable place in history. LG G1800 This budget model with MP3 support became a real hit for LG at that time. Listening to high-quality music was costly at the time because even a good player cost a lot, as did memory cards. The LG G1800 turned out to be accurately what music-loving students needed, as it offered everything they needed for a very reasonable price. The lack of a memory card slot was compensated by the built-in 64 MB of storage. The software was rather limited, especially disappointing was the lack of Java, although several built-in games were installed. The LG G1800 turned out to be a surprising compromise, but popular among music fans, becoming a real salvation in the period of expensive Flash memory and the inaccessibility of MP3 in the budget segment. Philips 755 Basic functionality with mediocre performance was no longer a surprise at the beginning of 2004, but the Philips 755 had a serious trick up its sleeve in the form of a touchscreen with a proprietary stylus. The small size of the display did not prevent you from drawing accurately and sending your images via MMS, e-mail or infrared. Before that, photos taken with the VGA camera could be edited by adding something like a signature, a mustache for a friend, or a heart for a loved one. The Philips 755 was a great budget solution with adequate functionality, ample internal memory, and incredible creativity — in addition to the drawing program, this model had a built-in music composer. A few years would pass and resistive displays would become more popular, manufacturers would abandon keys in favor of a large screen area, and then the phone that changed the world, the Apple iPhone, would appear. The problem with the early «competitors» iPhone was that it was inconvenient to use a touchscreen display without keys, and the Philips 755 successfully combined the two input methods. Despite the popularity of the notional Nokia 5800 (2008), it was terrible to use, which is not the case with the successful Philips series. For some time, the company produced models similar to the Philips 755, which were in demand among young people. Despite the mediocre performance, it was prestigious to have such a device at the time, and most importantly, not too expensive. Blackberry 8700c The Blackberry 8700c didn’t offer top multimedia features, but it was considered the best device for email. In 2004, QWERTY keyboards were rarely installed by other manufacturers, so Blackberry was confidently selling in this segment. At the end of 2004, Blackberry 8700c was released with a huge 2.6-inch screen with a resolution of 320×240 pixels. In addition to the functions of an Internet communicator, the Blackberry 8700c was one of the fastest smartphones in its class, as it was equipped with a top-end Intel PXA901 312 MHz processor and 16 MB of RAM. 20 years ago, there was no device that could directly replace the Blackberry 8700c, especially the comfortable keyboard (except for Palm). The incredible success of «Blueberry» made manufacturers reconsider their plans, so very soon there will be many analogues from well-known companies in a similar form factor. We’ll talk about Samsung i320, Nokia E61 and other QWERTY hits in the next issue, but for now, it’s worth mentioning another top device with a full keyboard. Palm Treo 650 This model is considered to be the most successful Palm phone of all time. After its predecessor Treo 600, it received an incredible performance boost, an improved screen, and a newer version of the operating system. The Palm Treo 650 had a few technical shortcomings, but was in demand due to the excellent combination of software and hardware. The presence of a gigantic library of Palm OS software made the Palm Treo 650 a real multimedia combine and office machine in one. The smartphone digested any multimedia formats of the time, and watching videos on the 190 PPI screen was a real pleasure. The built-in memory of 23 MB could be expanded up to 2 GB with SD cards, which allowed you to store thousands of photos and tens of hours of video from the VGA camera. The Palm Treo 650 finally got a Bluetooth module, which was so lacking in the previous model, but there was still no Wi-Fi. The legendary Palm Treo 650 was distinguished from its Symbian and Windows Mobile competitors by the perfect combination of a QWERTY keyboard and touch screen. Most analogs did not offer anything like this, and Palm OS can be used as you like, with fast typing on the keyboard. It’s a pity that it never got a decent sequel a year later. In a year or two, competitors will realize all the advantages of this form factor and bring their models to the market, which we will definitely mention in the next issue. The Palm Treo 650, along with its predecessors, gave rise to a whole class of devices that could have become dominant if not for the emergence of the Apple iPhone, but three years before its release, no one was worried about a potential threat from the apple company. Back then, the market lived by different concepts, producing devices for a specific target audience based on consumer needs. It was a time when smartphones were truly smart devices for smart people, not for endless consumption of content on a large touchscreen that contributes to the development of attention deficit disorder, depression, and addiction to small doses of dopamine. In the next issue of 2005, we’ll take a look at the most interesting models and talk about hard drives in phones, the reasons for Symbian’s collapse with the transition to a new kernel, and the revolution in mobile photography led by the best proprietary phone ever made.",https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/World_Before_Apple_iPhone_10-2-itc-hq-height-1080px.jpeg,2024-04-17,0.179,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Siemens', 'latitude': 46.47494888305664, 'longitude': -90.10350799560547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nokia', 'latitude': 61.447120666503906, 'longitude': 23.37717056274414, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Samsung', 'latitude': 36.39739990234375, 'longitude': 127.7323989868164, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Java', 'latitude': 42.39971923828125, 'longitude': 43.936668395996094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'LED', 'latitude': 59.16667175292969, 'longitude': 15.466670036315918, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Phillips', 'latitude': 40.8972282409668, 'longitude': -98.21478271484375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'TOP', 'latitude': 43.625, 'longitude': 21.571109771728516, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Palm', 'latitude': 47.633331298828125, 'longitude': 16.116670608520508, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Blackberry', 'latitude': 36.716800689697266, 'longitude': -80.03865814208984, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ROM', 'latitude': 41.89474105834961, 'longitude': 12.48390007019043, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Flash', 'latitude': 53.201141357421875, 'longitude': -1.963320016860962, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'RAM', 'latitude': 44.8114013671875, 'longitude': 21.333599090576172, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philips', 'latitude': 30.30023956298828, 'longitude': -81.6414794921875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Basic', 'latitude': 38.87186813354492, 'longitude': -117.90010833740234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Intel', 'latitude': 37.38793182373047, 'longitude': -121.96353912353516, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 18 Apr 2024 08:15:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JyaWVkLWFwcGxlLXN0b2NrLW5vdy1jb21wYW55cy0wODE1MDA5MjcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance,"The headlines certainly seem alarming. Reports are coming out showing that iPhone sales fell 10% year over year in 2024's first quarter. The setback was so stark, in fact, that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) lost the top spot in the world's smartphone market share race that it held just a quarter earlier! As is too often the case, though, such headlines fail to include a great deal of important context. Here's the rest of what you need to know about this week's news before deciding whether you need to dump your stake in Apple stock. The iPhone loses its top spot ... again The data comes from technology market research outfit IDC. In its most recent look at worldwide smartphone shipments, it reported that Apple delivered 50.1 million iPhones during the three months ending in March. That's 10 million fewer than the number Samsung (OTC: SSNL.F) delivered in the same quarter. That's also a marked difference from the final quarter of last year when 80.5 million iPhones were shipped versus Samsung's count of 53 million. This market-share shift led Reuters to write a story with the headline ""Apple loses top phonemaker spot to Samsung as iPhone shipments drop."" Bloomberg's headline ""Apple faces worst iPhone slump since Covid as rivals rise"" is even more worrisome. To be fair, both headlines are technically accurate. However, there are a couple of relevant details worth expounding on. The first of these details is simply that this shift isn't abnormal. Apple is usually displaced as the global smartphone market leader between the fourth quarter and the following Q1. In fact, as the image below illustrates, in seven out of the past eight years Apple has lost its Q4 market share lead to Samsung during the following Q1. Why? The iPhone is a popular gift during the holiday shopping season. Samsung smartphones aren't. Samsung-made smartphones are, however, historically better sellers over the course of a full year. The other detail worth understanding is a semi-related one. That is, Apple started Q1 2024 at a disadvantage. People's response to the Q4 2023 release of the iPhone 15 was so strong that there weren't many interested buyers who didn't already own one by Q1. Also bear in mind that a handful of analysts -- including Morgan Stanley's -- suggest many iPhone fans may be holding out for the iPhone 16 that's likely to debut later this year. That's just a guess, of course, but not an unreasonable one given that a lot of actively used iPhones are now several years old. Indeed, the iPhone 11 -- released in 2019 -- is still the world's most used iPhone, according to a recent report from Scientiamobile. Since these devices are now nearly five years old, their owners won't be able to wait much longer to make the upgrade. Scientiamobile's data adds that the iPhone 12 and 13 are also now the second- and third-most used Apple smartphones. They're quickly approaching the end of their useful lives too. Not a reason to dump your Apple stock Don't read too much bullishness into these added details. Apple's still got some tough challenges ahead, to be sure. Just look at the bigger picture as an example. Even though Q4 iPhone sales were strong, the longer-term trend is a stagnant one. The company's not really shipping any more iPhones now than it was several years ago. iPhone revenue itself has been similarly stagnant since late 2020 as well, with the average selling price of the iPhone arguably reaching its peak. Given that about half of Apple's top line comes from sales of the iPhone, there's cause for concern. But the situation isn't quite as dire as this week's headlines would suggest. A subpar Apple is still a stronger company and a better investment prospect than plenty of other corporations on their best days. If nothing else, Apple is a cash-generating juggernaut. It can buy whatever growth it may no longer be able to create organically. That's the long way of saying Apple's Q1 smartphone stumble isn't nearly as big a deal as it's being made out to be in some of these headlines. There may be better options out there, but you could certainly do a lot worse than sticking with this one for a while longer. Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?

Apple CEO says company will 'look at' manufacturing in Indonesia - Yahoo Finance,Apple CEO says company will 'look at' manufacturing in Indonesia  Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 09:30:37 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS1jZW8tc2F5cy1jb21wYW55LWxvb2tpbmctMDUwODAwMzY3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company will “look at” manufacturing in Indonesia as he met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday. “We talked about the president’s desire to see manufacturing in the country, and it’s something that we will look at,” Cook told reporters after the meeting. Widodo’s administration has worked for years to bring manufacturing to the country to power economic development, while Apple is seeking to diversify its supply chains away from China, where most of its smartphones and tablets are assembled. The company began moving some production to countries like Vietnam, and more recently India, after shutdowns to fight COVID-19 in China repeatedly disrupted the company’s shipments. “I think the investment ability in Indonesia is endless. I think that, there is a lot of great places to invest, and we’re investing. We believe in the country,” Cook said. The previous day, Cook met Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi, where he said Apple plans to invest more in Vietnam and increase spending on suppliers in the Southeast Asian manufacturing hub. “Given the slowing Chinese economy as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing efforts to squeeze out foreign companies and replace them with domestic brands, Apple wants alternatives for manufacturing,” said Chris Miller, an associate professor at Tufts University whose work focuses on technology and geopolitics. “It has already invested more in India and Vietnam, but it is likely looking at other partners in South East Asia to additional manufacturing and assembly operations,” Miller said. Cook's visit to Indonesia came after Apple announced its fourth Apple Developer Academy in the country, to be located in Bali. The company first launched the program to train app developers in Indonesia in 2018, in the capital Jakarta. Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia, but the company says it has invested 1.6 trillion rupiah ($99 million) in its app developer ecosystem in the country. Widodo's government has sought to leverage the country's reserves of nickel and other raw materials to bring in manufacturing, banning export of raw commodities such as nickel and bauxite to oblige companies to build refineries domestically. After the meeting with Widodo, Cook also met Indonesia’s president-elect Prabowo Subianto, who is currently defense minister, in Jakarta. He's set to take power in October. Indonesia’s minister of communication and information, Budi Arie Setiadi, said Wednesday that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella would visit Indonesia at the end of April. ___ Associated Press writers Victoria Milko in Jakarta and Zen Soo in Hong Kong contributed to this report.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cCwq8A9RLlH2PraKVq7.lg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/522e363b7a9749371de5f8aebac4d952,2024-04-17,0.025,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Chris Miller', 'description': 'American football player', 'full_name': 'Chris Miller', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Atlanta_Falcons_at_Los_Angeles_Rams_1991-12-08_-_01_%28Atlanta_Falcons_crop%29.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'JAKARTA', 'latitude': -6.214620113372803, 'longitude': 106.84513092041016, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Indonesia', 'latitude': -5.0, 'longitude': 120.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127498626708984, 'longitude': -95.4175033569336, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cook', 'latitude': 39.547218322753906, 'longitude': -97.61197662353516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Widodo', 'latitude': -7.323060035705566, 'longitude': 111.06139373779297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'China', 'latitude': 35.0, 'longitude': 105.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Vietnam', 'latitude': 16.166669845581055, 'longitude': 107.83332824707031, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'India', 'latitude': 20.0, 'longitude': 77.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hanoi', 'latitude': 21.024499893188477, 'longitude': 105.84117126464844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tufts University', 'latitude': 42.404541015625, 'longitude': -71.11978149414062, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'South East Asia', 'latitude': 11.005900382995605, 'longitude': 109.16000366210938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Miller', 'latitude': 36.41645812988281, 'longitude': -94.26437377929688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Academy', 'latitude': 37.6440315246582, 'longitude': -77.36637115478516, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bali', 'latitude': -8.5, 'longitude': 115.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Jakarta', 'latitude': -6.214620113372803, 'longitude': 106.84513092041016, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Microsoft', 'latitude': 47.63959884643555, 'longitude': -122.12844848632812, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hong Kong', 'latitude': 22.285520553588867, 'longitude': 114.1576919555664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo to discuss manufacturing in Indonesia.

Two buildings acquired in 2022, which are next to its existing offices, will undergo a major upgrade. This will bring “three unique spaces together to foster greater collaboration for Apple’s growing teams”, the tech giant said in a statement on Wednesday. Construction is slated to start this year. Singapore serves as a central operations centre for Apple in the region and is a hub for critical roles in software, hardware, services and support. Apple CEO Tim Cook mulls first manufacturing facility in Indonesia “The new expansion is the latest milestone in Apple’s over four decades of work fostering job creation and deep connections with the local community, and will provide space for growth and new roles in artificial intelligence and other key functions,” said Apple.

According to Apple, it supports more than 60,000 jobs through direct employment, its supply chain and the IOS app economy. There are three Apple Store locations in Singapore. With our growing campus, Apple is writing a new chapter in our history here. Our Singapore teams have played an important role in enriching the lives of our customers Tim Cook, Apple CEO The company has also upgraded its facilities and labs over the last 10 years, including growing space in its hardware technologies centre by 50 per cent since 2019. Apple CEO Tim Cook said: “Singapore is truly a one-of-a-kind place, and we are proud of the connection we’ve built with this dynamic community of creators, learners, and dreamers.” “With our growing campus, Apple is writing a new chapter in our history here. Our Singapore teams have played an important role in enriching the lives of our customers – and we can’t wait for many more decades of innovation to come.” Like all its facilities, the expanded campus will run completely on renewable energy, the company said. It has been carbon-neutral for its corporate operations since 2020 and has run all of its facilities using 100 per cent renewable energy since 2018. On Wednesday, Apple’s CEO also said the company will look into building a manufacturing facility in Indonesia, following a meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo.

That’s why it matters that the company wants to use 100% recycled rare earth materials in its products. The iPhone 15 range uses 100% recycled cobalt in smartphone batteries. These valuable materials are often described as “conflict minerals,” because they come from active war zones and are often mined at gunpoint by forced labor — including kids. I suppose that Just as Find My iPhone makes stealing Apple’s phones less attractive, dramatic reductions in demand for such minerals might well make even forced labor less profitable. Apple wants carbon offset transparency The company has lots of reasons to take pride in much of what it has achieved to mitigate the consequences of running its business, but not every process or use can be avoided or reduced. To make up for this, Apple makes big use of carbon credits. A lot of people don’t have much faith in carbon credits as a route to environmental sustainability, which Apple seems to recognize. Not only does it call its use of these an “interim solution,” but stresses that its priority is to reduce emissions rather than rely on that kind of mitigation. To me, this means Apple’s reliance on carbon credits is the weakest link in the Apple 2030 story. But the fact the company sees it as an interim solution and its investment of over $200 million in high quality offset projects such as those in Africa’s Chyulu Hills or in Guizhou, China show tangible recognition of this. Apple also gains some brownie points for transparency on its use of carbon offsets because it has published an extensive white paper explaining its approach in a great deal more depth. This includes some key recommendations to perhaps improve the quality of such projects on an industry-wide basis.",https://www.computerworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Apple-environmental-innovations-wind-turbines.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,2024-04-16,-0.243,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Africa', 'latitude': 35.50471878051758, 'longitude': 11.062219619750977, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chyulu Hills', 'latitude': -2.667570114135742, 'longitude': 37.87948989868164, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Guizhou', 'latitude': 27.0, 'longitude': 107.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'China', 'latitude': 35.0, 'longitude': 105.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not directly related,"Apple aims to use 100% recycled rare earth materials in its products, including cobalt in iPhone 15 batteries.

AI Business has reached out to Apple for comment. The company has been looking to ramp up generative AI efforts in the wake of ChatGPT.

This marks a significant milestone, with record investment commitments exceeding Rs 10,000 crore, as many companies plan to invest more than Rs 500 crore each.Industry experts believe the number of new plants has reduced compared to the Covid period, but the state is getting ultra-modern export-oriented plants.H G Koshia, commissioner of Gujarat state FDCA, said, “We have approved 133 new allopathic medicine plants in the last financial year, the highest in India. This underscores Gujarat’s position as a pharmaceutical hub, and these plants are poised to commence operations soon.” Since March 2019, a total of 627 new plants have been approved in Gujarat, indicating its journey towards becoming a pharmacy to the world.“The FDCA approved 199 projects in 2020-21, 156 projects in 2021-22 and 139 projects in 2022-23. In terms of investments, 2023-24 has been the best. We expect investments of more than Rs 10,000 crore for new plants. The highest commitment of Rs 2,200 crore has been made by a multi-national company while several others plan to invest at least Rs 500 crore each to set up new plants in the state.”Moreover, the last Vibrant Gujarat summit witnessed over 270 MoUs valued at approximately Rs 38,000 crore, with companies expected to submit their plans post land acquisition.A director of a leading pharmaceutical company said, “Gujarat boasts over 28% share in pharmaceutical manufacturing in the country and around 31% share in pharmaceutical exports. The state offers an entire ecosystem conducive to the pharmaceutical industry, attracting companies to its fold.” He added that the steady growth rate and turnover-based business model of the industry entice non-pharma players to enter the sector.The implementation of GST has levelled the playing field for the Gujarat pharmaceutical industry, making the state an attractive destination for investments. “New plants are specifically designed for exports, targeting highly regulated markets such as the US and Europe,” he added.We also published the following articles recentlyPharmaceutical company Bayer planning to oust bosses, asks workers to 'self-organize'Bayer, under CEO Bill Anderson, restructures by cutting middle managers to save 2 billion euros.

Key Facts The iPhone 12 will only come with a USB-C to Lightning cable for charging. You'll have to buy a $19 USB-C charging brick separately if you want to use the cable in the box, though you can still charge your phone with any old iPhone charger with a Lightning connector. Earpods will cost another $19 if you don't already have a pair or use wireless Airpods. Apple says the move is part of the company's effort to become 100% carbon neutral by 2030. Removing accessories, Apple says, will use fewer raw materials and thinner packaging, which allows Apple to put 70% more units on a single shipping pallet to reduce carbon emissions. Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president for environment policy and social initiatives, suggested Tuesday that many customers already have Apple's wired headphones and charging bricks, saying 700 million Earpods and 2 billion power adapters have already been sold. Chief Critics Some criticized Apple for using the environment as an excuse to increase margins and lower shipping costs, especially because Apple isn't also lowering prices. CNET noted the move may be a way to offset the costs of including ultrawide 5G support, which usually pushes up phone prices even higher. But many assailed Apple for forcing customers to buy yet another accessory. ""Apple has found yet another way to force you to buy an expensive dongle/adapter for its expensive gadgets in order to make said gadgets work,"" Jason Koebler of Vice wrote.

In an interview with TOI, Kewat, known as the 'encounter mastermind', shared details of the operation that led to the death of 29 Maoists. The encounter was meticulously planned, leveraging intelligence and a stealthy approach by a 200-strong team of BSF and DRG personnel. Despite the challenging terrain and the Maoists' familiarity with the jungle, Kewat's forces managed to get within 300 meters of the enemy camp. The operation escalated when the Maoists were alerted, leading to an intense firefight. Kewat, who has stopped counting individual kills, remains focused on capturing key Maoist figures. His experience and leadership were pivotal in the success of the operation.

Apple Aims to Reclaim Top Spot with AI Integration Amid Declining Sales - Cryptopolitan,Apple Aims to Reclaim Top Spot with AI Integration Amid Declining Sales  Cryptopolitan,"Thu, 18 Apr 2024 13:14:42 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyeXB0b3BvbGl0YW4uY29tL2FwcGxlLWFpbXMtdG8tcmVjbGFpbS10b3Atc3BvdC13aXRoLWFpL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Cryptopolitan,"One of the most significant barriers that the tech giant Apple company, which has been considered the creator of tech-perfect gadgets, faces is the reality that it’s facing two real challenges. First of all, it is necessary to point out that China is the donor of the conflict and is willing to preserve its status as the leader of the world economy. First and foremost is the GenAI, whose AI (advanced Artificial Intelligence type) is integrated with this where GenAI serves as a developing source and GenAI-the with this advanced Artificial Intelligence AI. Not as bad as the worst, according to IDC (International Data Corporation), but bad enough to make this announcement a tough one to deliver. There was a significant drop in the market share fruit of the iPhone during this period; it was 9.6% lower compared to the results of the first quarter of 2040. The situation may taste bittersweet because Samsung managed to win this world bonus of winning sales market share with up to 50 million units sold. In comparison, Apple only accounts for about 46 million units. Geopolitical tensions and the GenAI gap contribute to sales decline Firstly, these two drivers, which are iPhone and iPad sales’ fall and increased growth of consumers in those areas particularly, are the biggest to the redness shift of Apple’s revenue. Those in-recessing trade tiffs between the US and China have largely been global people’s existence as the results have been long. Notwithstanding that Apple is fighting mobile market giants, the Chinese consumer has the flexibility to choose from various brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and others. Apple sales units decreased because of the government’s strict fight with the local brands, which attracted consumers by creating a bad image in which Apple lost its originality, which affected its revenue sheets. Apple, Inc., as for the AI market, is not working for a particular one with many institutions. It can become the industry leader, distancing itself from the competition among the other companies. It produces a notion that Apple is not taking any risks in not only the adoption of the aggressive counter-strategy but also even in the considerable amount of investment in its technologies by which it pours its home-brewed technology into a product, in the greatest competition; Samsung already stands out and is now side by side with the other players’ competitors. Apple’s opportunity: Developer conference and AI integration However, the problems will persist even though developers will attend the Apple conference in late June; the new trend will be guided in how they overcome them and how the market will remain fair and even. This A+ also unveils so much of the other side of the problem when upgrading to OS versions. On the other hand, I would expect the product they will release to the market to be processed with the facet of the enhanced natural ingredient and even contain artificial. Gen AI features that go to the full extent. On the other hand, the points may talk about functionalities, and the constituent items may be text-writing generation, text translation, video transcription, and image-based generation. Besides, we can also say that iOS performance depends on the availability of a more powerful processor in the hardware that offers super fast and high-timing performance. Consequently, the new iPhones that are marveled at as the masterpiece of smartphone products for the high-end sector will come with super smart AI, which will be housed in the device as the high-end computational capabilities of the processor provide high power. A decisive response and potential turnaround The uncertainties surrounding a dramatic uptick in your current revenue numbers, accompanied by challenging quarters ahead, caution against ignoring such possibilities. Thus, this should be enough to steer you away from fretting over diversion from GenAI’s development prospects. However, by 2020, if Apple succeeds in building a superior GenAI that duly takes over the market, this constellation is the possible scenario that sees product growth. However, this may cause people to feel very bad about the company and make it fail to return to its position in the market before. Therefore, It would be necessary to display the company`s positive side by demonstrating the company’s new products well, after which it will be capable of winning back the position of the smartphone market leader. This competition can take many different directions, such as spreading demand to other wafer makers or creating an extreme chain of associations, as the intricacy of the product range and the extent of a global market will be considered. Coca-Cola must prepare itself to create innovative strategies to tackle the changing market shifts. Looking for a pencil with writing virtually any issue? Make your output more like human speech using our AI tool! We’ll kick off the change of discourse by showing how our demo can shift the narrative. This is why both Tapovan and GalnAI are employed in their products, thereby making the company’s product maintain its technology market when the products are being sold or during the marketing of their products. Now, the market, which was disjointed before, has become stronger. However, it might have lost its responsiveness because of restructuring by Ms. Nabila Popal, IDC’s global tracker research analyst. Also, the meaning of Bluetooth headgear changes from an ordinary device to an accessory to the consumer thus, the replacement cost of the devices seems to be worth saving the Consumers, generally, tend to utilize the devices for a considerable period, meaning the gear that is traveling with them can be repeatedly used. On the same token, Ryan Reith, vice-president and worldwide mobility consumer devices tracker at IDC—a renowned technology research and advisory firm, argues that Huawei will expand and branch out to another market beyond its shores in a bid to create solutions for the problem that is mainly limited to the Chinese market that is rather similar to the other home markets of OEMs such as vivo By the end of recovery, the Biggest Firms might appear at the helm of affairs since they will practically bite through other leaders to re-acquire a market leadership position. At the same time, newbies will also have difficulty fitting into the game of big companies. The main reason that can decide the strength of Apple and the rate of its acceptance compared to the competitors would be the speed of Apple’s evolutionary market and the idea that the strong brand is significantly integrated into it.

More good science fiction for Apple TV+: one of its greatest hits is preparing to film several seasons in a row - Gearrice,More good science fiction for Apple TV+: one of its greatest hits is preparing to film several seasons in a row  Gearrice,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 09:10:06 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZWFycmljZS5jb20vdXBkYXRlL21vcmUtZ29vZC1zY2llbmNlLWZpY3Rpb24tZm9yLWFwcGxlLXR2LW9uZS1vZi1pdHMtZ3JlYXRlc3QtaGl0cy1pcy1wcmVwYXJpbmctdG8tZmlsbS1zZXZlcmFsLXNlYXNvbnMtaW4tYS1yb3cv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Gearrice,"Almost a year ago we started enjoying ‘Silo’ on Apple TV+. It is a dystopian science fiction series based on an underground society that has dazzled many viewers and critics. Its curtain temporarily lowered on June 30 with the broadcast of its tenth chapter, although with new episodes already confirmed. We knew that the second season would arrive this year and now, thanks to its leading actress, we have learned that there will surely be two more seasons and that both will be recorded consecutively. This is something that, although logical in view of Rebecca Ferguson’s statements, had not been confirmed by Apple. A closed ending for ‘Silo’ and that could arrive next year At the end of last year and after a lengthy writers’ strike, many series and films resumed filming. One of them was ‘Silo’, which was facing the final part of the recording of its second season, a priori composed of another ten episodes like the first. However, we do not always have accurate data about dates and when actresses like the protagonist Rebecca Ferguson talk about it, it is always interesting. The Juliette Nichols of fiction gave an interview to Collider in which she clearly stated that the second season is ready. At least recorded. We don’t know if it will continue in the post-production phase, but even if so, it shouldn’t take too long. In the absence of confirmation, it is expected that the second season of ‘Silo’ will end up arriving this summer (or in the fall, if Apple TV+ wants to leave it as one of the stars of the new season). Something to highlight is that ‘Silo’ is a series based on ‘Chronicles of the Silo’, a series of three books that is divided into four and which is precisely what would give rise to the series having an identical division. This was confirmed by Ferguson in his statements to Collider: “I think the series has an end and I know when it will be. That’s the answer. You’ll find out when the show ends. To be honest, I think it’s not a secret. The books are the books. There are three books and the three books are divided in four seasons, so I think that, unless someone at Apple changes their mind, we are completely in agreement in saying that season 1 is fine. Season 2 is filmed and about to premiere, and now we are looking to greenlight the. seasons 3 and 4. And I think maybe we’ll film them together, and that would be the end.” As we said in the introduction, these words from the actress are loaded with logic without the need for Apple to confirm it. However, in a somewhat unstable time in streaming and with sudden cancellations, the fact that the apple company has not said otherwise indicates that they are satisfied with ‘Silo’ and that, indeed, there will be four seasons. Rebecca Ferguson talks about the possibility of recording the last two seasons in a row and, despite the difficulties that this would entail for production, as she herself confirms elsewhere in the interview, the truth is that it could serve to see that hypothetical ending next year. It would all depend on when this mega filming started, of course. It is also not ruled out that they will go to one per year and that the third will come out in 2025 and in 2026 the one that will see the light will be that fourth and final season.

These devices were taken in by Apple for trade or recycling and many were in working condition and could have been factory reset, refurbished, and sold in the used smartphone market. According to Bloomberg (via 9to5Mac), Apple discovered that at least 99,975 of these iPhones were shipped by GEEP to China where they were sold on the used device market in that country. In 2020, a breach of contract suit against GEEP was filed by Apple, but there has been no follow-up on the part of the tech giant. The suit will be automatically dropped in January 2025 if Apple doesn't continue to move forward with its legal action. In August 2024, a lawsuit filed by GEEP against three former employees believed to be responsible for the theft of the iPhone units will also be dropped automatically. So why would Apple, which sent GEEP more than 530,000 iPhones, 25,000 iPads, and 19,000 Apple Watches to dispose of in the first two years of their contract, decide not to pursue legal action in what might be an easy legal victory? It would appear that Apple did not want the public to learn that it scrapped hundreds of thousands of working iPhone units to prevent these phones from taking away sales of higher-priced new iPhone models. As noted by Bloomberg, many of the iPhones that Apple paid to be scrapped were prime candidates to be refurbished. The actions that Apple tasked GEEP with would contradict its statement saying that ""reuse is our first choice."" The company also made public a goal to reach 100% carbon neutrality for its product life cycle by 2030. You might recall Apple's recycling robot ""Daisy,"" which disassembles hundreds of older and unwanted iPhone handsets each hour and collects usable parts from these handsets. Bloomberg's article suggests that showing off Daisy to the press was merely an attempt by Apple to generate positive public relations. The report notes that at the same time Apple was introducing Daisy to the Netherlands, a person employed by Apple recycling partner Re-Teck, claims to have witnessed tons of AirPods, Apple Watches, and Macs get crushed. Many of the devices, which appeared to be in good shape, were whacked at and scrapped by Re-Tech employees wielding hammers. While the optics might not be good for Apple, scrapping devices that could be refurbished is not a crime although iFixit co-founder Kyle Wiens believes that such action should be made illegal.",https://m-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/157487-wide-two_1200/Why-Apple-wont-sue-the-company-that-stole-100K-iPhones-eventually-sold-in-China.jpg,2024-04-18,-0.657,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'iFixit', 'description': 'company', 'full_name': 'iFixit', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/IFixit_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 51.14950180053711, 'longitude': -2.7174699306488037, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mac', 'latitude': 53.259498596191406, 'longitude': -2.1217000484466553, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'China', 'latitude': 35.0, 'longitude': 105.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Daisy', 'latitude': 34.06760025024414, 'longitude': -85.95747375488281, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Netherlands', 'latitude': 52.5, 'longitude': 5.75, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Teck', 'latitude': 48.606231689453125, 'longitude': 9.47245979309082, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Macs', 'latitude': 47.58332824707031, 'longitude': 21.5, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tech', 'latitude': 20.950000762939453, 'longitude': -75.96666717529297, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"Apple scrapped hundreds of thousands of working iPhones to prevent competition with new models, contradicting its environmental claims.

According to the Apple company, China's internet regulator ordered the company to remove Meta's apps due to concerns about national security, says The Wall Street Journal. Read more: “We are required to follow the laws in the countries in which we operate, even if we disagree,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. Blocking Western apps in China is not new Several Western social networks are blocked in China; Even so, points out the WSJ, removing them from the App Store definitively closes a gap in the Great Firewall; This is because, once users were still able to download the applications, they were able to bypass Chinese barriers and use blocked networks through VPNs; In response to the deletion of its apps from the App Store, a Meta spokesperson declined to comment and said only that “we have forwarded it to Apple for comment.” These removals are further moves made by Apple with a view to adapting to the Chinese government's growing alleged censorship movement and tightening of laws related to data security. Apple was the biggest smartphone maker in China last year, with more than 17% market share, according to industry analyst International Data Corporation. Image: Rodrigo Mozelli (generated with AI)/Olhar Digital The Apple company has had to remove many more Chinese and foreign apps in recent months, following a government decree that requires developers to register their software with regulators by last month. According to Beijing, those that were not registered would be removed from app stores, under the prerogative of targeting apps considered insecure, such as those involved in telephone fraud. According to the WSJ, Apple even met with Chinese authorities to express concerns about how these rules would be implemented and how they would affect its users. In response, authorities in China told the company it must implement the rules strictly. The Chinese government has been increasingly repressing the space it owns on the internet, expanding censorship and control of data on the network, in addition to demanding that platform operators manage the online activities of their users. It is worth remembering, for example, that X, since when it was called Twitter, is banned there, with the Chinese forced to use the national version of the microblog, Weibo. In 2017, Apple was criticized for removing dozens of apps from the App Store that allowed Chinese users to bypass Great Firewall rules to access networks and apps blocked in China. In 2020, it took down thousands of iOS games after Chinese authorities cracked down on games without government licenses.",https://olhardigital.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/China-iphones-1-695x500.jpg,2024-04-19,-0.33,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Twitter', 'description': 'American social networking site', 'full_name': 'Twitter', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Capturadeteledacontadawikipedianotwitter.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'China', 'latitude': 35.0, 'longitude': 105.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meta', 'latitude': 57.93082809448242, 'longitude': 16.775279998779297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Street', 'latitude': 50.311378479003906, 'longitude': -3.630549907684326, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Western', 'latitude': 0.5, 'longitude': 34.58332824707031, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Beijing', 'latitude': 39.907501220703125, 'longitude': 116.39723205566406, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Weibo', 'latitude': 38.0252799987793, 'longitude': 115.1722183227539, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'iOS', 'latitude': 36.72077178955078, 'longitude': 25.330469131469727, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",Not directly related,"Apple removed WhatsApp and Threads from the Chinese App Store due to government orders citing national security concerns.

Reports are coming out showing that iPhone sales fell 10% year over year in 2024's first quarter. The setback was so stark, in fact, that Apple (AAPL -1.22%) lost the top spot in the world's smartphone market share race that it held just a quarter earlier! As is too often the case, though, such headlines fail to include a great deal of important context. Here's the rest of what you need to know about this week's news before deciding whether you need to dump your stake in Apple stock. The iPhone loses its top spot ... again The data comes from technology market research outfit IDC. In its most recent look at worldwide smartphone shipments, it reported that Apple delivered 50.1 million iPhones during the three months ending in March. That's 10 million fewer than the number Samsung (SSNL.F -28.74%) delivered in the same quarter. That's also a marked difference from the final quarter of last year when 80.5 million iPhones were shipped versus Samsung's count of 53 million. This market-share shift led Reuters to write a story with the headline ""Apple loses top phonemaker spot to Samsung as iPhone shipments drop."" Bloomberg's headline ""Apple faces worst iPhone slump since Covid as rivals rise"" is even more worrisome. To be fair, both headlines are technically accurate. However, there are a couple of relevant details worth expounding on. The first of these details is simply that this shift isn't abnormal. Apple is usually displaced as the global smartphone market leader between the fourth quarter and the following Q1. In fact, as the image below illustrates, in seven out of the past eight years Apple has lost its Q4 market share lead to Samsung during the following Q1. Why? The iPhone is a popular gift during the holiday shopping season. Samsung smartphones aren't. Samsung-made smartphones are, however, historically better sellers over the course of a full year. The other detail worth understanding is a semi-related one. That is, Apple started Q1 2024 at a disadvantage. People's response to the Q4 2023 release of the iPhone 15 was so strong that there weren't many interested buyers who didn't already own one by Q1. Also bear in mind that a handful of analysts -- including Morgan Stanley's -- suggest many iPhone fans may be holding out for the iPhone 16 that's likely to debut later this year. That's just a guess, of course, but not an unreasonable one given that a lot of actively used iPhones are now several years old. Indeed, the iPhone 11 -- released in 2019 -- is still the world's most used iPhone, according to a recent report from Scientiamobile. Since these devices are now nearly five years old, their owners won't be able to wait much longer to make the upgrade. Scientiamobile's data adds that the iPhone 12 and 13 are also now the second- and third-most used Apple smartphones. They're quickly approaching the end of their useful lives too. Not a reason to dump your Apple stock Don't read too much bullishness into these added details. Apple's still got some tough challenges ahead, to be sure. Just look at the bigger picture as an example. Even though Q4 iPhone sales were strong, the longer-term trend is a stagnant one. The company's not really shipping any more iPhones now than it was several years ago. iPhone revenue itself has been similarly stagnant since late 2020 as well, with the average selling price of the iPhone arguably reaching its peak. Given that about half of Apple's top line comes from sales of the iPhone, there's cause for concern. But the situation isn't quite as dire as this week's headlines would suggest. A subpar Apple is still a stronger company and a better investment prospect than plenty of other corporations on their best days. If nothing else, Apple is a cash-generating juggernaut. It can buy whatever growth it may no longer be able to create organically. That's the long way of saying Apple's Q1 smartphone stumble isn't nearly as big a deal as it's being made out to be in some of these headlines. There may be better options out there, but you could certainly do a lot worse than sticking with this one for a while longer.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F773103%2Fworried-investor-looking-at-computer.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630,2024-04-18,-0.035,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Morgan Stanley', 'description': 'U.S investment bank', 'full_name': 'Morgan Stanley', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Morgan-stanley-building.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Samsung', 'latitude': 36.39739990234375, 'longitude': 127.7323989868164, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reuters', 'latitude': 50.67449951171875, 'longitude': 9.351499557495117, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Don', 'latitude': 50.54912185668945, 'longitude': 2.9181699752807617, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Apple's iPhone sales declined 10% in Q1 2024, causing it to lose its top smartphone market share position to Samsung. However, this shift is not unusual, as Apple typically loses market share in Q1 due to the popularity of the iPhone as a holiday gift. Additionally, strong sales of the iPhone 15 in Q4 2023 may have contributed to the decline in Q1 sales, as many potential buyers may have already purchased the latest model. Despite these challenges, Apple remains a strong company with a significant cash flow, and its Q1 stumble is not as concerning as some headlines suggest."
Apple’s stock: a potential meltdown - Entrepreneur,Apple’s stock: a potential meltdown  Entrepreneur,"Fri, 19 Apr 2024 21:01:46 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9hcHBsZXMtc3RvY2stYS1wb3RlbnRpYWwtbWVsdGRvd24vNDcyOTk50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Entrepreneur,"Apple Inc., the world’s second-largest company, is teetering on the edge of a financial precipice. The company’s stock, long considered a bellwether in the market, is flashing warning signs of a significant meltdown. This article will deeply dive into the current state of Apple’s stock, the reasons behind its potential downfall, and the possible ripple effects on the broader market. On the edge of the 165 support line Apple’s stock is currently perched precariously on the 165 support line, a critical juncture in the stock market. The support line is a level where a stock’s price has historically not fallen below. It’s a point where the stock price tends to find support as it’s falling, meaning the price is more likely to “bounce” off this level rather than plummet below it. However, if the price does fall below the support line, it’s a clear signal of a bearish trend, which could trigger a significant drop in the stock’s value. A perfect double top The current situation of Apple’s stock is quite alarming, as it’s showing a perfect double top. A double top is a bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price twice, with a moderate decline between the two highs. It is confirmed once the asset’s price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs. The next line of support If Apple’s stock breaks the 165 support line, the next line of support is around 150. This means that if the stock price falls below 165, it could potentially tumble to 150 or even lower. This is a significant concern for investors, as a drop from 200 to 165 is already considered a bloodbath in the stock market. If the stock price falls to 150 or worse, it could trigger a massive financial crisis for the company. Why the potential meltdown? But why is Apple’s stock showing signs of a potential meltdown? One of the main culprits is the company’s negative revenue growth over the past year. Despite this, Apple’s stock still trades at a 30% premium valuation to the broad market. This raises the question of whether a company with negative revenue growth should trade at a premium valuation. Apple’s strategy to combat revenue issues Apple’s current strategy to combat its revenue issues is the introduction of $3,500 virtual reality goggles. However, it’s uncertain whether this product will be successful in boosting the company’s revenue. The tech industry has seen similar attempts in the past, such as Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, which didn’t significantly impact the company’s revenue. The potential impact on the broader market The potential downfall of Apple’s stock could significantly impact the broader market. As the second-largest company in the world, any major changes in Apple’s stock price could meaningfully move tech stocks and the broader market. Therefore, it’s crucial for investors and market watchers to keep a close eye on Apple’s stock developments. Conclusion In conclusion, Apple’s stock is currently on the verge of a major meltdown. The company’s negative revenue growth and the stock’s bearish trend are significant concerns for investors. If the stock breaks the 165 support line, it could potentially lead to a massive financial crisis for the company and significantly impact the broader market. Therefore, investors must understand the charts and monitor the developments closely. Stay tuned for daily financial updates, and let us know your thoughts on Apple’s current stock situation and its potential impact on the broader market. Frequently Asked Questions Q.

""I respectfully disagree"" with that viewpoint, said Adam Selipsky, Amazon's cloud chief, in an interview with AFP. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Meta have made headlines talking about their own foundational models, or those of their close partners, that are key to AI and its ability to produce written works, images, videos or even computer code from simple user prompts. But ""there is simply not going to be one model to rule them all,"" argued Selipsky. AWS, Amazon's industry-leading cloud branch, is already seeing customers ""needing multiple models for multiple different use cases,"" he explained. He cited the capabilities of various AI models available on the AWS Bedrock platform, such as Meta's Llama and Claude from Anthropic, as well as some from Mistral in France and Amazon's own Titan brand. Generative AI is regarded in Silicon Valley as poised to revolutionize the way people get jobs done. And cloud computing companies, which have massive computing power, troves of data and AI expertise, now host generative AI models. They are in a prime position to capitalize on the new technology -- but they have a lot to lose if they don't cough up the latest innovations. 25 years of AI A pioneer of e-commerce, Amazon also dominates the cloud. AWS had 31 percent of the cloud computing market at the end of 2023, according to Stocklytics. But rivals Microsoft and Google are gaining ground with their cloud businesses, with 24 percent and 11 percent market share respectively. Thanks to a $13 billion investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Microsoft is ""in the driver's seat"" of an ongoing cloud revolution, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Microsoft and Google compete with their in-house, AI-infused digital assistants to help with creating content -- emails, presentations, ads -- and applications (especially chatbots). AWS is less known to the public and its digital assistant Alexa is not yet as conversational as ChatGPT. But Amazon has been in the AI business for more than 25 years, said Selipsky. ""If you go back to personalization on the retail website in 1998 -- we called it personalization, but it was AI."" The Seattle firm has long had thousands of people working on the technology and has pivoted some of them to the new frontier of generative AI, Selipsky said. ""We've moved rapidly on new generations of our (AI) chips like Trainium, and building Amazon Bedrock, and getting it adopted quickly and coming out with exciting applications on top of the models, like Amazon Q"", an AI assistant, he said. Selipsky, who took command of AWS in 2021, replacing Andy Jassy, who stepped into the chief executive role vacated by founder Jeff Bezos, was confident Amazon would remain a leader in cloud computing. Clients eye AI programs As proof, he points to AWS customers and partners, including Nvidia. The high-profile chipmaker recently announced it is building a ""supercomputer"" on AWS using Nvidia's own high-performing processors, the ultra sophisticated and coveted GPUs. Most notably, Amazon has invested $4 billion in Anthropic, an OpenAI rival that is also backed by Google. The start-up will use AWS and its Trainium chips to build AI models and help ""improve our technology,"" said Selipsky, When asked about exciting aspects of generative AI, Selipsky cited examples of ramped up productivity for its clients. AWS user pharmaceutical giant Pfizer estimates that it will launch more powerful drugs faster, achieving as much as a billion dollars in annual savings due to AI, according to Selipsky. Airlines and other industries are already using generative AI to power chatbots that interact with customers. And while chatbots can make mistakes, companies reason that ""human beings don't give 100 percent accuracy either,"" Selipsky said. ""And in many cases, the models are actually outperforming the accuracy and the usefulness of live agents.""

This new model will be equipped with a smaller screen compared to the iPhone 15 Plus, which now impresses with a 6,7-inch display. Of course, Apple has yet to reveal the exact screen size of the iPhone 17 Plus, leaving plenty of speculation among tech fans and analysts. This decision seems to be a clear differentiation strategy between the Plus model and the Pro Max versions, starting right from the iPhone 17 range. So, gadget lovers can expect a sharper distinction between the two versions. On the other hand, the iPhone 16 range, expected to debut before the iPhone 17, seems to be betting on bigger screens. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to sport 6,3-inch and 6,9-inch displays, respectively, which is a modest but notable increase over the 6,1-inch and 6,7-inch models iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. As the iPhone 17 is still a year and a half away from launch, these details are subject to change. Still, fans and analysts alike are keeping their eyes peeled for every detail that could provide clues about Apple's innovation directions. The iPhone 17 Plus, with its new screen format, promises to be a major highlight in the evolution of smartphones. While it is premature to speculate too much about the final features of the iPhone 17 Plus, it is clear that Apple continues to innovate and surprise.

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak working in their garage. It has been 10 years since the iPhone was launched, 40 years since Apple was officially incorporated, and 41 years since the founding of the company itself. Needless to say, the company has changed dramatically since 1977, when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak moved out of the Jobs’ family garage to the company’s first official corporate address, 20863 Stevens Creek Blvd., (Building 3, Suite C) in Cupertino, California. The pair had begun shipping their first computer, a naked circuit board called Apple I. It had neither a keyboard nor a screen, and functioned more as part of a kit that computer hobbyists could build on, if they knew what they were doing. Most people don’t know that Apple still owns its first official office. Two early Apple employees, Bob Martinengo and Mark Johnson, spoke to Business Insider about what it was like working with the two Steves back in the days when nobody knew what Apple was. They passed on to us this collection of images from Apple’s early days. We’ve combined it with some other early Apple images from Business Insider’s archives. A handful of Steve Jobs’ old business cards went up for auction in 2015, and we’ve got images of those too. Finally, Apple employee No.8, Chris Espinosa, recently tweeted some imagery from his archive. Scroll down to look at the origins of the most important tech company on the planet.↓↓↓ Early Apple images are relatively rare. In the 1970s people did not use cameras on a daily basis. These images are remarkable because they show life at Apple before everyone realized the company was going to change the world. For them, it was just a paycheck. “It was obviously a heck of a lot of fun,” Martinengo says. (He now works at AMAC Accessibility, a company that makes products and services for disabled students.) Brennan, 22 at the time, had become Jobs’ girlfriend in high school when she was 17, a relationship he later trashed when she became pregnant. Jobs disavowed the child, Lisa, despite naming the Apple Lisa machine (in development in 1978) after her. Jobs only admitted Lisa was his daughter when she reached her teens. This 1978 image shows more of the Apple II team, including Steve Jobs. Johnson, like Martinengo, was employed to assemble the Apple II. “This photo (above) was taken on a Friday,” Johnson says. “We were waiting for UPS to pick up the 57 Apple II computers that were completed. The reason the photo was taken was because that was the first time that we tested, assembled and shipped 57 units in one work week. A big accomplishment back then for the team.” Note that in this photo, Jobs appears to be arguing with Mike Scott, the first president of the company, who had been brought in to keep a leash on Jobs. This was a typical event, Johnson says. Elmer Baum was an engineer. “He was a senior, responsible person they brought,” Johnson says. “He worked in production and engineering. He was a little bit grumpy, ‘you kids get off my lawn!’ kind of guy.” Baum’s nephew, Jesse Berger, tells us, “He had a wonderful sense of humor, especially about himself, and was amused to find himself working with all these computer whizzes … After having been a pioneer in early wireless communications, working on classified programs during and after WWII, he was tickled to be working again on cutting-edge endeavors.” Here’s an early set of Apple company files. This image comes from the collection held by Digibarn. Mike Markulla was the venture capitalist who provided Apple’s first proper funding and installed real management. He used to drive a Corvette Stingray. (Johnson, who was a teenager at the time, said he did get a ride in it once.) Markulla invested the first $250,000 of venture capital money into Apple. Here’s another shot of the crew on the Apple II team, with the product in the background on a set of racks. Kottke, another hardware technician, has since become something of an archivist of early Apple memorabilia. Conditions in the office were primitive. This floor plan (below) of the Stevens Creek office, drawn by Johnson, shows just how small the company was at the time. It was “a rather small office space,” Johnson says. “This one office included the lobby and office space without a dividing wall. When you turn to the right, you enter the manufacturing area. Incidentally, Apple occupied the adjacent office space to the right of suite C. A smaller office space where Bill Fernandez designed circuit board layouts.” In the Stevens Creek office, Jobs and Wozniak worked right next to each other. That would change when Apple — now with about 30 employees — moved to its second, slightly larger office on Bandley Drive, also in Cupertino. There, Jobs and Woz sat as far apart as possible. “In the short time I was there it went from a goofy startup to a full-blown production line,” Johnson says. It went from being a place that was a lot of fun to being more of a “workaday” corporate experience, he remembers. “My only insider credit was that my mom had this relationship with Steve, Steve liked my mom. This was before the summer I started working at Apple. He had an interview on TV in Oakland, and I got drafted to drive him in my VW bug. Steve, even at that point, he was a handful, an intense person.” Click on the second photo in this tweet to see more views of the interior of the Stevens Creek office. Here’s a copy of Apple’s first-ever letterhead, as saved by Johnson. The Apple II was the machine that really put Apple on the map: an integrated home computer with a keyboard and screen, that anybody could use. Other key players from that era include Andre Sousan, who is believed to have been Apple’s first European sales manager; Sue Cabannis, who was the office manager; Gary Martin, who worked in accounting; and Don Bruener, who was a hardware technician. On January 2, 2017, Chris Espinosa — employee No. 8, who still works at Apple — tweeted: “40 years ago tonight, Woz got the key to 20863 Stevens Creek Blvd., Suite B3-C, which we had leased for the first Apple office.” This is a photo of Jobs sitting in the Good Earth restaurant, which was near the Apple office at the time. “He called up me and @SquareNerd [Randy Wigginton, employee No.6] and invited us to come over. The room was mostly empty. Carpeting on the left side, linoleum on the right,” Espinosa tweeted: “Woz, of course, knew all about these phones but had never had a Centrex of his own to play with. So he invented a game for us.” “We’d each take a phone and start with it on-hook, then try to dial each others’ extension. You have to hang up to redial, leaving you open.” “If you got rung 5 times you were out. We played that game for an hour, then went to Bob’s Big Boy down the street.” “The next morning the Steelcase desks and bookcases and lab benches came in. Marketing and Admin on the carpet, Eng and Mfg on the linoleum.” “On day 1 it was just Woz, Jobs, Mike Markkula, Bill Fernandez, and Rod Holt, with me and Randy hanging around.” When the Apple II launched in the summer of 1977, it had color graphics. So Jobs changed the company’s logo to an Apple silhouette filled with a rainbow. Johnson says, “Steve Jobs commissioned a local shop to create an embroidered patch to commemorate the new corporate logo. These patches were handed to each of the employees by Steve. I have asked around via Facebook to the other early Apple employees and no one can remember them. If there is another patch that survived, I’d like to know. This might be quite a unique artifact of early Apple days.” Gene Carter, an early Apple manager who worked with Markkula, tells us, “The embroidered Apple logo was done by me. We were going to the computer show in Anaheim – as I recall – and wanted to distinguish the Apple people from the masses. My daughter was a flag girl at Saratoga High and had embroidered letter ‘S’s’ on their sweaters. I had the same company do the logo for us. Mike Markkula and I went to Macy’s and bought white sweaters for everyone to wear at the show and had the logo put on the breast of the sweater. That was in 1978.” Apple later moved to 20525 Mariani Avenue, Cupertino, as this old set of business cards shows. The cards were auctioned by The Marin School last year. They span the years 1984 to 1990. What is great about them is that they cover all of Jobs’ three jobs — at Apple, Next and Pixar. Apple still owns the Stevens Creek building. This is what the outside of it looks like today. You can see Espinosa’s Facebook Live tour of the building here. People’s memories have faded over time, of course.

"Canon might buy Apple, rumors say: Today in Apple history - Cult of Mac","Canon might buy Apple, rumors say: Today in Apple history  Cult of Mac","Sun, 21 Apr 2024 19:01:53 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1bHRvZm1hYy5jb20vNDc3NTUzL2FwcGxlLWhpc3RvcnktY2Fub24tYXBwbGUtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Cult of Mac,"April 21, 1995: Rumors swirl that Canon (yes, the Japanese camera company!) might take over Apple in either a partial or complete acquisition. Speculation grows about a possible deal after Apple reveals its latest earnings, which show big improvement but still fall far short of Wall Street’s expectations. Canon buying Apple?!? Although Canon denied interest, and neither Canon nor Apple ever publicly confirmed any such negotiations, the rumor mill in April 1995 buzzed about the possibilities. With AAPL shares trading at $35, Canon reportedly offered a not-insignificant $54.50 a share. That represented a total valuation of $6.5 billion for Apple. (To put that in perspective, today Apple is closer to a $2.6 trillion market cap.) Canon might seem like an unlikely candidate to buy Apple, but in fact the company was a pretty major tech player in the 1980s and ’90s. After Macintosh project founder Jef Raskin left Apple, Canon scooped him up and gave him the opportunity to develop his vision of the Macintosh. Released in 1987 as the Canon Cat, the computer failed to take off — despite critical acclaim and decent sales. Not long after, in June 1989, Canon paid $100 million for 16.67% of Steve Jobs’ post-Apple company, NeXT. Canon later provided another $10 million to $20 million in 1991, and extended a $55 million credit line in 1992. Canon also manufactured the NeXT Computer’s optical disc drive, and Jobs ultimately sold NeXT’s hardware business to Canon in 1993. (Apple acquired NeXT in 1996, bringing Jobs back to Cupertino in the process.) Apple acquisition rumors made sense Therefore, the idea that Canon might acquire Apple wasn’t totally unreasonable. The rumors came at a time when Apple CEO Mike Spindler was desperately trying to offload the company. Other potential (serious) purchasers included IBM and the now-defunct Sun Microsystems. Apple also approached Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Sony, Philips and Toshiba, although those discussions never went far. Ultimately, the Apple-Canon deal (obviously) never happened. In April 1995, Apple was enjoying a brief respite from the “bad old days” of the 1990s. Thanks to increased demand for Macs in the second quarter of 1995, Apple earned $73 million. That was more than four times the $17 million it made the same quarter a year earlier. Before too long, Spindler was out at Apple. New CEO Gil Amelio, who harbored a different strategy for turning the company around, replaced him. Then, by the end of 1996, Steve Jobs returned. Amelio got ousted, and Apple was primed for its comeback. Things could have been very, very different, though. Any longtime tech fans want to speculate on where a Canon-run Apple would be today?

Among the big (and numerous) announcements, Google showed us its Pixel Fold, the company’s first foldable phone, detailing its specifications, starting price and release date. A mobile with which Google wants to face Samsung, which currently dominates the market for portable devices, although the Korean company may have another important competitor. According to a series of rumors echoed by the website 9to5Mac, Apple is also working to launch several foldable devices in the future. Rumors gathered by the website detail that the Apple company would be internally developing several prototypes of foldable iPhones and iPads, although these would take quite a long time to be released to the market. Various industry analysts speak of 2025 as the earliest release date for these future Apple devices, of which not much more is known so far. Among the prototypes that Apple has created, there would be one that would resemble an iPhone that folds, similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, and another that would look more like an iPad that can be folded to become a phone. According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, this Apple tablet would be the first to hit the market. “I am optimistic about the 2024 foldable iPad and expect this new model to drive shipments and improve product mix,” Kuo said. My latest survey indicates that the foldable iPad will have a carbon fiber kickstand. The carbon fiber material will make the stand lighter and more durable.” In addition, according to CCS Insights, Apple’s first foldable device would cost around $2,500, a much higher price than current iPhones. The prices of foldable cell phones are currently around 1,800 euros, so we would be talking about the most expensive foldable cell phone on the market.

2024 - Democratic Republic of Congo | Government accuses Apple of using minerals from “illegally mined” mines - Actual News Magazine,2024 - Democratic Republic of Congo | Government accuses Apple of using minerals from “illegally mined” mines  Actual News Magazine,"Thu, 25 Apr 2024 04:41:41 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2FjdHVhbG5ld3NtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZW5nbGlzaC9kZW1vY3JhdGljLXJlcHVibGljLW9mLWNvbmdvLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtYWNjdXNlcy1hcHBsZS1vZi11c2luZy1taW5lcmFscy1mcm9tLWlsbGVnYWxseS1taW5lZC1taW5lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Actual News Magazine,"(Paris) The Congolese state accuses the Apple group of using “illegally exploited” minerals in its products which come “from Congolese mines” in which “many human rights are violated”, according to documents consulted by AFP . According to the lawyers mandated by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), these minerals would then be “transported out of the DRC and in particular to Rwanda, where they would be laundered”. “It appears from the file” submitted by the DRC “that the Apple company uses strategic minerals purchased in Rwanda in its products,” assert the lawyers mandated to draft a formal notice, a summons before the initiation of legal proceedings. “Rwanda is a central player in the illegal exploitation of minerals and in particular the exploitation of tin and tantalum in the DRC,” say the lawyers. “After their illegal extraction, these minerals are smuggled into Rwanda, where they are integrated into global supply chains,” states the formal notice. “These disputed minerals come largely from Congolese mines in which numerous human rights are violated,” continue the lawyers. This formal notice was sent this week to the two Apple subsidiaries in France by French lawyers William Bourdon and Vincent Brengarth. A letter was also sent to the American parent company of the technology giant, which notably markets the iPhone and Mac computers. The subsoil of the DRC is full of minerals, the country being the world’s leading producer of cobalt and the leading African producer of copper. According to a report by the NGO The Enough Project published in 2015, “these mineral sites often appear to be controlled by armed groups who force, through violence and terror, civilians to work there and transport these minerals. Children are also forced to work in these mines.” The Kinshasa government accuses Rwanda of wanting to take control of the resources, particularly mining, of eastern Congolese, one of the reasons why, according to it, Kigali supports the M23 rebellion, on the offensive for more than two years in the province of North Kivu. The M23 currently controls large parts of North Kivu and surrounds the provincial capital Goma. This formal notice from Apple is explained according to these lawyers “by the extraordinary seriousness of the situation in the east of the DRC and which is a source of very serious damage to the local population and to the Congolese state”. “Blood Ores” “The responsibility of Apple, and beyond that of large high-tech manufacturers, when they use blood minerals, has long remained a black box,” lawyers William Bourdon, lawyer at Paris office, and Robert Amsterdam, lawyer at the London bar. The lawyers consider “notoriously insufficient” the “various commitments and precautions taken” by Apple, “either on its own initiative or in application of the law with regard to the use of minerals purchased in Rwanda”. “The DRC intends to moralize the rare mineral extraction sector, especially when they are extracted at the cost of committing the most serious crimes and sometimes for the benefit of those who commit them,” they argue. “The Apple company seems to rely mainly on the vigilance of its suppliers and their commitment to respecting Apple’s code of conduct, as well as external audits carried out on the activity of these suppliers. However, both these suppliers and the auditing companies appear to rely on ITSCI certification, the serious and numerous malfunctions of which have been demonstrated,” states the formal notice. The Tin Supply Chain Initiative (ITSCI) program is one of the main mechanisms put in place more than 10 years ago to ensure a supply of “conflict-free” and responsibly mined minerals in the DRC, according to the British NGO Global Witness. In April 2022, this NGO accused this program of contributing in the DRC to the contrary in the laundering of minerals linked to conflicts, child labor, or resulting from trafficking and smuggling. To source tin, tantalum and tungsten (the so-called “3T” metals, widely used in electronic equipment), large companies such as Apple, Intel, Samsung, Nokia, Motorola, Tesla, rely on this “failing” mechanism. “, lamented the NGO, which revealed that “in a certain mining area” in eastern DRC, “90% of the minerals that entered the program during the first quarter of 2021 did not come from validated mines.” Apple’s formal notice from the DRC is accompanied by a list of questions on “3T minerals used in Apple products”. The lawyers put Apple on notice to respond “within three weeks”. “All legal options are now on the table,” the lawyers added. Contacted by AFP, Apple referred to elements published in its 2023 annual report on conflict minerals. This indicated that it had “found no reasonable basis to conclude that any of the 3TG (tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold) smelters or refineries determined to be part of our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or in a neighboring country.",https://actualnewsmagazine.com/english/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Democratic-Republic-of-Congo-Government-accuses-Apple-of-using.jpg,2024-04-25,0.037,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'William Bourdon', 'description': 'French lawyer', 'full_name': 'William Bourdon', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/William_Bourdon.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Motorola', 'description': 'former telecommunications company', 'full_name': 'Motorola', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/UWAMotorolaSoftwareCentre_gobeirne.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Paris', 'latitude': 48.85340881347656, 'longitude': 2.34879994392395, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 39.40283966064453, 'longitude': -82.70710754394531, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Democratic Republic of Congo', 'latitude': 0.0, 'longitude': 25.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Rwanda', 'latitude': -2.0, 'longitude': 30.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'France', 'latitude': 46.0, 'longitude': 2.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mac', 'latitude': 41.80757141113281, 'longitude': -76.58300018310547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NGO', 'latitude': 1.913290023803711, 'longitude': 10.529820442199707, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Kinshasa', 'latitude': -4.321420192718506, 'longitude': 15.308070182800293, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Kigali', 'latitude': -1.9499499797821045, 'longitude': 30.058849334716797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'North Kivu', 'latitude': -0.6551499962806702, 'longitude': 29.033979415893555, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Goma', 'latitude': -1.674090027809143, 'longitude': 29.228450775146484, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'London', 'latitude': 51.50852966308594, 'longitude': -0.12574000656604767, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Intel', 'latitude': 37.38793182373047, 'longitude': -121.96353912353516, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Samsung', 'latitude': 36.39739990234375, 'longitude': 127.7323989868164, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nokia', 'latitude': 61.447120666503906, 'longitude': 23.37717056274414, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"The Congolese state accuses Apple of using illegally exploited minerals from Congolese mines in its products, which are then laundered through Rwanda.

Apple Vision Pro: when will it arrive in France and the rest of the world ? - The Saxon,Apple Vision Pro: when will it arrive in France and the rest of the world ?

We therefore believe that the release date could be confirmed by its manufacturer before the Worldwide Developer Conference. However, a keynote is being organized on May 7, during which we should also be able to discover new Apple tablets. As WWDC will take place from June 10, we believe that next month's event is the ideal time for the Vision Pro deployment schedule to be revealed by Cupertino. The company had already launched the device in the United States last January (date of pre-orders). Tim Cook has also already confirmed that the Apple Vision Pro will be released in China in 2024. It is therefore a safe bet that the mixed reality headset will also see the light of day in the rest of the world, including in France, the same year. Several analysts assume this, starting with the very serious Ming-Chi Kuo, closely followed by investors who bet on AAPL stock on the Wall Street stock exchange. The Apple company is worth nearly three thousand billion dollars. Some researchers even believe that in the long term, the “mixed reality” of the company could weigh almost a sixth of this sum. But this is yet another subject, which we will not address here. Beware of stock shortages In the United States, the Vision Pro became available on February 2. But in reality, some had to wait much longer to obtain the virtual reality headset, even though pre-orders had opened about a dozen days earlier. And for good reason: The manufacturer would not have anticipated such success for its new product. As of the date of pre-orders, nearly 80,000 people have chosen to treat themselves to the device. Today, we are talking about nearly 200,000 orders already placed. Even before the launch was revealed for the European continent, however. This remarkable success therefore quickly exhausted the stocks that Apple had originally planned, the company not having estimated to sell as many Vision Pros. And we could be victims of a similar event in France and the rest of the world. Be careful, however, because recent estimates, also by Ming-Chi Kuo, assume that the frame would ultimately only be sold in approximately 400,000 units, in 2024. According to calculations made by Apple, this is half as much as expected, but these figures have not been confirmed by the company. Many apps from launch The Apple Vision Pro is launched with many apps that are also found on Mac. This is particularly the case for Pages, Keynote or Messages. The developer wants to make it a real tool intended to replace your workstation, for example when traveling. But you'll have to pay a price: count on nearly 4,000 euros for the expected price in Europe. The second major release of visionOS, the operating system for Apple Vision Pro, is expected to be released at the Worldwide Developer Conference. We do not yet know the new features that the publisher will present for the occasion, except that a possible Apple Pencil 3 could be compatible with the virtual reality headset .

After three months on the market, impressive use cases and also a few complaints that have arisen in scattered form, Apple has begun asking its users for feedback about their experience with the Vision Pro. To take advantage of first-hand data, the bitten apple company has sent surveys that ask about various aspects. Apple’s survey on the Vision Pro includes 16 questions focused on evaluating product satisfaction, environment usage, favorite features, what it is used for, how often it is used. Additionally, there are questions about guest mode and who else uses the Vision Pro, even though the device is not set up for sharing. Apple asks Vision Pro users for first-hand information Some specific questions about the Vision Pro experience include: What type of video content are you most interested in watching on ‌Apple Vision Pro‌? When you use your ‌Apple Vision Pro‌, how often are you immersed in an environment? Whenever you use apps on ‌Apple Vision Pro‌, how often do you multitask? Have you set your Persona to use on FaceTime? How satisfied are you with the look of your Persona in ‌Apple Vision Pro‌? Where is your ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ used most? Although the Apple Vision has only been on the market for a short time, this survey coincides with the most recent reports that interest in the device is fading, leading Apple to rethink its marketing strategy. According to a report by leaker Ming-Chi Kuo on his Medium blog, the company will reduce the number of shipments. Initial estimates suggested that Apple would produce between 700,000 and 800,000 units per year. Now Apple’s goal would be around 400,000 and 450,000 units. Resolving this situation is urgent. Apple must readjust its plans before the expansion of the Vision Pro planned for different months in 2024. In addition to current users, the reduction in demand for demonstrations in retail stores has also been discouraging. Despite the current situation, what seems like a disadvantage now is also Apple’s great advantage. The Vision Pro is a new product that must adjust several detailsespecially the demand for apps so that users really find a differential. Apple knows this and this survey suggests that it won’t wait too long to get to work.",https://ipadizate.com/hero/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-para-el-trabajo.jpg?width=1200,2024-04-29,0.037,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Persona', 'description': 'Japanese business', 'full_name': 'Persona'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Apple', 'latitude': 34.127601623535156, 'longitude': -95.4174575805664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pro', 'latitude': 15.960000038146973, 'longitude': 106.86315155029297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ming', 'latitude': 9.751399993896484, 'longitude': 30.139280319213867, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]",Not directly related,"Apple is surveying Vision Pro users to gather feedback on product satisfaction, usage, and favorite features.

Because iOS 18, its next operating system for mobile devices, promises to arrive loaded with artificial intelligence, but with what model? Taking into account that the possibility of Apple implementing its own AI model imminently is remote (at least, for now), the first rumors pointed to negotiations with Google that would imply the arrival of Gemini and its products to iPhone, but now Mark Gurman from Bloomberg echoes Of nails Apple talks with OpenAI, none other than the company behind the popular ChatGPT. OpenAI would come to the rescue of AI in iOS 18 But isn’t Apple with its own developments in artificial intelligence? Yes, in fact this week we learned of the existence of four new AI models made in Applewhich indicates that Cupertino has got its act together and that in the medium term it will be the bitten apple company itself that will put artificial intelligence in its devices, but in the meantime Apple will draw on strategic alliances. Thus, Mark Gurman details that Apple and the company led by Sam Altman are talking so that some of the new artificial intelligence functions of iOS 18 are vitaminized by OpenAI AI products. More specifically, Gurman says that the negotiations focus on the use of OpenAI technologies to drive a chatbot with AI in iOS 18 in the purest ChatGPT style. It’s unclear if this chatbot is intended to replace Siri or if Apple will introduce a new virtual assistant. There is nothing closed. At the beginning of the year, some anonymous sources already let it slip that Apple and OpenAI were talking about the issue, but the rumors are coming back strongly and carefully because this does not imply that Cupertino has made a decision: at the same time it seems that Apple is still arguing with Google about the possibility of using Gemini on iOS. Tim Cook’s company is likely looking for the best deal in terms of functionality – cost. And not only that: it is also said that Apple is negotiating with Baidu for users in China, since Google does not operate there. Be that as it may, iOS 18 and the new iPhone 16 will arrive with a lot of artificial intelligence and also top-notch. For the moment we will have to wait until June, Apple’s usual meeting with the devs at WWDC 2024 where the new generation of iOS and some of its main new features.

Berkshire&apos;s stake in Apple fell by 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31 from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023, even as the iPhone maker&apos;s share price fell just 11%. The conglomerate appears to have sold about 115 million shares, or 13% of its holdings in the quarter. The sale resulted in Berkshire realizing an $11.2 billion after-tax gain in the quarter from its sale of Apple stock and contributed to the rise in the company&apos;s cash holdings to a record of $189 billion. Despite Berkshire reducing its holdings in Apple, Buffett said he expects it to remain the company&apos;s largest stock investment. ""We have sold shares and I would say that at the end of the year I would think it extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have,"" Buffett said. He went on to explain how he and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, viewed their stock investments in companies like Apple. BUFFETT RETAKES THE STAGE AS BERKSHIRE PREPARES TO PASS THE BATON ""One interesting thing is that Charlie and I looked at common stocks or marketable equities or the things that people love to look at as being businesses, and so when we own a Dairy Queen, or we own whatever it may be, we look at it as a business. When we own Coca-Cola or American Express or Apple, we look at that as a business,"" Buffett explained. ""Now, we can buy really wonderful companies in the market as businesses — we can&apos;t buy all of their shares, we can&apos;t buy 90% or 80% or anything like that,"" he added. Buffett went on to say those companies and Apple are ""wonderful"" businesses and that Berkshire&apos;s assessment of those firms is such that they&apos;ll remain major holdings unless something dramatic occurs. WARREN BUFFETT PAYS TRIBUTE TO FRIEND, CHARLIE MUNGER AS &apos;ARCHITECT&apos; OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ""We will own — unless something really extraordinary happens — we will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,"" Buffett said. Later in the question-and-answer session, Buffett cited Apple CEO Tim Cook&apos;s leadership as a reason for his confidence in the tech giant and said he has been a great successor to the late Steve Jobs. Buffett also touched on the tax consequences of selling Apple stock at this time when the capital gains tax rate is lower than it has been historically and said that it may be higher again in the future as the government looks to narrow the budget deficit. He also said that given alternatives in the market and uncertainty around the world, holding a larger cash stake is preferable. WARREN BUFFET BLASTS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ANNUAL LETTER ""I don&apos;t mind at all under current conditions building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternative of what&apos;s available in the equity markets and I look at the composition of what&apos;s going on in the world, we find it quite attractive,"" Buffett said. ""Almost everybody I know pays a lot more attention to not paying taxes than I think they should. We don&apos;t mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we&apos;re taking in Apple and that rate was 35% not too long ago, and it&apos;s been 52% in the past when I&apos;ve been operating,"" Buffett said. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE ""It doesn&apos;t bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope that with all that America has done for all of you, it shouldn&apos;t bother you that we do it and if I&apos;m doing it at 21%, and we&apos;re doing it at a lot higher percentage later on, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll actually mind that we sold a little Apple this year,"" he explained.

Tech companies break earnings records despite regulatory battle - EL PAÍS USA,Tech companies break earnings records despite regulatory battle  EL PAÍS USA,"Sun, 05 May 2024 03:15:42 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5lbHBhaXMuY29tL2Vjb25vbXktYW5kLWJ1c2luZXNzLzIwMjQtMDUtMDUvdGVjaC1jb21wYW5pZXMtYnJlYWstZWFybmluZ3MtcmVjb3Jkcy1kZXNwaXRlLXJlZ3VsYXRvcnktYmF0dGxlLmh0bWzSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vZWNvbm9teS1hbmQtYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyNC0wNS0wNS90ZWNoLWNvbXBhbmllcy1icmVhay1lYXJuaW5ncy1yZWNvcmRzLWRlc3BpdGUtcmVndWxhdG9yeS1iYXR0bGUuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,EL PAÍS USA,"The dominance of tech companies is growing despite regulatory pressure. Authorities in the United States and Europe have launched an offensive to end monopolistic practices that they consider illegal. But meanwhile, the digital giants are growing larger and larger as bankable entities, nourished by the new golden goose of artificial intelligence. Profits at Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta shot up 38% in the first quarter to $92.037 billion. The five big tech companies have been joined by Nvidia, which operates on an irregular fiscal calendar and will present its February-April earnings report on May 22 and is also expected to evidence record-breaking sales and profits. Those six companies add up to a stock market value of $13 billion and have reached all-time trading highs, backed by their performance. Apple enjoys a vast market share in high-end smartphones; Google is without rivals as a search engine and in online advertising; Amazon dominates e-commerce; Microsoft, operating systems; Meta has an enviable position within social media with Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp; while Nvidia holds a new monopoly in high-powered processors. Each one is sucking the juice out of its respective market, and continues to add new divisions. Another similarity is that all six firms are working with artificial intelligence, which requires high levels of investment to maintain market position. Microsoft leads the pack, thanks to its alliance with OpenAI. Not just its cloud computing business has benefited — it is also incorporating levels of artificial intelligence to its products. Alphabet, which was caught off-guard by generative artificial intelligence, is making up the ground it lost at a rapid pace in its server business. Amazon was a pioneer in identifying cloud data and computing as big business, but it is also taking advantage of artificial intelligence among its commercial offerings, inventory management and even route optimization. Meta has seized on AI to better hook users on its social platforms and to improve its ad management. Apple is a wildcard, having fallen behind in generative artificial intelligence, but it does incorporate certain functions and apps in its products and services that feed off of AI. Nvidia, which counts the other firms as clients, has been the greatest beneficiary of the new technology’s gold rush. The only firm that did not break records in the first quarter was Apple. A drop in iPhone sales and supply chain delay in Chain has hobbled sales, which fell 4% to $90.753 billion, and profits, which dropped 2% to $23.636 billion. The company is facing regulatory pressure related to its app store and a lawsuit over illegal monopolistic practices in the United States smartphone market. The Department of Justice has accused the company of protecting the iPhone’s dominant position by closing off its technological ecosystem to competitors. Tim Cook’s Alphabet has become a profit leader at $23.662 billion, 57% higher thanks to a 15.4% growth in sales stemming from improvements in marketing and server growth. The company headed by Sundar Pichai has received multimillion-dollar sanctions from the European Union and faces two lawsuits from the U.S. Department of Justice. One, regarding the search engine market, is set to be ruled on next Friday in Washington D.C. Another, related to digital advertising, is working its way through the courts. For its part, Amazon leads in sales, with a $143.313 billion growth that equals a potent 12.5% increase. Its profits have tripled to $10.431 billion. E-commerce business accounts for the bulk of CEO Andy Jassy’s company, but cloud computing and advertising business (on its commercial platform and streaming service) have also become primary motors for its growth. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), directed by Lina Khan, has accused Amazon of monopolistic practices that “inflate prices, degrade quality, stifle innovation for consumers and businesses.” Sales and profits at Microsoft grew more than expected, driven by business demand for its cloud and AI services. Profits at the company led by Satya Nadella rose 17% to $61.858 billion in the first quarter of the calendar year, equal to a third of its fiscal year. Net income was $21.939 billion, an increase of 20%. After overcoming obstacles to its purchase of Activision, its alliance with OpenAI is now under the scrutiny of both the Department of Justice and the FTC. The only poor showing on the market came from Meta, but not due to numbers, per se. Sales at the company that was founded and is run by Mark Zuckerberg shot up in the first quarter by 27% to $36.455 billion. Still, after its 2023 austerity exercise, it spooked the market by raising its spending and investment estimates based on AI. Its second quarter forecast was also disappointing. Aside from its lawsuits over the impact of social media on minors, the FTC sued Meta in 2021, accusing it of reducing competition with its purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, and that process is still underway. The FTC wants that to go to court this year. For now, neither fines, nor lawsuits, nor investigations, nor regulatory change have been able to slow the unstoppable growth of the tech giants, which have become digital age monopolies thanks to the innovation and global success of their goods and services. They’re all competing for their slice of the AI pie.
