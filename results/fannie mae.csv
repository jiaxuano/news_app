CIPs are typically smaller pools of loans that are geographically focused and marketed to encourage participation by non-profit organizations, minority- and women-owned businesses (MWOBs), and smaller investors. The one large pool includes approximately 1,205 deeply delinquent loans totaling $221.9 million in unpaid principal balance (UPB), and the CIP includes approximately 52 deeply delinquent loans totaling $14.5 million in UPB. The CIP consists of loans geographically located in the New York area. All pools are available for purchase by qualified bidders. This sale of non-performing loans is being marketed in collaboration with BofA Securities, Inc. and First Financial Network, Inc., a woman-owned and -controlled business, as advisors. Bids are due on the one large pool by May 2, 2024, and on the CIP by May 16, 2024. Terms of Fannie Mae's non-performing loan transactions require the buyer of the non-performing loans to offer loss mitigation options designed to be sustainable for borrowers. All buyers of non-performing loans are required to honor any approved or in-process loss mitigation efforts at the time of closing, including forbearance arrangements and loan modifications. In addition, non-performing loan buyers must offer delinquent borrowers a waterfall of loss mitigation options, including loan modifications, which may include principal forgiveness, prior to initiating foreclosure on any loan, not secured by property which is vacant or condemned at the time of closing. In the event a foreclosure cannot be prevented, the owner of the loan must market the property to owner-occupants and non-profits before offering it to investors, similar to Fannie Mae's FirstLook® program. Interested bidders are invited to register for future announcements, training and other information here. Fannie Mae will also post information about specific pools available for purchase on that page.

Fannie Mae: Prohibited/subjective language in appraisal reports has declined - HousingWire,Fannie Mae: Prohibited/subjective language in appraisal reports has declined  HousingWire,"Tue, 09 Apr 2024 20:30:31 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9mYW5uaWUtbWFlLXByb2hpYml0ZWQtc3ViamVjdGl2ZS1sYW5ndWFnZS1pbi1hcHByYWlzYWwtcmVwb3J0cy1oYXMtZGVjbGluZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"Fannie Mae this month issued a recent progress report on its ongoing effort to scan appraisal reports for “prohibited or subjective language,” updating stakeholders on a process that began in 2021 to rid appraisal reports and valuation decisions of verbiage that could be construed as contributing to appraisal bias. In February, Fannie Mae issued a Selling Guide update describing unacceptable appraising practices, offering that prohibited language includes the “development of a valuation conclusion based […] on the sex, race, color, religion, disability, national origin, familial status, or including a reference to any protected class[…].” The same update described “subjective language” as the “use of unsupported assumptions, interjections of personal opinion, or perceptions.” A stated goal of the policy is to “help lenders and appraisers stay safe as it concerns their obligation to comply with fair lending laws and with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice,” according to the update. Fannie Mae went on to call the implementation of the policy a “success story” based on its data. Beginning in 2021, Fannie Mae began scanning appraisal reports it received for instances of prohibited or subjective language as described in its Selling Guide updates, saying that letters were sent to “more than 1,500 appraisers” to alert them of violations, similar to instances of potential bias found by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) that year. “About 79% of the appraisers who received a letter in 2021 had no new findings in 2022,” Fannie Mae said. “In 2023, the fraction with no new findings increased to 93%. Similarly, 91% of appraisers who received a letter in 2022 had no new findings in 2023.” The overall occurrence rate for these violations has gone down, Fannie Mae said. In 2021, the occurrence rate stood at 0.15% and by 2023 it had declined to 0.03%, according to Fannie Mae data. “These statistics highlight the remarkable progress appraisers have made in becoming more objective in their thinking and writing, and in eliminating consideration of protected class,” the GSE said in the update. These efforts were also expanded last year to include “language that may infer consideration of protected class along with additional cases of subjectivity or unsupported assumptions,” which led to the issuing of more than 1,900 additional letters. Unlike the aforementioned letters, however, they were only educational in nature and were not issued to inform appraisers of violations. “[T]he feedback received [from these letters] has been mostly positive,” Fannie Mae said. “We congratulate appraisers for adopting new ways of thinking and writing to eliminate unsupported assumptions and consideration of protected class, and we look forward to even more progress in the future.”",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AdobeStock_579896042_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg,2024-04-09,-0.303,[],"Fannie Mae reports progress in its effort to eliminate biased language in appraisal reports.

Fannie Mae: Consumers Adjust to Higher Rates - | Florida Realtors,Fannie Mae: Consumers Adjust to Higher Rates  | Florida Realtors,"Tue, 09 Apr 2024 12:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsb3JpZGFyZWFsdG9ycy5vcmcvbmV3cy1tZWRpYS9uZXdzLWFydGljbGVzLzIwMjQvMDQvZmFubmllLW1hZS1jb25zdW1lcnMtYWRqdXN0LWhpZ2hlci1yYXRlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,| Florida Realtors,"WASHINGTON – While a growing number of consumers think mortgage rates will increase in the coming year, their optimism about the home buying and selling market ticked up, according to Fannie Mae’s Home Purchase Sentiment Index (HPSI). The HPSI decreased 0.9 points in March to 71.9, its first decline since November 2023, primarily due to increased pessimism about mortgage rates. Fannie Mae said 34% of consumers believe mortgage rates will go up over the next 12 months – up from 32% last month. Twenty-nine percent believe rates will go down. At the same time, consumer perceptions of buying and selling conditions ticked up slightly again in March. Both measures have now risen multiple months in a row. However, only 21% of those surveyed believe that it’s a good time to buy, underscoring the continued concern about the lack of affordable housing. The full index is up 10.6 points year over year. “The HPSI remained relatively flat in March, but we're seeing signs that consumers may be adjusting their expectations for the housing market to better accommodate the higher mortgage rate and home price environment,” said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae senior vice president and chief economist. ""Both our 'good time to buy' and 'good time to sell' measures continued their slow upward drift this month. However, consumers took a slightly more pessimistic view on the likely direction of mortgage rates, likely reflecting the fact that actual mortgage rates have moved upward since the start of the year,” he said. “With the historically low rates of the pandemic era now firmly behind us, some households appear to be moving past the hurdle of last year's sharp jump in rates, an adjustment that we think could help further thaw the housing market. We noted in our latest monthly forecast that we expect to see a gradual increase in home listings and sales transactions in the coming year. We believe this will be driven not only by those coming off the sidelines due to a rate-related recalibration, but also by households who may need to move for other life reasons,” he said. Home Purchase Sentiment Index component highlights Good/bad time to buy: The percentage of respondents who say it is a good time to buy a home increased from 19% to 21%, while the percentage who say it is a bad time to buy decreased from 81% to 79%. As a result, the net share of those who say it is a good time to buy increased 4 percentage points month over month. Good/bad time to sell: The percentage of respondents who say it is a good time to sell a home increased from 65% to 66%, while the percentage who say it's a bad time to sell decreased from 35% to 34%. As a result, the net share of those who say it is a good time to sell increased 2 percentage points month over month. Home price expectations: The percentage of respondents who say home prices will go up in the next 12 months decreased from 42% to 40%, while the percentage who say home prices will go down decreased from 23% to 20%. The share who thinks home prices will stay the same increased from 34% to 38%. As a result, the net share of those who say home prices will go up in the next 12 months increased 1 percentage point month over month. Mortgage rate expectations: The percentage of respondents who say mortgage rates will go down in the next 12 months decreased from 35% to 29%, while the percentage who expect mortgage rates to go up increased from 32% to 34%. The share who thinks mortgage rates will stay the same increased from 32% to 36%. As a result, the net share of those who say mortgage rates will go down over the next 12 months decreased 8 percentage points month over month. Job loss concern: The percentage of respondents who say they are not concerned about losing their job in the next 12 months decreased from 78% to 77%, while the percentage who say they are concerned increased from 22% to 23%. As a result, the net share of those who say they are not concerned about losing their job decreased 2 percentage points month over month. Household income: The percentage of respondents who say their household income is significantly higher than it was 12 months ago remained unchanged at 19%, while the percentage who say their household income is significantly lower increased from 11% to 12%. The percentage who say their household income is about the same decreased from 70% to 68%. As a result, the net share of those who say their household income is significantly higher than it was 12 months ago decreased 2 percentage points month over month. The HPSI distills information about consumers' home purchase sentiment from Fannie Mae's National Housing Survey (NHS) into a single number. The HPSI reflects consumers' current views and forward-looking expectations of housing market conditions and complements existing data sources to inform housing-related analysis and decision making. The HPSI is constructed from answers to six NHS questions that solicit consumers' evaluations of housing market conditions and address topics that are related to their home purchase decisions. The questions ask consumers whether they think that it is a good or bad time to buy or to sell a house, what direction they expect home prices and mortgage interest rates to move, how concerned they are about losing their jobs, and whether their incomes are higher than they were a year earlier. The National Housing Survey (NHS) is a monthly attitudinal survey, launched in 2010, which polls the adult general population of the United States to assess their attitudes toward owning and renting a home, purchase and rental prices, household finances and overall confidence in the economy. Each respondent is asked more than 100 questions, making the NHS one of the most detailed attitudinal longitudinal surveys of its kind, to track attitudinal shifts, six of which are used to construct the HPSI (findings are compared with the same survey conducted monthly beginning June 2010).

Fannie Mae Revises Mortgage Rate Predictions for 2024 - National Association of REALTORS®,Fannie Mae Revises Mortgage Rate Predictions for 2024  National Association of REALTORS®,"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hci5yZWFsdG9yL21hZ2F6aW5lL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLW5ld3MvZmFubmllLW1hZS1yZXZpc2VzLW1vcnRnYWdlLXJhdGUtcHJlZGljdGlvbnMtZm9yLTIwMjTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,National Association of REALTORS®,"Mortgage rates moved higher this week, with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage reaching a 6.87% average, Freddie Mac reports. Some economists are revising their rate predictions, looking for them to be higher this year than previously thought. Fannie Mae was among them, this week saying it expected the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to end 2024 at 6.4%, up from its 5.9% prediction earlier this year. Economists say strong job numbers and hotter-than-expected inflation data are leading financial markets to forecast a less aggressive rate-cutting path by the Federal Reserve. The Fed this week kept its benchmark interest rate steady but continued to suggest that three rate cuts are coming. Nevertheless, Fannie Mae economists are predicting existing-home sales to trend upward this year. Its Home Purchase Sentiment Index recently showed 65% of homeowners say now is a “good time to sell,” a rising percentage. “The housing market is likely to continue to face the dual affordability constraints of high home prices and elevated interest rates in 2024,” says Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae’s chief economist. “Still, while we don’t expect a dramatic surge in the supply of homes for sale, we do anticipate an increase in the level of market transactions relative to 2023—even if mortgage rates remain elevated.” The National Association of REALTORS® reported Thursday that home sales in February were on the rise leading into the spring buying season. Existing-home sales jumped 10% in February, NAR reported. Though recent rate jumps could make some prospective home buyers jittery, not all are so sensitive to the week-to-week changes, says Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “The number of cash buyers has increased. In many markets, these cash buyers are not investors but regular home buyers who have accrued significant equity in an existing home that they can roll over into the purchase of a new home.” Indeed, NAR’s latest housing report showed one-third of existing-home sales in February were cash deals. Given higher mortgage rates, Sturtevant predicts repeat buyers will make up a bigger share of the housing market in the months ahead. “First-time buyers will unfortunately have more buyers who they have to compete with as mortgage rates remain elevated,” she says. “The good news is that there should be more inventory coming into the market this spring.” Freddie Mac reports the national averages for mortgage rates for the week ending March 21: 30-year fixed-rate mortgages: averaged 6.87%, up from last week’s 6.74% average. Last year at this time, 30-year rates averaged 6.42%. 15-year fixed-rate mortgages: averaged 6.21%, rising from last week’s 6.16% average. A year ago, 15-year rates averaged 5.68%.",https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/gettyimages-878419256.jpg,2024-04-09,-0.034,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Doug Duncan', 'description': 'American politician', 'full_name': 'Doug Duncan', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Duncan_greets_supporters%2C_September_2013.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NAR', 'latitude': 57.25727844238281, 'longitude': 18.625089645385742, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bright', 'latitude': 39.21839141845703, 'longitude': -84.8560562133789, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sturtevant', 'latitude': 42.69807052612305, 'longitude': -87.89452362060547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae revised its 30-year fixed-rate mortgage prediction to 6.4% for 2024, up from 5.9% earlier.

That's according to Fannie Mae's Home Purchase Sentiment Index, which dipped to 71.9 in March, its first decline since November. Potential home buyers have been feeling put off by mortgage rates that have seesawed near 7% for most of the year. However, data from the survey showed consumers have begun to set their expectations around the higher rates, said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae senior vice president and chief economist. The measurements for “good time to buy” and “good time to sell” in the housing market both moved higher—although nearly 80% said now was a bad time to buy a house. “With the historically low rates of the pandemic era now firmly behind us, some households appear to be moving past the hurdle of last year’s sharp jump in rates, an adjustment that we think could help further thaw the housing market,” Duncan said. The government-sponsored enterprise also forecast a gradual increase in home listings and sales this year with those adjustments by potential homebuyers in mind. Mortgage rates have moved down from the highs of 2023, when they nearly reached 8%. Since dropping below 7% last year, mortgage rates have mostly moved sideways, hovering in the same range since December. Homeowners have been reluctant to give up the low mortgage rates they got during the pandemic and sell their properties, creating a “lock-in” effect that has chilled the housing market. The survey also showed more than two-thirds of consumers think mortgage rates will go up or stay about the same over the next 12 months, with fewer responding they believed rates would fall.

There is, however, growing pessimism toward mortgage rates: Thirty-four percent of consumers believe mortgage rates will go up over the next 12 months, up from 32% in February, while only 29% of say they believe rates will decline. Despite the jump in pessimism toward rates, consumer perceptions of both homebuying and home-selling conditions ticked up slightly in March.

With the historically low rates of the pandemic era now firmly behind us, some households appear to be moving past the hurdle of last year’s sharp jump in rates, an adjustment that we think could help further thaw the housing market. “We noted in our latest monthly forecast that we expect to see a gradual increase in home listings and sales transactions in the coming year,” Duncan says. “We believe this will be driven not only by those coming off the sidelines due to a rate-related recalibration, but also by households who may need to move for other life reasons.” Photo: Grahame Jenkins",https://mortgageorb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Affordability.jpg,2024-04-09,-0.301,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Doug Duncan', 'description': 'American politician', 'full_name': 'Doug Duncan', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Duncan_greets_supporters%2C_September_2013.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Photo', 'description': 'French photography magazine', 'full_name': 'Photo'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Duncan', 'latitude': 38.28812026977539, 'longitude': -85.92497253417969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae's Home Purchase Sentiment Index shows a slight increase in consumer optimism about homebuying, with 21% believing it's a good time to buy.

Transcript Alan Murray: Leadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte who, like me, are exploring the changing rules of business leadership and how CEOs are navigating this change. Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I’m Alan Murray. Michal Lev-Ram: And I’m Michal Lev-Ram. So today’s guest was Priscilla Almodovar. She’s the CEO of Fannie Mae and she is the only Latina CEO of a Fortune 500 company. We recorded this episode on International Women’s Day, by the way, so it felt very fitting. Murray: Yeah, I was fascinated, Michal. You don’t know this part of my life, but for the decade that I ran the Washington [D.C.] bureau of the Wall Street Journal, Fannie Mae was a very big presence in my life because they almost ran Washington. They were a huge powerhouse with a massive lobbying machine. And whenever you suggested that anything was amiss with the business model, they would come down on you like a ton of bricks. All of that, of course, changed with the Great Recession, and Fannie Mae went into conservatorship and turned into a very different organization, which she now heads. So I was very interested to hear about the new Fannie Mae. Lev-Ram: Yeah, clearly some changes over the last, especially going back to the last 15 years or so, and it was it was a great conversation. One of the things that struck me, by the way, which I guess has not changed, is that there are a lot of for all the power that Fannie Mae once had and for the very large role it still plays in the housing market, a lot of Americans don’t really know what this company does and how it’s structured, which, as you said, is pretty unique. Murray: Which they should, because in most cases they benefit from it. If you’re buying a kind of a normal-sized house, it creates the market that enables you to get the price that you get. So we talk about all of that in this episode. I really enjoyed it. The other thing that people need to understand is Fannie Mae is number 28 on the Fortune 500 list. We’re talking about a really large company. Lev-Ram: Yeah, absolutely. By the way, I tried to get her to tell us where I should and could buy a home. She didn’t really deliver on that, but she had a lot of other fascinating things to say, including just about her own life experience, her background, and sort of how that positioned her to lead this company today and to, you know, try and fulfill on their mission. So, without further ado, here is our conversation with Priscilla. Welcome, Priscilla. It’s been a little over a year since you became CEO of Fannie Mae. And I think our first question is just how is it going? Priscilla Almodovar: Thank you. Thank you for having me. It’s been going great. A year in and I’m hitting my stride. It’s a great, great place to be. Lev-Ram: Any surprises along the way? Almodovar: Yeah. Look, you know what has surprised me the most has been a pleasant surprise. Fannie Mae is a great company. I’m surprised how many Americans don’t know what Fannie Mae does. It’s been around for 85 years. We provide liquidity to the housing system, make sure it works for Americans, and a lot of consumers don’t know that. And today it’s critically important. We hold one in four mortgages, $4.3 trillion in assets. And, you know, we’re making housing possible for everyone. Murray: I’d like to dig in on that a little bit. It is a massive company, it’s like number 28 on the Fortune 500 list. But it’s an unusual company, right? You were chartered by the government during the Great Depression. You’re still, these days since the Great Recession 15 years ago, you’ve been operating under conservatorship. I guess the question I’ve always had is, I understand in the Great Depression why we needed Fannie Mae. There was a crisis. But today we have the deepest financial markets in the world. Why do we need a government-chartered enterprise to be part of that? Almodovar: Yeah, well, look, taking a step back. We do have a unique business model. So we’re not in the primary mortgage market. We buy mortgages from lenders. We securitize them and sell them to investors and mortgage-backed securities. As part of that, our business model is we manage a lot of risk. We you know, we guarantee the mortgages. So we take credit risk. We take operational risk. We take capital markets risk, cyber risk. So the pipes, making sure the markets function and work. We bring liquidity to the market. And you know, a great example of the role that we play, and we can’t underestimate how important it is to have high functioning liquid housing markets. We’re the only place in the world where you have a 30-year fixed rate mortgage product. And a great, I think, Exhibit A of why it’s so important to have a Fannie Mae is what happened during the pandemic. You know that story has not been told: 1.5 million households kept their home during the really hard time because of our loss mitigation programs. And we kept the mortgage markets going. Today, 99% of those have been resolved. Murray: And we would yeah, we… Almodovar: That couldn’t have kind of happened. Murray: Private banks wouldn’t have done. Almodovar: Exactly. And it was because we were there. Our business model is high functioning. It’s safe and sound. We had the liquidity, and we were able to do that. Murray: The other concern in the past, of course, has been that, as you said, you manage risk, but the fear that that risk ends up back on the taxpayer, that it becomes public risk. How do you deal with that? Almodovar: Yeah, well, look, today the mortgage market in the U.S. is completely different from 15 years ago. So we’re looking ahead today. The loan rules that did not exist before today, loan quality is very different today. So when we talk about the housing market per se, it’s very sound from a credit risk perspective. When I look at our FICO scores, when I look at loan-to-value, debt-to-income ratios, it has never been this safe. So the rules of the road for mortgage finance in the U.S. are very different. As a country, we learned our lesson from 15 years ago and you have regulation. I mean, I just think of Fannie Mae, the company we are today, our business model, we have a capital rule. We do stress testing. We have a very strong regulator in the Federal Housing Finance Agency. This didn’t exist before. Murray: And I think I’m right that at the end of the day, it also didn’t cost the taxpayers anything. Almodovar: Thank you for that. Not only did it not cost the taxpayer anything. So I think we drew 119 billion from Treasury. We have paid back 181 billion. So, it’s been a great investment for the taxpayer. It’s been a great deal for the taxpayer. And in the last few years, we’ve been built building capital through retained earnings. Today, Fannie Mae, this was as of December of 2023, 78 billion in capital. We’re still undercapitalized, but we’re building capital. We see how as a business, it’s an operating model that is very well-run and very well risk managed. Lev-Ram: So can I just go back real quick? And I know, Alan, we want to get into the outlook for 2024. But before we do that, you know, you mentioned being surprised by how there’s still a little bit of a discrepancy and sort of the impact and the role that Fannie Mae plays versus the awareness of Americans, and I’m surprised by that. I mean, going back to the housing crisis 15 years ago, what you were describing that took place during COVID, the fact that there is still kind of this gap in awareness, how much of an issue is that for you? Because, of course, one of the things we’re going to get to is your passion and your mission to make the housing market more equitable, more accessible to all. So talk more about the awareness gap, I guess. Almodovar: Yeah, look, part of the issue as a, if you will, we’re a B2B company, so we don’t deal directly with the consumer. So right there, the consumer directly does not know us. We deal with our lenders and they deal with the consumer. So that by definition is always an issue. But most consumers don’t understand that the lender who probably originated that mortgage is not the one who continues to own that mortgage. It’s probably not the one who’s servicing the mortgage. I think what we’re trying to do is build that awareness through our home education programs. More and more, we are filling that void for the consumer and leaning into our mission and our charter. I mean, our duty to serve is to make the housing system more fair, more equitable, and I think the consumers are starting to become aware that something is changing. So, for example, when I think about our strategy today, first of all, number one job is liquidity in the market. And the pandemic is just a great example of why that is so important. But our two strategic objectives are how do we make the housing system more fair and more sustainable? And we look at everyone from renters to homebuyers to homeowners, and it’s about sustainable whatever you might have, a renter or a homeowner. And we’re making it more fair by using technology. So, for example, before, if you were a renter in this country, your rent did not count. Today, through technology, Fannie Mae is taking that credit risk and if the consumer shows us through their bank statements, we can tell what probably is a rent payment, the regularity of that payment, and we could make that consumer eligible. Murray: That’s huge. Almodovar: It’s huge. Murray: You can qualify people instead of a credit score, qualify them on a renter’s score. Almodovar: That that did not exist two years ago. And it’s something Fannie Mae led the charge. We started with renters. We went to our landlord partners and said, we’re willing to pay for it because we want to the test the concept. And today, I’m happy to say over 500,000 rentals units are reporting their rent payments. On the homeownership side, we have qualified 5,000 now homeowners that did not have FICO scores. Those that didn’t have a FICO score have one today. And those that did have seen an increase of like 38 points. That’s quite meaningful. So, you know, one thing we’ve learned is that housing payment is a housing payment, whether it’s a rental payment or principal and interest payment, and we’re making that count. So it’s those types of innovations that I’m hopeful, job number one for a CEO is to make sure your stories told and people understand that, and I’m very committed to doing that. I mean, our employees come to work every single day very proud for what they do for the country. And it’s meaningful. It’s super meaningful. I mean, housing, as you all know, is probably the number one asset for most people and it’s foundational to life’s outcomes. Murray: You wrote a great piece for Fortune, appreciate you doing that, called “A Tale of Two Markets,” that we have a problem in the real estate market right now and it’s working very differently for different people. Can you explain that? Almodovar: Yeah, yeah. It’s funny how quickly the housing market is changing, but that was probably in the Fall or middle of last year. The “tale of two markets” meaning if you’re a home owner today, you’re probably in a very good place. You’re housing, you’re happy. You probably have a mortgage with a 3% or 4% handle. Murray: I do. Almodovar: Exactly. You’ve seen house appreciation. I mean, home prices during the pandemic went up like 20%. And last year, home prices were up 7%. This year, we’re expecting home prices to continue going up, not at that same trajectory, maybe more than 3 to 4%. So you’re feeling really good. And that’s what we call the lock-in effect. You’re not moving if you’re not a homeowner, and if you want to be a homeowner, it’s hard because affordability. Mortgage rates are higher. They have come down. In October of last year, mortgage rates hit that 8% number, and psychologically, that’s a big difference from 3%, both psychologically and also your pocketbook. It’s a lot more. So rates have come down, but mortgages are still expensive, and home prices are still high because there’s no supply. So that’s where we have limited tools for supply. We’re on the financing side. But supply, ultimately, is one of the key issues and why it’s a tale of two markets. If you’re a homeowner, you’re feeling really good. If you want to be a homeowner. Or even renters. I mean, today, if you look at our population, let’s say we have 124 million households, a third of them are renters. Those renters, more than 50% are cost burdened. By that we mean they’re spending more than 30% of their income on rent. It’s just affordability is a key issue. And that’s where it’s a tale of two markets. Lev-Ram: So, Priscilla, I’m going to jump in here and ask a question for a friend. Where should first time buyers be looking? Are there hotspots that are kind of under the radar? And, you know, I’m sitting here in the Bay Area, so this is not the place. But what are you seeing across the country? Almodovar: Look, I would say my advice to any for anyone who wants to be a homeowner, first time homeowners, by the way, the millennials are driving that demand. When you look at where that demand is coming from, it’s the millennials and, by the way, right behind them, the older Gen Zs are right behind as well. So the first thing I would say is fix your credit. I think one of the things Fannie Mae is doing is really understanding what are the obstacles for first-time homeowners and surprisingly, having a thin credit or no credit is an obstacle. And that’s why these positive rent payments is a key. So if you’re a renter, see if your landlord will report your positive rent. So get that all fixed, I think is job number one. Education is a big part, just generally what it means to be a homeowner. You know, today, if you ask consumers what makes a good life, they usually list owning a home as along with good health, a good job. But you have to understand what it means to be a homeowner, to really understand the cost. You know, throughout the, I would say throughout the country, home prices have gone up. Obviously, there are pockets where they’ve gone up higher, but it’s throughout the country, I would say. But there’s a lot you can do in the meantime. Just getting smart about what it is to be a homeowner and save and it’ll happen. The American dream is still very much alive. It might just take a little longer. Lev-Ram: Do you see, though, a little bit of a I guess, a psychological shift with the younger generations, with millennials and Gen Z? I mean, I feel like I’ve seen some articles and studies out there that not only are people buying homes later in life, which make sense just given the economy and the housing market, but that there’s also like a little bit of a shift in perception of needing to be a homeowner? Do you look at that? Almodovar: Look, rent or homeowner to us, we’re agnostic as we were about having someone having a stable, affordable home they can live in. I would say yes, it’s the first time, you know, 35 years old. But I would say the millennials still want to be homeowners. When we do our surveys, having a home is still very much something that millennials are driving. In fact, we do a monthly home purchase sentiment where we try to see how people are feeling, both sellers and future homeowners. And February was the third consecutive month where sellers, by the way, are saying this might be a good time to sell. That’s good news for the sort of spring buying selling season. But purchasers are also saying while they’re pessimistic that they can buy a home, i’s the first time we’re seeing them saying, you know what? Mortgage rates are probably going to come down. Maybe this is the time I should start looking at a home. So I do think the millennials are still driving that demand. If they want to be a homeowner, it’s still being driven by millennials. Murray: I’m surprised to hear you say you’re agnostic between buying and renting. I mean, I think there used to be a rhetoric that came out of Fannie Mae traditionally that owning a home was kind of a civic virtue, that the goal was to increase the percentage of people who actually owned a home because all sorts of other good things kind of responsibility went along with that. You don’t feel that? Almodovar: So first of all, the world is very different from, I don’t know, the past, again, I’m living in the future of Fannie Mae. Murray: Yeah, I’m a guy of the past. I’m an old guy. Almodovar: Okay. So, I’m in the future. So that’s number one. Number two, a third of households are renters. And I grew up as a renter, so my bias is that being a renter is fine. Now, did my parents dream to have a home? Was that home what changed the trajectory of our life? Absolutely. And today, owning a home is still the number one way where families build generational wealth. And if we’re honest about it, there is still a stubbornly huge gap between white households and nonwhite households and Black households, there’s still this 30% plus or minus gap… Murray: Wealth gap. Almodovar: Well, there’s a homeownership gap. Murray: Which is also a wealth gap. Almodovar: There’s also a wealth gap. Right. Exactly. And then Latinos, the homeownership gap is about 20%. Latinos, interestingly, are the one cohort they’re having improvements in homeownership. And I think we can talk about that. That partly could be culturally as well. For Latinos, owning a home is something that’s becoming, there was an article recently that it’s becoming a family affair. I mean, they will pool their resources, they will buy that home. So I think if that was a bias before, I think it’s still the number one way to build wealth in this country. It’s still, as I said, when you ask people what’s a good life, they do mention homeownership. I do believe millennials still want to be homeowners and raise a family. But it is not the only way. The same way we have to change the perception of what Fannie Mae is and what we do is being a renter, if you have a stable, affordable home, you have roots in your community as well. So that’s my orientation. Look, today, Fannie Mae, we support, we’re 20% of the rental financing market. Murray: Is that right? Almodovar: Yeah, 20, we finance 20% of rental units in the country and in single family we’re about 25% of the entire single family. So we’re the full spectrum and it’s important for Fannie Mae to think about the entire journey of the consumer from renter and renters who want to become a home buyer. And once they’re a home buyer, homeowner, and that’s how we view our work. [Music starts.] Murray: Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte U.S., is the sponsor of this podcast and joins me today. Welcome, Jason. Jason Girzadas: Thank you, Alan. It’s great to be here. Murray: I have a sense, Jason, from conversations on Leadership Next and elsewhere, that business leaders today better understand the benefits of having a diverse set of voices at the management table. But what are some of the lessons you’ve learned through Deloitte’s own DEI journey? Girzadas: Lots of lessons learned I think. We’ve certainly made progress. We feel like that’s a function of a couple of things. Deloitte is very proud to have published twice a transparency report that sets forward long-term expectations for the diversity of our workforce and how we hold ourselves accountable. That is meant to be, and I think has served to be a role model stance for us to take and one that we encourage all businesses to replicate. The second is to get specific. In addition to transparency, the specific objectives around gender diversity, around Black and Hispanic Latinx, as well as other cohorts that we have really established not only a recruitment and retention, but also advancement goals for. And finally, adding to the mix, how we intend to hold ourselves accountable for supplier diversity as well as longer-term ambitions for us in this space. So our experience is somewhat emblematic of what a lot of large organizations go through. But for us, the commitment and transparency as well as the specificity around cohorts has made a difference. And we’ve seen positive results in the last two years that we’re hoping to build upon. Do we declare success? Absolutely not. But it’s made all the difference for us. Murray: Jason, thanks for your perspective and thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next. Girzadas: Thank you. [Music ends.] Lev-Ram: Priscilla, you brought this up and I want to dig a little bit deeper, but one of the things we wanted to talk to you about is you and you are the only Latina CEO on the Fortune 500. So, tell us more about your background and how it informs your leadership today at Fannie Mae. Almodovar: Yeah, look, I’m the only but I’m so I’m so optimistic it won’t be for long because, again, the Latino cohort is real and women also. But the Latino cohort is having a lot of gains educationally and otherwise. So as I mentioned, I grew up in Brooklyn. My family there, I’m Puerto Rican. My parents came to the mainland in the 1950s. Like many Puerto Rican, the Puerto Rican diaspora for a better life. And I grew up in a very optimistic household and at my kitchen table, I heard, like probably many American families do today, talked about a good job. Education was like, you know, that’s what neither of my parents at the time had gone to college. So an education and saving for a home. And I still remember when I was five years old, they bought their first home. I still remember the first night I slept in my room. And I think that’s informed a lot of what I do. And I’ve considered myself very lucky. I’ve had a 30 year plus career in finance and about 20 years ago discovered this, what’s a unique part of finance is housing finance. And I’ve been able to build a career. I’ve had, this will be my fifth role in housing. Each of them I had worked with Fannie Mae. So the one great thing about joining this company, I came in with great admiration for the company for what they do, and I’ve just been very fortunate with each one to have a larger platform to influence more national policy issues. Murray: When did it first occur to you, having grown up the way you described? When did it first occur to you that you could be CEO of one of the 30 largest companies in the country? Almodovar: You know, I guess I never thought of “I’m going to be a CEO,” if I’m honest. I always, even from a young age, thought I would be leading something. I didn’t know what. Yes. I mean, I tell you, I tell this funny story, I it’s a bit embarrassing, but at six years old, I had an attache case as much as my book bag. So I think that says it all. And I think it comes really from my parents. I mean, my mom is now deceased. She thought she could do anything. I mean, it was just like this very this can do. And I just think I have inherited that, that I could figure it out. Murray: You must have had moments along the way coming up through Wall Street finance where you were sitting in a room surrounded by a bunch of guys and where you said to yourself, this system is never going to allow me to get to the top. Almodovar: That’s not true. Murray: You never felt it. Almodovar: You know, it’s the kind of thing where, again, look, in the 1990s there were very few women in finance, in law, in banking, and I never saw that as a as an obstacle. You know, if anything, I was in the room. I worked so darn hard. I wasn’t really trying to figure out the man woman thing. I just did my job and did it well and did project finance for the first ten years. And then I went to J.P. Morgan. I went to a state housing finance agency for three years, then went to J.P. Morgan, had an incredible career there. Were there times when I was the only woman in the room? Absolutely. But I still did my work really well and I think if anything, one of the great things of my position now at my age, you know, I could help change how people think. The face of leadership is changing, and I am just so excited to be part of that. So I look different. But I’m a leader and I really believe, back to your question about me as a leader. I think there’s leaders amongst all of us. So one of my leadership styles and at Fannie Mae, this was a little bit surprising, the first few months, but now the company has embraced it. I talk to the entire organization because as a leader, you want to hear what everyone I mean, we all contribute to the work we do. And it’s probably because I believe there’s a leader amongst all of us. So I never let that get in the way, Alan, being one of the few women. Lev-Ram: Who are some of the other leaders you’ve worked with and for along the way, you know, male or female, that have really you think, you know, helped kind of paved the way or made a big impact on you? Almodovar: Yeah, look, I’ve been very fortunate to work with many leaders that I’ve admired. You know, the one I will just say. But Jamie Dimon is probably the best banker that we, I will see in my generation. And this is not me dropping names. I will say he’s someone who genuinely cares about his leaders. Back to your woman question. Jamie doesn’t care if you’re a woman or a man. He just wants a job done and he treats everyone the same. He taught me to be a risk manager. One thing about working at a J.P. Morgan is you don’t realize you’re becoming a risk manager, but he’s very obsessed about end-to-end management, doing the right thing. So that that orientation, I think seeing that leadership and bank that so well run has been quite inspiring. I think back when I first started there were very few women where I was and there was one particular woman who’s now deceased who just like inspired me, like she was like this beautiful, [hard to hear] just this beautiful woman, patrician, and just took me under her wing. And so there were many. Murray: That’s great. You know, we have a lot of conversations on this podcast about the purpose of business. Yeah. And it gets into debates over, you know, Milton Friedman famously said 50 years ago, the social responsibility is to make a profit for shareholders. We’ve had Jamie Dimon actually led at the Business Roundtable, this whole notion of stakeholder capitalism, redefinition of the purpose of the corporation. You’re in an interesting place because you do have a social mission in your charter. You have shareholders, but you have a clear social mission in your charter. How do you think about that debate? Do you think your model is a better model? That it needs to be infused in other companies? Where where are you on the great stakeholder capitalism debate? Almodovar: Yeah, no, it’s a great question. You know, at Fannie Mae, as you say, it’s in our charter. So we have to balance mission and safety and soundness and a big part of our business model today is we need to get to that investable return. So return and running the company well is really important. It’s the only way we’re going to build capital right now. What I think is incredible is to me, the innovation at a Fannie Mae happens at the intersection of mission and safety and soundness and profitability, and it’s that tension where we probably do the best work. And, you know, I’m a believer, again, at Fannie Mae, it’s a lot easier because it’s what we do. That our workforce needs to look like the future homeowners. I mean, if I look at who the future homeowners are in this country, there’s a study out there that says by 2040, 90% of homeowners will be people of color. Well, our workforce should look like that, who we partner with, the suppliers we work with. So it’s very much of who we are to us is just how we run our business. To do it well, we have to understand our future homeowner, and that’s what we’re doing. Murray: Mission and performance. Almodovar: Mission and performance go hand in hand. You know, serving, I mean, this is true of I think many companies is, you have many stakeholders. You have shareholders for sure. But you’re a citizen of the communities where you work, you’re a citizen to your employees. So I think companies, well-run companies, and I think today most companies, I think, would say they really have to look at the full picture. And by the way, shareholders also expect that—they want good corporate citizens. Murray: Most of them. Almodovar: Yes. Murray: Your shareholders, maybe. Almodovar: Yes. Yes. No, I think it’s true of you know, I think, look, return is important. And by the way, there’s nothing wrong with that either. Right? So, you know, we are a capitalist society. And I think you can do good and make money at the same time, and the two do not have to be inconsistent. Lev-Ram: So on that note, I wanted to also bring up the fact we recently had the State of the Union address and housing came up, right? This is a big focus. And while we’ve got plenty of bright spots in the economy, the housing market consistently has been really tough for a lot of people. Again, first time buyers and current homeowners as well because of mortgage rates. As you look out to 2024 and given certain new incentives now that are coming into the fray, like what do you see happening? I mean, is there going to be an easing up here and if so, when? And just what can you tell us about looking out into the future? Almodovar: Yeah, look, our economists would say that 2024, the economy is still growing at a slower rate. You know, inflation in is coming down. The labor market is still strong. Even the news today, I mean, jobs and there’s still noise in the data, but still strong. We do think that mortgage rates will come down more, settle more in the sixes, low sixes, maybe high fives by 2025. So we do see mortgage rates coming down. So home sales, we expect this year home sales will go up. Last year, home sales were the lowest they’ve been in 30 years. So there’s some good news in the housing market we’re seeing. I mentioned the sentiment that sellers are saying, hmm, maybe this is a good time to sell. We’re seeing new home construction. So we as a country have not built housing at the rate that of new household formation. So new homes are coming online, new built homes. So supply is coming. That helps hopefully will help prices. We think prices will continue to go up, but not at the same pace. So there is some good news. And more and more, one thing that makes me optimistic is, as I mentioned, I used to run a state housing finance agency, I’m finding more mayors and governors are talking about housing because ultimately there’s an issue of supply. We need more supply of housing, you know, depending on which number you look at. Some people say we need 2 million more units of housing. Some people say we need 7 million. The point is we need a lot more housing and supply is ultimately a local issue. It’s a zoning issue. It’s a regulatory building code issue. And the fact that more folks are talking about that makes me optimistic. Murray: How is AI going to change Fannie Mae? Almodovar: Yeah, look, so so Fannie Mae has been using artificial intelligence and machine learning for a long time. Like we were the first ones to come up with a loan origination system that’s machine learning, that looks at how it would give an answer. So we’re looking at it very closely. So it’s helping us in our underwriting. So I mentioned rent as being, that’s that’s AI that’s doing that. What’s really exciting to me today is the consumer is changing and the economy. So think of the gig economy. So can we use machine learning and AI to look at bank statements differently to allow non-salary W2 income to count? Right. That would be one example. We’re using AI to understand our climate risk better. Right. Can we, from an informational perspective? Data understanding climate risk is another area. Collateral quality appraisal biases. So we’re using AI to help us look at appraisals differently. How appraisers judge a home and take out biases there. So there are many uses. We are very committed to taking a slower path and doing, you know, we have a governance model, an ethical framework to make sure that we’re doing it transparently. If we use a model that we could explain how it made decisions. We look at privacy and equity. We’re very excited about it. And obviously one that doesn’t get a lot of hype, but I’m excited about is how we run the company. Think about fraud detection. You know, how do I know when I get a W-2, it’s not a fraudulent W-2. So a big part of AI for a financial institution like a Fannie Mae is fraud detection. Think of cyber. Think of all the anomalies. So looking at anomalies from a fraud perspective, from a cyber perspective. So there are many use cases. And that’s what we’re exploring now because there’s a lot of opportunities. So I’m very excited. One of the books I just read was The Worlds I See by Dr. Fei-Fei Lee. Murray: Oh cool. Almodovar: It’s very well done. And it’s good for all of us to understand, like, what is AI? What’s machine learning and how do we bring—her big takeaway is how do we bring a human-centered approach to all this work? So really, it’s a book I recommend, and I know it had an impact on me. Murray: Fascinating conversation. Priscilla, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us. I hope we’ll see you at Fortune‘s Most Powerful Women event in California. You belong there. Almodovar: Looking forward to it. Yeah. Thank you. Lev-Ram: Thank you. Thank you, Priscilla.

Thirty-four percent of consumers now believe that mortgage rates will go up over the next 12 months, up from 32 percent last month and more than the 29 percent who believe rates will decline. Despite the jump in pessimism toward rates, consumer perceptions of both homebuying and home-selling conditions ticked up slightly again in March, and both measures have now risen multiple months in a row. Overall, though, the lack of housing affordability continues to weigh on consumers' belief that it's a ""good time to buy"" a home, with only 21 percent agreeing with that particular sentiment. The full index is up 10.6 points year over year. ""The HPSI remained relatively flat in March, but we're seeing signs that consumers may be adjusting their expectations for the housing market to better accommodate the higher mortgage rate and home price environment,"" said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. ""Both our 'good time to buy' and 'good time to sell' measures continued their slow upward drift this month. However, consumers took a slightly more pessimistic view on the likely direction of mortgage rates, likely reflecting the fact that actual mortgage rates have moved upward since the start of the year. With the historically low rates of the pandemic era now firmly behind us, some households appear to be moving past the hurdle of last year's sharp jump in rates, an adjustment that we think could help further thaw the housing market. We noted in our latest monthly forecast that we expect to see a gradual increase in home listings and sales transactions in the coming year. We believe this will be driven not only by those coming off the sidelines due to a rate-related recalibration, but also by households who may need to need to move for other life reasons.""

About Fannie Mae's Home Purchase Sentiment IndexThe Home Purchase Sentiment Index® (HPSI) distills information about consumers' home purchase sentiment from Fannie Mae's National Housing Survey® (NHS) into a single number. The HPSI reflects consumers' current views and forward-looking expectations of housing market conditions and complements existing data sources to inform housing-related analysis and decision making. The HPSI is constructed from answers to six NHS questions that solicit consumers' evaluations of housing market conditions and address topics that are related to their home purchase decisions. The questions ask consumers whether they think that it is a good or bad time to buy or to sell a house, what direction they expect home prices and mortgage interest rates to move, how concerned they are about losing their jobs, and whether their incomes are higher than they were a year earlier. About Fannie Mae's National Housing SurveyThe National Housing Survey (NHS) is a monthly attitudinal survey, launched in 2010, which polls the adult general population of the United States to assess their attitudes toward owning and renting a home, purchase and rental prices, household finances, and overall confidence in the economy. Each respondent is asked more than 100 questions, making the NHS one of the most detailed attitudinal longitudinal surveys of its kind, to track attitudinal shifts, six of which are used to construct the HPSI (findings are compared with the same survey conducted monthly beginning June 2010). For more information, please see the Technical Notes. Fannie Mae conducts this survey and shares monthly and quarterly results so that we may help industry partners and market participants target our collective efforts to support the housing market. The March 2024 National Housing Survey was conducted between March 1, 2024 and March 19, 2024. Most of the data collection occurred during the first two weeks of this period. The latest NHS was conducted exclusively through AmeriSpeak®, NORC at the University of Chicago's probability-based panel, on behalf of PSB Insights and in coordination with Fannie Mae. Calculations are made using unrounded and weighted respondent level data to help ensure precision in NHS results from wave to wave. As a result, minor differences in calculated data (summarized results, net calculations, etc.) of up to 1 percentage point may occur due to rounding.

Net revisions to the prior two months showed 167,000 fewer jobs added than previously reported, including a downward revision of 124,000 in January that reversed much of the previous upward surprise. The household employment report showed a net loss of 184,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate moved up two-tenths to 3.9 percent, its highest level since January 2022. While monthly volatility is expected in the smaller household employment survey, the divergence between it and the establishment survey has been persistent over several months and is not accounted for by definitional differences in the two surveys; in fact, when adjusting the definition of the household survey to match that of the establishment survey, household employment looks even weaker since November. We think the true strength of the labor market is somewhere in between the still-relatively robust establishment survey and the near-recessionary job declines in the household survey. This is consistent with a slowing economy. Data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) indices and the National Federation of Independent Business’s (NFIB) survey of small businesses, as well as measures of aggregate hours worked, suggest labor demand is likely softening. However, we do not see widespread evidence of job cuts. Layoffs and discharges from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) remain near historically low levels, and both initial and continuing unemployment claims are roughly at the same level as in early November when the household employment survey began deteriorating. As such, our forecast continues to call for slower job growth and a gradual upward drift in the unemployment rate, but for our base case forecast we do not expect outright job declines. Core Inflation Beats Expectations, but Disinflation is in the Pipeline Headline Consumer Price Index (CPI), which was released following the conclusion of our forecast, rose 0.4 percent over the month in February, pushing the year-over-year comparison up one-tenth to 3.2 percent. While part of the strength was due to a 3.8 percent jump in volatile gasoline prices, the larger story was the beat on core inflation, which also rose 0.4 percent over the month and was up 3.8 percent compared to a year earlier. Still, the underlying details were a bit more encouraging than the topline figure. The 0.5 percent increase in used auto prices is likely more noise than signal after a 3.4 percent drop the month prior, and we continue to expect deflation in core goods to resume in future months as used autos auction data continues to show price contraction. Furthermore, the 3.6 percent rise in airline fares is related to a similar-sized increase in oil prices. Owners’ equivalent rent (OER) slowed to a 0.4 percent month-over-month gain after a surprising 0.6 percent increase in January. We continue to see disinflationary forces related to shelter in the pipeline, as 2.0 percentage points of the 3.2 percent year-over-year gain in the CPI was due to lagged shelter data and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) own measure of new tenant rent was sharply negative in Q4 of last year. Over time, this should translate into lower measures of CPI shelter costs. Still, we believe this CPI report is unlikely to provide the “greater confidence” the Fed and Chair Powell are looking for to begin cutting interest rates. For now, we continue to expect the first rate cut to occur in June. If inflation data continue to surprise to the upside in coming months, however, the Fed may not begin cutting until later in 2024. In our view, whether the Fed begins cutting interest rates in June or later in the year is likely to have only a small impact on the macroeconomy and mortgage rates. In contrast, we believe the market’s expectations of the cumulative change in the fed funds rate over the next two to three years will likely have a more meaningful impact on mortgage rates. At the beginning of 2024, futures markets were pricing in about 150 basis points of cuts for 2024, but as of this writing futures suggest only about 75 basis points. If inflation prints continue to come in hot (even if they can be explained away by oddities) and payroll employment growth remains as strong as the last report (even if other labor market metrics show weaker conditions), then we suspect the odds of comparative large Fed easing will continue to diminish. We think the Fed is likely to be more cautious if the hard data are not conclusively pointing to a slowing pace of employment gains and inflation given the risk of a resurgence in inflation if they move too early. One thing we, and the market, expect at the March Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is some discussion of the policy regarding their balance sheet. The Chair noted at the last press conference that it would be a topic of discussion at the March meeting. Existing Home Sales Likely to Pull Back but Trend Upward Over 2024 as Listings Rise We have revised downward our outlook for home sales this month largely due to the higher interest rate outlook. However, we still expect an upward path in sales over the year even if there are some bumps along the way. Mortgage rates rising off their end-of-2023 lows has led to a slowdown in home purchase activity. While existing sales rose 3.1 percent in January to an annualized pace of 4.0 million, these increases reflected mortgage rates in November and December. Pending sales, which lead closings on average by a month or two, fell in January by 4.9 percent, pointing to a likely pullback in February. We have modestly revised downward our view of existing home sales in the near term based on this data; however, we continue to expect a generally upward trend in sales as the year unfolds. We believe an increasing number of transactions will be driven by households who can no longer put off their moves simply due to interest rate lock-in effects because they need to move for life event reasons. Notably, new sales listings for existing homes have continued to rise in recent months even as pending home sales pulled back. According to Realtor.com, the flow of new listings in February was up 11.3 percent from a year prior. This also aligns with the Fannie Mae Home Purchase Sentiment Index® (HPSI), which has showed comparative strength over the past two months, with the ""good time to sell"" component acting as one of the main drivers. We are expecting existing sales to drift upward to a pace of near 4.40 million annualized units by the end of 2024 (compared to the 4.00 million shown in the January release from the National Association of REALTORS®), even though we are anticipating the February sales pace to pull back. While we do not explicitly forecast new home listings, a future rise in listings is also expected to outpace the growth in sales, leading to a gradual loosening of the currently very tight housing market. An increase in the months' supply of homes for sales should also lead to some deceleration in home price growth over the next several years, even if a general lack of supply keeps home price appreciation positive despite affordability measures being stretched.",https://yourhome.fanniemae.com/sites/g/files/koqyhd251/files/2022-12/fm-logo.png,2024-03-15,-0.27,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Institute', 'latitude': 35.35765838623047, 'longitude': -77.71385955810547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ISM', 'latitude': 41.57693862915039, 'longitude': 19.56583023071289, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'OER', 'latitude': -5.86667013168335, 'longitude': 132.51666259765625, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bureau', 'latitude': 41.28919982910156, 'longitude': -89.3664779663086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Powell', 'latitude': 36.0317497253418, 'longitude': -84.02796936035156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Committee', 'latitude': 33.616668701171875, 'longitude': 73.0666732788086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Index®', 'latitude': 37.8980598449707, 'longitude': -83.28500366210938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not-related content.

A 2023 recession appeared to be developing. However, as the year progressed, consumer spending remained resilient and acute banking stress subsided while home prices rebounded. Continued economic resilience has surprised many forecasters this year and led to financial markets backpedaling multiple times on the pricing of impending Federal Reserve “pivots,” ultimately helping drive a rise in longer-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, to a 23-year high by October. Since that peak, however, longer-term interest rates have fallen sharply recently on yet another anticipation of rate cuts and slowing inflation in 2024. Fundamentally, our long-held view that the economy would enter a recession as monetary policy tightening worked to fight inflation was based on historical business-cycle dynamics that suggested inflation was unlikely to be brought back to the Fed’s 2-percent target without a significant weakening in the labor market. While some supply chain drivers of inflation were expected to subside over time, there was evidence that services inflation associated with a tight labor market had gone beyond what was consistent with an overall 2-percent inflation target. Historically, this has only been reduced via a substantial rise in the unemployment rate. To date, however, cooling inflation and wage growth is occurring while unemployment remains low. Compared to a year ago, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index rose 3.0 percent in October while core prices were up 3.5 percent, down from cycle-peaks of 7.1 and 5.6 percent, respectively. While core inflation in particular remains elevated on an annual basis, much of this is due to ongoing high measures of shelter inflation which lag more timely market measures of rent by 4 to 5 quarters. Currently, measures of rent growth for new tenants show slowing or even negative rent growth. As such, it is only time before this is reflected in the PCE. And inflation less shelter, whether measured by the PCE or the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is already closer to the Fed’s target than the overall measures. The question of whether inflation could be brought down without a meaningful rise in the unemployment rate appears to have been answered in the affirmative. However, we are not yet ready to declare that the window for a recession has passed. The labor market has cooled from extremely tight conditions in 2022 to a healthy level that broadly mimics its state in 2019. In November, the economy added 199,000 jobs, an increase from October, but this was inflated by the ending of the United Auto Workers (UAW) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) strikes. Removing the effects of the strikes from both reports would indicate job gains slowed from roughly 180,000 in October to 150,000 in November. If this pace of employment growth can be maintained, then it would be consistent with a soft landing. However, the current monetary policy stance is still restrictive, and past tightening is still working its way through the economy. Bank lending is slow, near-term indicators suggest business investment is currently sluggish, and consumer spending is still in excess of its historical relationship to incomes. Whether it results in a recession or not, we believe growth is likely to decelerate significantly over the coming 2-3 quarters. Given the current restrictive stance, to achieve a soft landing, monetary policy will need to ease sufficiently this next year to prevent a downturn, but not reanimate inflation – a difficult balance to achieve. An uptick in average hourly earnings in November illustrates the risk that the labor market could still overheat and contribute to future inflationary pressures if monetary policy is eased prematurely. As such, we are projecting the start of fed funds rate cuts in Q2 2024, but at a cautious pace. 2023 Home Sales Will Be Lowest Since 2010, With Slow Recovery Beginning in 2024 We entered the year forecasting existing home sales to be around 4 million, a pace below most other forecasters and the lowest since 2010. While our forecast oscillated over the year along volatile mortgage rates, and our view on economic growth evolved, the sales expectation held in a narrow range. The drivers of slow sales are well known at this point: unaffordability, lock-in effects, and a lack of existing inventories freezing much of the housing market. While we believe these dynamics will slowly dissipate over time, they will remain obstacles in 2024. We forecast year total 2024 home sales to only be marginally higher than in 2023. With that said, the extreme low point in October, where existing sales dropped to an annualized pace of 3.79 million, is likely to be at or near the low point. While October pending sales point to November sales also being low, purchase mortgage applications, as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association, have bounced about 15 percent off their trough in November, as mortgage rates have fallen considerably. Given an expectation of further moderation in mortgage rates, we expect sales to start drifting upward. While the difference between a soft landing and a recession would have an effect on purchase demand, given current supply constraints, we see the path of future mortgage rates as being more determinative of sales. We have long anticipated that new home construction would hold up better than what is typical in a downturn due to the fundamental shortage of housing units. This is one of the reasons why we still think the next economic downturn will be comparatively modest. However, the degree of resilience shown by new home sales and single-family starts in recent quarters in the face of mortgage rates rising to near 8 percent was unexpected. Homebuyers now appear more acclimated to higher mortgage rates then they were in 2022, as evidenced by a lower degree of order cancellations in the most recent episode of rate increases. Additionally, homebuilders who have been aided by lower materials costs and healing supply chain disruptions have been willing and able to offer concessions, including rate buydowns, to help drive sales. This trend continues into our 2024 forecast, in which we expect new home sales to decline from current levels only slightly due to a modest economic contraction. Along with the resilience in new home sales, so too have home prices exceeded our start-of-year expectations, with prices rebounding modestly off mild declines in late 2022. Our mortgage originations outlook, being a function of home sales and home prices, tended to drift upward over the year but remained within a 9 percent band of what now appears to be the level of originations for the year.",https://yourhome.fanniemae.com/sites/g/files/koqyhd251/files/2022-12/fm-logo.png,2023-12-14,-0.17,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United', 'latitude': 40.21839904785156, 'longitude': -79.48782348632812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Guild', 'latitude': 43.376670837402344, 'longitude': -72.1380615234375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SAG', 'latitude': 47.231040954589844, 'longitude': 17.11634063720703, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae's 2023 economic outlook was better than expected, with resilient consumer spending and a rebound in home prices.

Economic Developments - February 2024 - Fannie Mae,Economic Developments - February 2024  Fannie Mae,"Sat, 10 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhbm5pZW1hZS5jb20vcmVzZWFyY2gtYW5kLWluc2lnaHRzL2ZvcmVjYXN0L2Vjb25vbWljLWRldmVsb3BtZW50cy1mZWJydWFyeS0yMDI00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fannie Mae,"Economic Growth Remains Robust but Softening Still Anticipated Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased at a 3.3 percent seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) in the fourth quarter of 2023, well above both consensus and our expectations. Consumer spending remained strong, rising 2.8 percent annualized and was particularly strong toward the end of the quarter. Strong consumption at the end of 2023 will mathematically carry over into the first quarter’s consumption growth number. Net exports and business inventory investment, which we had expected to drag on GDP, instead boosted growth modestly. Government spending at the state and local level was also above our expectations. Still, we continue to anticipate growth will decelerate in 2024, albeit more modestly than previously forecast, due to both the lagged effects of higher interest rates weighing on business investment and an expected softening in components that drove strong fourth quarter growth. First, the saving rate moved down to just 3.7 percent in December, its lowest level in a year and roughly half its 2019 average. As such, we believe the surge in consumption in December is unsustainable and consumption growth will soften as the year progresses. Consistent with this expectation, January retail sales fell 0.8 percent over the month, which points to a pullback in consumer spending in the next release. While some of the retail sales softness was due to lower gasoline prices, most spending categories showed weakness, with the “core sales” that feed into the GDP estimates falling 0.4 percent. Furthermore, we expect some reversal in business inventory investment, and, with a weak global economic backdrop, we expect net exports to slow. Finally, state and local government tax receipts are softening, pointing to weaker future direct government spending growth. Payroll employment surprised to the upside in January, increasing by 353,000, the strongest gain in a year. Following an upward revision of 117,000 jobs to December, nonfarm payroll growth over the past two months looks to have reaccelerated. In contrast, most other labor market measures point to softening. The alternative measure of household employment used to estimate the unemployment rate remains on a much weaker trend than the payroll survey. Additionally, the quits rate is slightly below the pre-pandemic rate, and the job openings rate continues to gradually decline. Broad measures of compensation growth, including the fourth quarter Employment Compensation Index (ECI) and the Atlanta Fed Wage Tracker, indicate that wage growth has also slowed. As such, we continue to expect slowing payroll growth as the year progresses and for the unemployment rate to gradually drift upwards. Based on a reassessment of an assortment of population and immigration measures, we have upwardly revised our underlying projection of working-age population growth over our forecast horizon, driven primarily by the view of continued heightened net-immigration flows. While the trajectory of immigration going forward is heavily dependent on a mix of economic conditions and public policy decisions both here and abroad, we are setting as a baseline to our forecast a similar implied pace of net immigration through 2025 as was experienced in 2023. This led to a modest upward revision to our payroll and GDP forecasts, and if the trend is sustained, would imply a stronger pace of household formation and housing construction over the long run. Home Sales and Single-Family Housing Starts Expected to Rise Existing home sales dipped slightly in December by one percent to a SAAR pace of 3.78 million units, the slowest pace since 2010. While this was a little lower than we had expected, more recent data on mortgage applications, as well as December pending homes sales, which lead closings on average by 30-45 days, show a modest rebound in sales is underway. Combined with a modest change in our mortgage rate forecast, we have made a moderate change to our existing home sales outlook. The January 2024 Fannie Mae Home Purchase Sentiment Index® (HPSI) rose 3.5 points to 70.7, the strongest level since March 2022. Driving much of this change was the anticipation that mortgage rates will decline, as the survey reported the highest net share of consumers expecting mortgage rates to decline since its inception in 2011. Consumers appear to be increasingly absorbing the idea that interest rates are in the process of easing. While both constrained affordability and the “lock-in” effect, which is limiting the selling incentive of current homeowners, will likely remain prevalent for the foreseeable future, more potential homebuyers and home-sellers may be preparing to move. The level of inventory remains low, according to Realtor.com, but recent listings are up 9.5 percent from a year prior as of the week of February 10. The pace of single-family housing starts fell in January; however, this was expected given the surge in November and the unseasonably warm weather in December. The pace of single-family starts had recently disconnected from the underlying housing permit series. Single-family permits in contrast edged up 1.6 percent in January, back in line with the overall starts series. With single-family permits and starts now back in alignment, we expect new single-family construction to continue to drift upward in coming months. With a low supply of existing homes for sale, demand for new homes is likely to remain strong, and the limit on new home sales will be determined by homebuilder production capacity.",https://yourhome.fanniemae.com/sites/g/files/koqyhd251/files/2022-12/fm-logo.png,2024-02-16,-0.325,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'GDP', 'latitude': 51.582000732421875, 'longitude': 0.20630000531673431, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SAAR', 'latitude': 49.56262969970703, 'longitude': 15.939240455627441, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ECI', 'latitude': 31.77242088317871, 'longitude': 101.34623718261719, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Atlanta', 'latitude': 33.749000549316406, 'longitude': -84.38797760009766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Single', 'latitude': 46.29207992553711, 'longitude': 7.343520164489746, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Index®', 'latitude': 37.8980598449707, 'longitude': -83.28500366210938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not-related content.
How Fannie Mae Puts a Chokehold on Local Home Financing Solutions - Strong Towns,How Fannie Mae Puts a Chokehold on Local Home Financing Solutions  Strong Towns,"Mon, 04 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cm9uZ3Rvd25zLm9yZy9qb3VybmFsLzIwMjQvMy80L2hvdy1mYW5uaWUtbWFlLXB1dHMtYS1jaG9rZWhvbGQtb24tbG9jYWwtaG9tZS1maW5hbmNpbmctc29sdXRpb25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Strong Towns,"There are two different conversations taking place about housing. One happens in the world of housing advocacy. In this conversation, housing prices are seen as too high, and so the conversation tends to focus on how to bring housing prices down. The other conversation takes place in the world of finance. In that space, high housing prices are a feature, not a flaw. The financial conversation focuses on finding more ways for people to access debt. It is my observation that the housing conversation tends to demonstrate a rather unsophisticated understanding of the financial conversation. That is the case with the simplistic supply/demand assertion that we can build our way to falling home prices. It also shows up in the widespread assertion that developer greed is the primary source of rising prices. While I share a lot of the same underlying motivations, I have personally struggled to engage with the housing conversation because I find it internally incoherent. That is not the case with the financial conversation. The financial world, a world of predator and prey, is very coherent when it comes to housing. And very sophisticated. Those in the financial world see themselves as the predators. Those seeking housing are the prey. The sophistication comes with how the predators construct and market their financial products to the prey, as well as to the various mediators, go-betweens, and overseers that foster these transactions. For example, in the 1990s, the Clinton administration created a collaboration called the National Partners in Homeownership (NPH). It was an unprecedented collaboration of regulators and the regulated: federal departments like the Treasury and the FDIC and private sector organizations like the Mortgage Bankers Association and America’s Community Bankers. The goal of this initiative was to increase home ownership levels by making homes more affordable for more people. To that end, they merely expanded the playbook first developed in the Great Depression and then redeployed during the first decades of the postwar Suburban Experiment. For example, NPH called for a reduction of down payments. Fannie Mae—at that time a privately-owned Government Sponsored Entity (a private business with government backing)—responded by reducing down payment requirements from 10% to 3%. In 2001, Fannie Mae entirely eliminated the need for a down payment on mortgages they purchased. Obviously, lower down payments means less skin in the game for home purchasers, which means greater risk for lenders. The NPH called on the insurance market to address this risk by expanding the use of private mortgage insurance. Insurers such as American International Group (AIG) stepped up their issuance of these policies. (Spoiler: That didn’t end well for AIG or for the federal government.) Another NPH innovation was the credit score. Up to this point, qualifying for a mortgage meant meeting with a banker for a very intimate and very intense underwriting process. With one human sitting in judgment of another human’s ability to assume a mortgage, all of the human failings—all of the -isms—crept into the process. An algorithm that calculated a credit score for each borrower was considered a much cleaner way to evaluate worthiness. Conveniently, it was also a great way to issue more debt, especially to poorer people. Frank Raines, who was the chairman of Fannie Mae at the time, claimed that “lower income families have credit histories that are just as strong as wealthier families.” LOL. Raines put Fannie Mae’s (government-backed) money where his mouth was by increasing the amount of ultra-low down payment mortgages Fannie Mae purchased by 40 times in the 1990s. With others joining in, the housing market soared, both in terms of the number of people who purchased homes (goal achieved) and the price of that housing (goal achieved).

Fannie and Freddie are government-sponsored enterprises that play an important role in the mortgage market.There are many similarities between the two organizations, but notable differences as well. Let’s look at how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac work and how they’ve impacted the home-buying process.The Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, was chartered by the U.S. government in 1938. Fannie Mae was established as part of the New Deal with the goal of making housing more affordable and accessible to the general public.In the early 1900s, buying a home was next to impossible for the average person since most loans were short-term and required large down payments. Fannie Mae transformed the housing industry by introducing the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.""Fannie Mae created the long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loan with the ability to refinance at any time,"" says Seamus Nally, CEO of TurboTenant. The organization also buys mortgages on the secondary market and pools them to create mortgage-backed securities.The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, was founded in 1970 to support the U.S. housing system and keep mortgages affordable. Freddie Mac buys a large number of mortgages from lenders and either holds the loans in its portfolio or sells them as mortgage-backed securities.""Freddie Mac came later, under the Emergency Home Refinance Act,"" says Nally. ""Its overarching goal was to expand the secondary mortgage market while also creating more competition for Fannie Mae and reducing banks’ interest rate risks.""Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don't offer mortgages directly to homebuyers. You’ll need to apply for a loan through a mortgage lender, and then that lender may sell the loan to Fannie or Freddie.Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac strive to bring liquidity and stability to the mortgage market, but they do this in slightly different ways. ""Fannie Mae buys loans from larger commercial banks and lenders, while Freddie Mac targets loans from smaller banks or credit unions,"" says Ohan Kayikchyan, CFP® and money coach at Ohan The Money Doctor.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each have their own distinct loan programs that are issued by outside lenders. Here's an overview of the main programs offered:HomeReady: This mortgage can be used to buy or refinance your home and is designed for creditworthy low-income borrowers. You could qualify for a $2,500 credit that can be used toward a down payment or closing costs.HomeStyle Renovation: This loan lets you include funds for renovations and repairs when you buy or refinance your home. You can finance up to 75% of the purchase price and renovation costs or the ""as completed"" appraised value.HomeStyle Energy: This mortgage lets you borrow up to 15% of your home's appraised value to make energy improvements. You can use the funds to purchase solar panels, upgraded water heaters and energy-saving windows. This loan can be combined with a HomeStyle Renovation or HomeReady loan.HomeOne: These loans are available for qualified first-time homebuyers. It comes with a required down payment of just 3% and flexible financing options.Home Possible: This program is available to very low-income borrowers whose income doesn't exceed 80% of the median area income. You can make a down payment as low as 3%, and the loan has flexible credit requirements.CHOICERenovation: This program lets you finance your home purchase and renovation costs in a single closing transaction.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each have their own eligibility requirements for mortgage approval.Down payment: A minimum down payment of 3% is required. Credit score: Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require a minimum credit score of 620 for fixed-rate mortgages. However, you may need a higher credit score for certain loan programs or to obtain better interest rates. Debt-to-income ratio: Fannie and Freddie usually require a minimum debt-to-income ratio of 43%, though an exception may be made for certain borrowers.Income requirements: You must be able to show that you have a stable income and are able to repay the loan. You may also need to show that you have a cash reserve of two to six months available.Even though they don't offer loans directly to consumers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue to help homeowners by keeping the housing market affordable and stable. ""Both companies provide liquidity for lenders to make affordable home loans available to residential mortgage borrowers,"" says Kayikchyan.Fannie and Freddie create inexpensive financing options and low down payment programs for borrowers. The two organizations help set the borrowing standards and create more competition among lenders to assist in lowering interest rates.",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/59c05de/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fd0%2F72%2Fa7611a634b0d91153603b3a539de%2Fhttps-media-gettyimages-com-id-509540133-photo-american-dream.jpg,2021-09-22,0.193,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 42.950538635253906, 'longitude': -91.28929901123047, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Deal', 'latitude': 33.737308502197266, 'longitude': -101.83656311035156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ohan', 'latitude': 14.716670036315918, 'longitude': 21.850000381469727, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Doctor', 'latitude': -26.987899780273438, 'longitude': 27.784809112548828, 'location_type': 'POI'}]","Fannie Mae, chartered in 1938, is a government-sponsored enterprise that plays a crucial role in the mortgage market.

From a year ago, headline and core prices increased 3.2 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively, each a slowdown from September. Furthermore, the CPI continues to be bolstered by time-lagged measures of rent, which will continue to fall based on more timely measures of market rents. Not including shelter, the CPI was up only 2 percent in October from a year ago. While the topline was dragged down in part by falling energy prices, we expect that annual core inflation will continue to move toward the Fed's 2-percent target over the next year. Given the unemployment rate is still below 4 percent, a premature easing of monetary policy would risk reanimating inflation, so we do not expect the Fed to be quick in cutting rates in coming months. With slowing inflation, however, maintaining the current fed funds rate likely equates to increasing real short-term rates moving forward, putting further downward pressure on economic activity. Near-Term Home Sales Poised to Slip Further Prior to Start of Rebound in Q4 2024 In response to mortgage rates approaching 8 percent this fall, mortgage application activity continues to trend downward, with purchase mortgage applications in October hitting the lowest level since 1995, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. We are expecting Q4 seasonally adjusted existing home sales to be 3.90 million on an annualized basis, the lowest since Q3 2010. However, although mortgage rates remain high, longer-run interest rates have pulled back significantly in recent weeks. While rates have been volatile, with markets weighing a stew of changing inflation expectations, heightened Treasury issuance and fiscal deficits, and global growth outlooks, the sharp drop in yields following soft October inflation print is noteworthy. It suggests once bond markets are convinced that inflation is contained, either via a soft landing or the start of a recession, that mortgage rates will have some room to recede, especially if the currently wide spread to the ten-year Treasury rate tightens after near-term worries of higher long-run Treasury yields soften. We expect existing home sales to begin to rebound later in 2024 as mortgage rates pull back. While the lock-in effect and the low number of homes available for sale will likely persist for some time, these limiting factors will begin to diminish, and affordability will improve modestly on 30-year fixed mortgage rates below 7 percent. The recovery to a pre-pandemic level of sales will likely take years, but we forecast the bottom will be passed in 2024.",https://yourhome.fanniemae.com/sites/g/files/koqyhd251/files/2022-12/fm-logo.png,2023-11-17,-0.408,[],Not-related content.

The survey results further reveal the value that renters place on their credit scores. 87% of respondents believe that having a good credit score is important 82% of renters who always pay their rent on time reported that they would expect to see an immediate increase in their credit score if rent payment history was included 79% recognize that having a higher credit score will provide them with greater financial opportunities 78% agree that their credit score would be more consistent if rent payment history were included Crediting renters for on-time rent payments promotes greater financial stability, while setting renters up for a brighter financial future. Fannie Mae Multifamily has been helping renters build their credit through our Positive Rent Payment pilot. We partnered with three fintech vendors, Esusu Financial, Inc., Jetty Credit, and Entrata (recently acquired Rent Dynamics), to report positive rental payments to credit bureaus which can help renters establish, maintain, and improve their credit scores. Click image above for larger view We are extending our Positive Rent Payment pilot Not only are we committed to individual wins for renters, but we are also driving towards long-term benefits that this program provides to multifamily property owner/operators. With the strong results we've seen during the first year of the pilot, we are excited to announce that the Positive Rent Payment pilot will be extended through December 2024. We will cover the costs of collecting and disseminating rent payment data for a 12-month period for multifamily property owner/operators of Fannie Mae financed properties who leverage one of the three approved vendors to collect the data. Building credit can help alleviate challenges that limit a renter's ability to secure quality rental housing and can help them achieve their financial goals. This extension supports our objective to accelerate the adoption of rental payment reporting across the industry while advancing greater housing equity. The pilot's first year has seen tangible results Many property owner/operators participated in the pilot program at no cost and were able to see positive results, and our early data shows a trajectory toward better financial health for many renters. As of September 2023, our vendors have reported that over 100 property owners, 2,170 properties, and 435,000 units have enrolled in the pilot. So far, they have seen: 240,000 participants reporting their rent payments 23,000 credit scores established Nearly 58% of participants have increased their credit scores, and participating renters who already had a credit score and saw an improvement had an average increase of up to 40 points** Reporting on-time rent payments can help property owner/operators by reducing tenant turnover and lowering eviction rates.

What Is Fannie Mae? - Bankrate.com,What Is Fannie Mae?  Bankrate.com,"Tue, 30 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtyYXRlLmNvbS9tb3J0Z2FnZXMvd2hhdC1pcy1mYW5uaWUtbWFlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Bankrate.com,"The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), colloquially known as Fannie Mae, is a Congressionally-chartered enterprise that acts as a major player in the mortgage industry. Fannie Mae does not originate or offer mortgages directly to borrowers, but instead purchases them from lenders who do, in effect guaranteeing a market for the loans. By investing in them this way, it reduces lenders’ risk. Along with buying loans from banks and mortgage companies, Fannie Mae offers various loan products to financial institutions and education programs and services to consumers, helping to ensure homeownership for low- and middle-income Americans. What does Fannie Mae do? Created during the Great Depression, Fannie Mae is structured as a shareholder-owned company, though it operates now under the control of the Federal Finance Housing Agency (FHFA). It is what is known as a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE): a private agency or corporation with a federal charter to provide financial services to the public. In Fannie’s case, those financial services revolve around home loans. Fannie Mae performs a variety of functions to back the mortgage industry and, by extension, the housing market. It offers ready access to funds on reasonable terms to the thousands of banks, credit unions and mortgage companies that finance home purchases. With a commitment to “facilitate equitable and sustainable access to homeownership and quality affordable rental housing across America,” Fannie also indirectly aids individuals. While Fannie Mae is primarily a loan investor, borrowers can participate in a Fannie Mae loan program by applying for one of the loan types that it sponsors such as HomeReady, 97% LTV, REfiNow and HFA Preferred. Fannie Mae provides other types of support for the housing market and consumers as well. That includes financing affordable rental housing through such programs as its Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS), which leverages private capital to finance multifamily housing, and by investing in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties in order to help create and preserve affordable multifamily housing. In addition, Fannie Mae provides rental and homeownership education and offers access to counselors who can help individuals sort through financial and disaster relief challenges. Here’s a closer look at some of Fannie Mae’s programs and offerings. Buys and backs mortgages Fannie Mae buys home loans and mortgages in the secondary mortgage market (where lenders sell the loans and mortgages they’ve originated). This in turn frees up the lender’s capital so that it can extend new loans to more borrowers. Most mortgage originators do actually end up selling their loans, but since they often continue servicing them, the mortgage-holder never knows it. In fact, Fannie Mae, and its sister GSE Freddie Mac (officially the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) are the largest mortgage market-makers in the U.S. After purchasing them from lenders, both Fannie and Freddie either hold the loans individually or package them into mortgage-backed securities to be sold to investors. Either way, the burden of the debt is acquired by Fannie and pressure is thus moved away from private lending institutions. Fannie Mae, like Freddie Mac, has a focus of keeping the mortgage market fluid and well-regulated, keeping credit and the flow of funds operating smoothly. Operates HomePath Homepath.com is Fannie Mae’s real estate marketing website. It can be used by prospective homebuyers and real estate agents to search for Fannie Mae-owned properties that are available to be purchased. The condition of the homes available through HomePath may vary. Often the properties listed on the site are homes that owners voluntarily conveyed to Fannie Mae in order to avoid foreclosure. Many of the properties have undergone repairs, but some have not. During the first 30 days a home is listed on the site, HomePath offers owner occupants the opportunity to make offers and purchase newly listed HomePath properties without competition from investors via Fannie Mae’s First Look program. HomePath also offers incentives to buy homes through the program. Owner-occupant buyers who have incomes at or below the area median income (AMI) may be eligible for closing cost credits of up to 3 percent of the sales price. In addition, first-time homebuyers who complete Fannie Mae’s HomeView course through the Ready Buyer program are eligible for a closing cost credit of up to 3 percent.There are also certain criteria to be aware of when purchasing a home through HomePath, including: The homes must be purchased as-is If you’re represented by a real estate agent, your agent must register on the HomePath website in order to submit an offer on your behalf You must be pre-approved for a loan at the time of the offer (if the purchase is being made with financing) Runs counseling networks Fannie Mae directly aids consumers by providing a variety of counseling services. They include information and assistance dealing with financial uncertainty, budgeting, disaster recovery or other types of housing-related challenges. Here are a few of the most well-known counseling networks. Mortgage Help Network The Fannie Mae Mortgage Help Network is free for homeowners who are experiencing financial challenges or who have been impacted by disaster. The program provides free counseling services from counselors that have been approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Disaster Response Network A part of the larger Mortgage Help Network, this program helps to support homeowners whose property has been impacted by a natural disaster or other significant crises. This support is available in multiple languages, and for up to 18 months in duration. Fannie Mae loan products Like government agencies such as the Federal Home Administration (FHA), Fannie Mae operates through private lenders to offer financing options. The terms are more generous than those of conventional mortgage lenders, who typically require 10 or 20 percent of the property’s price as a down payment. HomeReady Caret Down HomeReady is a loan program geared towards low-income aspiring homeowners — mainly first-timers, though repeat buyers can apply as well. While HomeReady, like the FHA, does not lend directly to consumers — it’s offered through Fannie-approved lenders — participation in the program can help borrowers who cannot qualify for conventional loans; in fact, it even has lower barriers than an FHA loan (as little as 3 percent down payment, vs. FHA’s 3.5 percent). For first-time homeowners, requirements do include the completion of a homeowner education program before approval. 97% LTV Program Caret Down This program, aka “Conventional 97”, is available to first-time borrowers and consumers whose loans have already been purchased by Fannie Mae. Similar to HomeReady, buyers can pay as little as 3 percent down, creating a 97 percent loan-to-value (LTV) opportunity. There are no income limits with this program. REfiNow Caret Down REfiNow extends home refinances to borrowers who have substantial equity in their homes, and it is geared toward helping lower monthly housing costs. REfiNow requires borrowers to make at or less than 100 percent of the area median income, and allows for up to a 65% debt to income (DTI) ratio. There is no longer a minimum credit score for borrowers to qualify for this program. HFA Preferred Caret Down HFA Preferred is a low-down-payment conventional mortgage. Together with lenders, Fannie Mae works with Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) to issue these loans. Similar to FHA loans, HFA loans are offered through Fannie Mae in partnership with state-level housing agencies; though they offer many of the same perks as FHA loans, they come with cancellable mortgage insurance. How do Fannie Mae (FNMA) loans work? You cannot get a loan directly from Fannie Mae — even if it’s one of the Fannie Mae program loans. Instead, you must first get a loan from a bank, credit union or online lender. Once you close on a loan, it may be purchased by Fannie Mae if the loan meets Fannie Mae’s requirements. The mortgages eligible for Fannie Mae to purchase are called conforming loans. A conforming loan has specific guidelines for the borrower’s credit score, down payment amount, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and the type of property that can be purchased. Also, the loan cannot be above a certain size, and there are rules regarding the calculation of its interest rate and its amortization schedule. How has Fannie Mae impacted the housing market? Fannie Mae was established by the Congressional Fannie Mae (FNMA) Charter Act in 1938. In the wake of the Great Depression, nearly a quarter of U.S. homeowners lost their properties to foreclosure – and part of the government response was chartering Fannie Mae to help stabilize the housing market. Prior to Fannie Mae, homeownership was within reach only for the privileged few: Mortgages were short-term and covered at best half of a home’s price. The establishment of this new agency brought forward a new type of loan product: the long-term (30-year), fixed-rate mortgage, which increased accessibility to homeownership for middle- and lower-income Americans. With more affordable monthly payments and lower down-payment thresholds, owning a home became part of the American Dream. Though Fannie Mae has been essential to helping Americans achieve homeownership as well as to ensuring mortgage market liquidity, it also played a role in the Great Recession. Leading up to the collapse of the housing market that took place in 2007, Fannie Mae had backed subprime mortgages. Once the market collapsed, it lost millions in defaulted loans; the federal government had to bail out Fannie Mae and placed it under FHFA conservatorship, where it remains today. More recently, Fannie Mae has helped American homeowners in another way. Amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, when many Americans were struggling financially, it provided mortgage relief and protections: forbearance and loan modifications, as well as a foreclosure moratorium, on its backed loans. Frequently asked questions What’s the difference between Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac? Caret Down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (also known as the FHLMC) are two separate entities. While both were established as government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and purchase mortgages, and both are under the conservatorship of the same government agency for now, Freddie Mac was created following an act of Congress in 1970, while Fannie is much older — dating from the Depression years.Another major difference is that Fannie Mae tends to purchase loans from larger lenders, while Freddie Mac purchases mortgages from smaller companies. Together they own more than half of America’s conforming loans.Fannie Mae is also a separate enterprise from Ginnie Mae, which is short for the Government National Mortgage Association. Ginnie Mae is a government corporation within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that buys government-insured or -guaranteed mortgages typically designed to serve low- and moderate income buyers such as FHA, USDA and VA loans. Why is it called Fannie Mae? Caret Down The nickname for Fannie Mae draws from the agency’s full name: the Federal National Mortgage Association. It’s a kind of verbalization of the acronym, FNMA. Does Fannie Mae loan directly to people? Caret Down No, Fannie Mae does not make loans directly to consumers. The agency purchases mortgages or other real estate loans from lenders. Fannie does offer some types of financing programs geared toward first-time or low-income borrowers, similar to FHA loans; but, as with those products, you actually obtain the financing through a particular lender. What is an FNMA loan? Caret Down An FNMA loan, aka a conforming loan or Fannie Mae-backed mortgage, is a loan or mortgage that has been sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae) — or one that meets the criteria for being sold to the agency. These include the loan being within a certain size, depending on the area; the borrower filling out a Uniform Residential Loan Application, and providing proof of income and assets; and the bank or mortgage company underwriting the loan being a Fannie Mae-approved lender.",https://www.bankrate.com/2022/11/08103549/what-is-fannie-mae.jpg,2024-01-30,0.211,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 42.950538635253906, 'longitude': -91.28929901123047, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DUS', 'latitude': 15.133330345153809, 'longitude': 24.183330535888672, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Low', 'latitude': 35.84003829956055, 'longitude': -105.05333709716797, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'AMI', 'latitude': 36.033329010009766, 'longitude': 140.1999969482422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HomeView', 'latitude': -39.77824020385742, 'longitude': 176.5402069091797, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HUD', 'latitude': 53.64799880981445, 'longitude': -1.784999966621399, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'American Dream', 'latitude': 4.6327900886535645, 'longitude': -74.09188842773438, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Congress', 'latitude': 49.766761779785156, 'longitude': -106.01786041259766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored enterprise, purchases mortgages from lenders, providing liquidity to the mortgage market.

It might just take a little longer,” the former JPMorgan exec told Fortune this week. Almodovar runs the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which was created during the Great Depression to expand the secondary mortgage market. Today, the government-sponsored enterprise holds one-in-four U.S. mortgages and $4.3 trillion in total assets. Fannie Mae doesn’t actually provide mortgages to consumers, instead they buy them from lenders and then repackage them into mortgage-backed securities which they sell to investors. This provides liquidity for the housing market, as Almodovar explained. But despite Fannie Mae’s efforts to boost the housing market, Almodovar noted that “affordability is an issue” for consumers today. She still believes there is a path to home ownership for the average American in spite of this, but it won’t be easy. Read more: Homebuyers expecting big savings after realtor settlement likely in for letdown: ‘Everyone is turning this ruling into what they want it to be’ The CEO recommended consumers that are frustrated with current market conditions work to improve their credit, and wait for an opportunity with the prospect of interest rate cuts on the horizon. “There’s a lot you can do in the meantime. Just get smart about what it is to be a homeowner and save and it’ll happen,” she said. Almodovar went on to explain that her two “strategic objectives” at Fannie Mae are figuring out how to make the housing market “more fair and more sustainable,” including by offering a new way for renters to build credit and qualify for mortgages. “Before, if you were a renter in this country, your rent did not count [toward your credit score],” she explained. “Through technology, Fannie Mae is taking that credit risk. If the consumer shows us their bank statements, we can tell what probably is a rent payment, the regularity of that payment, and we can make that consumer eligible.” Almodovar noted that over 500,000 rental units are reporting rent payments today, which is helping renters build sufficient credit to qualify for mortgages. Still, despite this new program and Almodovar’s optimistic outlook on the American Dream, the average American isn’t buying their first home until they turn 36 due to sky-high home prices and mortgage rates. Compared to baby boomers, who managed to buy their first homes by an average age of 29 in 1981, the American Dream has been delayed significantly for millennials and Gen Z. And Almodovar admitted that owning a home is one of the keys to what most Americans believe makes a “good life.” She even referenced how her immigrant parents bought their first home when she was growing up and it “changed the trajectory” of their lives. “At my kitchen table, I heard, like probably many American families do today, talk about a good job, education…and saving for a home,“ she said. “I still remember when I was five years old, they bought their first home. I remember the first night I slept in my room. And I think that’s informed a lot of what I do.” Despite understanding just how critical homeownership is to the American Dream, Almodovar argued that renting is a solid option right now. “A third of households are renters, and I grew up as a renter, so my bias is that being a renter is fine,” she said. Even though homeownership is still the number one way Americans build wealth, and most Americans will say it’s a necessary feature of a “good life,” Almodovar argued that the perception of renting should change. “I do believe millennials still want to be homeowners to raise a family, but it’s not the only way,” she said. “Being a renter, if you have a stable, affordable home, you have roots in your community as well.”",https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1768944925-e1710953272397.jpg,2024-03-20,-0.419,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fortune', 'latitude': 35.41481018066406, 'longitude': -90.55316162109375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Almodovar', 'latitude': 40.3838996887207, 'longitude': -3.5955801010131836, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 42.950538635253906, 'longitude': -91.28929901123047, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'American Dream', 'latitude': 4.6327900886535645, 'longitude': -74.09188842773438, 'location_type': 'POI'}]","Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored enterprise, aims to expand the housing market by purchasing mortgages from lenders and repackaging them into mortgage-backed securities.

While Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moody's and other similar rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS issued directly by Fannie Mae, it’s important to note that: Securities collateralized by Fannie Mae MBS and issued by other entities are consistently rated ""Triple A"" (AAA), the highest quality.

Opinion: Fannie Mae's title insurance pilot program overreaches - HousingWire,Opinion: Fannie Mae's title insurance pilot program overreaches  HousingWire,"Thu, 28 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9vcGluaW9uLWZhbm5pZS1tYWVzLXRpdGxlLWluc3VyYW5jZS1waWxvdC1wcm9ncmFtLW92ZXJyZWFjaGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"Earlier this month, President Biden during his State of the Union announced several initiatives to address housing affordability in our country. We have long supported thoughtful efforts to ensure greater housing opportunity and affordability. Unfortunately, one of the proposals the President mentioned in the SOTU was to revive a previously discredited and shelved pilot program that would waive the requirement for lender’s title insurance on certain refinances by Fannie Mae. Homeownership is out of reach for many Americans because of the lack of affordable homes, regulatory burdens to development, and high interest rates – not the cost of title insurance. By removing the requirement for title insurance on these transactions, this program would introduce significant risk into the market and turn Fannie Mae into a primary market insurer, expanding authority beyond its mission and charter. During a refinance, homeowners receive a new loan, and title insurance provides assurance that a lender’s investment is protected. Title insurance protects against many risks that may have occurred between an old and new loan, such as fraud or a lien from a debt that was not paid off. The Biden administration compared title insurance to other lines of insurance that pay out 70% of premiums in claims. This is a mischaracterization of how our industry works that is either intentionally misleading or simply misinformed. The title insurance industry is proud of its low claims rate because of the upfront expenses and work by title professionals to ensure homeowners are protected. A lower claims rate means that title professionals have done a good job of resolving title issues uncovered during the title search process. In the case there is a claim, however, title insurance insures homeowners and lenders against threats to property rights. In 2022, the industry paid more than $596.1 million in claims. This is up from $474.4 million in claims paid in 2021. Approximately one-third of all claims are for issues that would not be found in a public records search – demonstrating that title insurance could not be effectively replaced by an automated search of public records or alternative products that don’t go beyond a public records search. Title professionals also play a key role in helping prevent fraud. Impersonation scams, elder real estate fraud and financial exploitation, and attempts to defraud spouses, partners or other property heirs are common schemes title insurance professionals prevent by halting fraudulent real estate transactions. Under Biden’s plan, title professionals would be removed from providing this key layer of fraud protection for consumers and lenders. According to the proposal, lenders will pay Fannie Mae a fee to cover the risk if there is an unexpected title defect. Fannie Mae is a government sponsored entity created to provide liquidity in the secondary market focused on first-time homebuyers. By law it is not an insurer nor is it capitalized or regulated to do this. Title insurance is comprehensively regulated at the state level and having Fannie Mae act in this role is clearly outside of its core mission. The last time Fannie Mae engaged in significant risk taking, it helped implode the housing finance system and cost taxpayers over $200 plus billion in taxpayer dollars in the 2008. We can’t allow this pattern to repeat itself. Fannie Mae remains in conservatorship because of behavior like this. During the financial crisis, we unfortunately witnessed several systemic financial problems caused by shortcuts to well-established processes. Throughout that time, the title insurance industry indisputably proved its ability to reliably pay claims, many fraud-related, even in a severe recession. If that crisis taught us anything, it is that underwriting standards and risk-protection should be strong and well-tested. Strong underwriting protects lenders and consumers alike — and title insurance provides a key part of this due diligence. The administration is targeting an industry that protects property rights but there’s no conversation about further reducing fees charged by Fannie Mae — fees that are nearly six times more than the cost of title insurance over the life of a loan. And under this pilot, Fannie Mae will collect another fee, while hurting an industry with proven expertise that’s comprised of 90% small businesses and has a workforce that’s 70% women. New research conducted by Ernst & Young’s Quantitative Economics and Statistics (QUEST) team found that in 2022, the title insurance and settlement services industry directly generated $30 billion to the U.S. GDP and employed 155,000 workers — and those are just the direct benefits. Hundreds of thousands of additional jobs and billions more in GDP are generated by suppliers to the industry and consumer spending that is an outgrowth of its important work. This report, released earlier this month by the American Land Title Association (ALTA), specifically measured the U.S. and local economic impact of the title insurance industry. Importantly, the report found that the title industry collected $3 billion in back federal income taxes, property taxes, and unpaid child support, to the benefit of the communities across the county. These recovered funds provide critical support for local public programs and services — including education, infrastructure, and economic development. This data highlights the title insurance industry’s important role in fueling local economies across the country as both an employer and source of consumer protection. The job of a title insurance professional does not stop at protecting property rights – the industry has also taken significant steps to make homeownership more accessible. Preserving affordable housing is also important because it improves access to healthcare, transportation, jobs and vibrant communities. Like any industry with a strong national and local footprint — the title insurance industry has operations that serve every county in the country — we believe it is our responsibility to play an active role and invest in the communities we serve. Whether it be through creating jobs or offering local grants to community nonprofits through our ALTA Good Deeds Foundation, the title industry is committed to strengthening communities across the country. We’ve seen this movie before with Fannie Mae expanding beyond its charter. We didn’t like the ending. Let’s make sure it doesn’t happen again.

This enhancement to Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) is the latest solution from Fannie Mae to support lenders and responsibly expand opportunities for homeownership. Effective March 29, 2024, Fannie Mae single-family lenders can use a single 12-month asset verification report in the Desktop Underwriter validation service to identify recurring deposits in the applicant's digital bank statement data to automatically validate income and employment, as well as assets, in one step. The same report also can be used to identify and consider the applicant's positive rent payment and cash flow history, which may benefit more qualified borrowers who have limited or no credit history. ""Fannie Mae is continually focused on modernizing the mortgage finance experience and exploring new ways to help our lenders open more doors for aspiring homeowners in a responsible and sustainable way,"" said Cyndi Danko, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Single-Family Chief Credit Officer. ""With this new update in Desktop Underwriter, we are removing a hurdle from the loan application process and bringing greater speed, simplicity, and certainty to both lenders and borrowers."" The new DU enhancement uses approved data from third-party vendors to validate the borrower's assets, income, and employment. Lenders who opt into the DU validation service and leverage asset verification reports with at least 12 months of data may take advantage of several benefits, including getting to ""clear to close"" faster, the possibility for improved cost savings by reducing third-party report expenses and staff time*, and the ability to achieve Day 1 Certainty® when income, employment, and/or asset information is validated, which may increase loan quality and reduce repurchase risk. Lenders also can offer a better homebuyer experience by reducing the paperwork burden on mortgage applicants, and they may be able to increase the number of homebuyers who receive an Approve/Eligible recommendation in DU through an automatic cash flow assessment and identification of positive rent payments**. Fannie Mae remains committed to expanding opportunities for those who are ready to purchase a home and maintain a mortgage. Recent innovations include: An enhanced pre-qualification experience through the DU early assessment to help lenders determine homebuyer preparedness and mortgage options earlier without the impact of a hard credit check on the consumer. An income calculator to help mortgage lenders automate the calculation of self-employment income streams during the underwriting process for homebuyers who don't have traditional sources of income. A down payment assistance tool to help homebuyers find the down payment and closing cost assistance they need. Fannie Mae's award-winning HomeView® and HomeView en Español, providing consumers and first-time homebuyers with educational tools and information about financial literacy and homeownership. Lenders are encouraged to contact their Fannie Mae representative to learn how to get started with DU's enhanced capabilities and other Fannie Mae products and resources. *In a survey of pilot lenders, 50% saw some level of cost savings over their existing third-party report costs. Customer results may vary. **DU will consider positive rent payment history for certain first-time homebuyers who have a credit score, as well as assess a borrower's cash flow for certain loan casefiles if no borrower has a credit score, if a 12-month asset report is present.

Absolutely,” she said. “And today, owning a home is still the number one way where families build generational wealth.” Still, mortgage rates continue to hover around 7% and the average home price has surged nearly 50% on a national basis since the start of the pandemic, according to a Capital Economics note published this week. These two factors alone can make homebuying seem out-of-reach for younger generations, as well as lower-income and middle-class families. Yet, “millennials still want to be homeowners and raise a family,” Almodovar said. “Millennials are still driving that demand,” she said. Plus, February was the third consecutive month that Fannie Mae reported in its home purchase sentiment survey that sellers are saying now might be the time to sell, even if purchasers are still pessimistic about the thought of buying a home. But consumers, according to the survey, also believe mortgage rates will come down—and “maybe this is the time I should start looking at a home,” Almodovar said. For first-time homebuyers looking to take the plunge this spring selling season (which is looking a bit more promising this year), Almodovar shared two tips to turn renters into homeowners. ‘Fix your credit’ The average credit score in the U.S. was 715 in 2023, according to a January report by Experian, one of the major consumer credit reporting companies. But millennials average a credit score of 690, and Gen Zers come in at 680. The qualifying credit score for most conventional loans is 620, according to Rocket Mortgage. But for prospective homeowners who don’t yet fall in that range, Almodovar suggests renters focus on improving their credit score before attempting to purchase a home. “Fix your credit,” she said. “Having thin credit or no credit is an obstacle.” Almodovar suggests talking to your landlord about reporting positive rent payments, which can improve your credit score. This means your landlord would report your monthly on-time payment to the credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and Transunion) to be included in the calculation of your consumer credit score. “If you’re a renter, see if your landlord will report your positive rent. Get that all fixed,” Almodovar said. “I think it’s job number one.” Education is key While homeownership is considered part of the American dream, not all prospective homeowners understand what it really means to purchase and maintain a home. That’s why it’s so important to educate yourself ahead of making what will likely be the biggest purchase of your life to date. “You have to understand what it means to be a homeowner,” Almodovar said. “So really understand the cost.” Many first-time-homeowner lending programs now require borrowers to complete a home-buying course ahead of locking in a loan. These educational programs cover mortgage payments, responsibilities of homeownership, and more. But it’s also important to understand the landscape of your local market. Throughout the country, home prices have trended up, but there are still markets where homeownership can be more affordable. “There’s a lot you can do,” Almodovar said. “In the meantime, just get smart about what it is to be a homeowner and save.”",https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Priscilla-Almodovar.jpg,2024-03-21,-0.047,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Experian', 'description': 'company', 'full_name': 'Experian', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Experian_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Equifax', 'description': 'consumer credit reporting agency', 'full_name': 'Equifax', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Equifax_HQ.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Almodovar', 'latitude': 40.3838996887207, 'longitude': -3.5955801010131836, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not-related content.

The national mortgage giant known as Fannie Mae has put its 713,500-square-foot space in the city's Midtown Center complex on market more than half a decade before its lease at 1100 15th St. NW is now set to expire in June 2029, according to marketing materials and CoStar data. Fannie Mae in recent years exercised an option to move up the exit date from the initial expiration of 2031. It's the latest in a string of space reductions, terminations, sublease listings and closings among D.C. employers trying to adapt to the fallout of COVID-19 pandemic-related shifts such as remote and flexible-work policies. The move also reflects the struggles some major cities are having with higher office vacancies. The listing includes Fannie Mae's entire footprint across Midtown Center, where it occupies about 306,000 square feet in the east tower and roughly 414,000 square feet in the western one. The federal government-sponsored company signed on for the space in 2015 in a $770 million agreement that, at the time, was one of the largest office deals in D.C.'s history. Carr Properties, Midtown Center's developer and partial owner, declined to comment on the impending vacancy. Fannie Mae did not respond to CoStar News' multiple requests for details about its future real estate plans. Carr broke ground on the property — a site that previously housed the former Washington Post headquarters — in 2016, and the mortgage giant relocated to the $650 million development a couple of years later. In early 2021, Washington, D.C.-based Carr sold a 49% stake in the more than 868,700-square-foot project to a consortium of Korean investors led by IGIS Asset Management and Hana Financial Investment. article 5 Min Read January 11, 2024 05:15 PM Philadelphia Officials Push IRS To Renew High-Profile Lease Early To Avoid Major Occupancy Loss The plea comes as the federal government weighs whether to reduce its real estate portfolio to adapt to its hybrid-work policies that mean fewer workers around to support nearby businesses. Katie Burke Social To be clear, there’s no guarantee that Fannie Mae will end up somewhere else, and there’s always the possibility this far out in time that it might end up with some variation such as taking less space in the same location. Shifting Dynamics Fannie Mae operates as Washington, D.C.'s largest publicly traded company, though its real estate moves fall in line with concerns about the federal government's role in helping to boost the region's challenged office market. D.C., like many large municipalities, has struggled to rebound from the shift to remote work that occurred during the pandemic. It has been particularly acute in the nation's capital though, as the federal government — the city's largest employer — has yet to implement a widespread mandate requiring employees to return to the office. The General Services Administration, the manager of the federal government's vast real estate portfolio, leases about 180 million square feet of office space across the country, and the federal government owns roughly 500 million square feet. Only a quarter of its federal headquarters space in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore area was being used on a regular basis, according to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office. The report also found the federal government spends $5 billion a year to lease office buildings, and that half of its leases were due to expire between 2023 and 2027. article 2 Min Read January 09, 2024 02:24 PM DC Government To Reduce Telework Policy to One Day per Week Bryce Meyers Social The city's record-high vacancy and availability rates have largely been attributed to many federal government agency workers still working primarily remotely. Availability in D.C.'s East End surpassed 25% by the end of last year, according to CoStar data, and the neighborhood has struggled in the face of plummeting rents and valuations. Those challenges are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, given that leasing volume in the area has fallen to nearly 40% below pre-pandemic levels, according to the data. One bright spot, albeit a small one, could be a new city official mandate requiring government employees one day of telework per week instead of two. The revised in-office policy is being implemented to enhance the local government's ""engagement with the community, foster a more collaborative work environment, and support the local economy,"" Charles Hall Jr., director of the D.C. Department of Human Resources, wrote in a memo sent out to district employees earlier this year. ""It's up to us to serve as an example for other large employers in the District.""

Keep reading to determine if you might qualify for this new credit.The temporary $2,500 credit is available exclusively through Fannie Mae's HomeReady mortgage product. HomeReady is a type of conventional loan issued by participating lenders and offers flexible underwriting criteria for borrowers who meet certain eligibility requirements: • Income. Borrowers must have a qualifying income of 80% or less of the area median income where the property is located to be eligible for a HomeReady purchase loan. In order to qualify for the $2,500 credit, however, you need to be a ""very low-income purchase borrower,"" defined as those who earn at or below 50% of the AMI. You can use Fannie Mae's area median income lookup tool to search for the income thresholds by property address. The interactive map also outlines the county's conforming loan limits, which the property must adhere to in order to qualify.• Down payment. HomeReady mortgages require a minimum down payment of 3%, which is ever so slightly lower than the 3.5% down payment needed for Federal Housing Administration loans. The $2,500 credit may be used toward the 3% down payment requirement. • Credit score. HomeReady requires a minimum FICO credit score of 620 or higher. Fannie Mae has a list of lenders that will determine if your on-time rental payment history can help you qualify for a mortgage. • Mortgage insurance. HomeReady borrowers with a down payment of less than 20% are required to carry mortgage insurance, although the premiums are reduced once the borrower reaches a loan-to-value ratio of 90% and canceled once they meet 80% equity. By comparison, FHA mortgage insurance may be required during the duration of the loan.• Repeat or first-time buyers. You don't need to be a first-time homebuyer to qualify for a HomeReady mortgage. But if all borrowers on the loan are first-time buyers, then at least one is required to take a homeownership education course, such as Fannie Mae HomeView. If you meet the eligibility criteria outlined above, it's worth taking advantage of this temporary credit to reduce your out-of-pocket homebuying costs. But you can't apply for the program directly through Fannie Mae – you'll have to find a mortgage lender that participates in HomeReady. Fortunately, most lenders offer HomeReady loans, so just be sure to check with your mortgage loan officer before starting the preapproval process.It's a good idea to get preapproved through multiple HomeReady mortgage lenders so you can compare loan estimates and shop around for the best terms possible for your financial situation. Once you've identified the lender you want to work with, the process for redeeming the credit is fairly straightforward.

Will Mortgage Rates Go Down in 2024? What Homebuyers Should Expect - Business Insider,Will Mortgage Rates Go Down in 2024? What Homebuyers Should Expect  Business Insider,"Wed, 27 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS93aWxsLW1vcnRnYWdlLXJhdGVzLWdvLWRvd24taW4tMjAyNNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Business Insider,"Affiliate links for the products on this page are from partners that compensate us (see our advertiser disclosure with our list of partners for more details). However, our opinions are our own. See how we rate mortgages to write unbiased product reviews.Good news for borrowers: The wait for lower rates may soon be over. As inflation slows and the economy cools off, mortgage rates should start trending down at some point this year.Because inflation has come down so much since it peaked in 2022, the Federal Reserve has indicated it's ready to consider cutting the federal funds rate this year. This would remove a lot of upward pressure off of mortgage rates.The not-so-good news: Rates probably won't go back to the historic lows we saw in 2020 and 2021. And once rates fall, homebuyers will likely have other challenges to contend with, including increased competition and rising home prices.It also may take longer for rates to drop than initially expected. While the Fed is poised to start lowering rates this year, it wants to be sure that inflation is nearing its target rate of 2%. Some recent data has suggested that price growth may be a bit more stubborn than we thought, which has pushed back expectations of a Fed cut.Will mortgage rates go down in 2024? Right now, it's looking like they will, but there are some things homeowners and buyers should know. Check out our in-depth mortgage rate forecast for 2024.Like other consumer rates, mortgage rates are impacted in large part by what's going on in the economy. Rates climbed in 2022 in response to rising inflation. To try to quell rising prices, the Fed started aggressively hiking the federal funds rate, which has also kept mortgage rates elevated. Inflation has slowed significantly since it peaked in June 2022, when prices had risen 9.1% year over year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In February 2024, the Consumer Price Index was up 3.2% year over year.Fed officials have said they need more inflation data before they consider cutting rates. Inflation has been somewhat sticky in recent months, not cooling as much as expected.We could see the Fed cut rates around mid-2024. But if inflation stagnates, we might not get a cut until later in the year, which would keep mortgage rates higher for longer as well.Most major forecasts expect rates to fall in 2024. But exactly when will mortgage rates go down? Here's how a few of the leading players stack up in their predictions:The MBA's forecast suggests that 30-year mortgage rates will fall into the 6.1% to 6.8% range in 2024, and NAR's forecast is very similar, predicting that rates will remain in the 6.1% to 6.8% range. Though Fannie Mae was initially forecasting that 30-year mortgage rates would drop below 6% this year, it's since revised its predictions and now believes rates will fall to 6.4% by the end of 2024.While there's some dispute on exactly how much rates will decrease, the general consensus is that mortgage rates will go down in 2024, and they could even end up close to 6% by the end of the year.It's possible that rates will one day go back down to 3%, though if current trends hold that's not likely to happen anytime soon.Think about the reason why rates went so low in the first place: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed cut the federal funds rate to near zero and purchased a large number of mortgage-backed securities to stave off an economic crisis. This allowed mortgage rates to drop as low as they did, with 30-year mortgage rates reaching an all-time low of 2.65% in January 2021, according to Freddie Mac.No one can predict exactly when another economy-altering event like the pandemic will occur, but barring something extreme, we likely won't see rates that low again for a while. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, even told CNBC that he doesn't think mortgage rates will reach the 3% range again in his lifetime.Because mortgage rates are still so high, some hopeful homebuyers have decided to wait for lower rates to start shopping for homes. But that's not necessarily the best strategy, as there are some advantages to buying right now.At the moment, the vast majority of borrowers have rates that are much lower than current rates. According to a Redfin analysis of Federal Housing Finance Agency data, 89% of homeowners have a mortgage rate below 6%. Many have rates that are even lower; 59.4% have a rate below 4%.High rates have kept many of these homeowners from selling, since they don't want to give up their current rates. While this has severely limited inventory, the lack of additional buyers on the market has also kept prices moderate.Afifa Saburi, capital markets analyst for Veterans United Home Loans, says that buying now and refinancing later is a good strategy for buyers who want to avoid competition and the higher home prices that will likely come with it.""Would-be buyers that have the ability to buy can avoid a potentially competitive market by locking in a purchase now and taking advantage of a refinance in the future,"" says Saburi.A mortgage refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new mortgage, often with the goal of getting a lower rate or lower monthly payment. If you can afford to buy a house now, you could avoid a tough housing market next year and have the opportunity to lower your housing costs with a refinance once rates fall. Just be sure to shop around and get quotes from multiple mortgage refinance lenders to be sure you're getting the best rate.Mortgage rates are likely to trend down in 2024. Depending on which forecast you look at for housing market predictions in 2024, 30-year mortgage rates could end up somewhere between 6.1% and 6.4% by the end of the year.All consumer interest rates, including mortgage rates, should start to ease soon as inflation has been steadily trending down for over a year now. And once the Federal Reserve starts cutting the federal funds rate, which markets currently expect to happen in mid-2024, rates should drop more substantially.Mortgage rates are currently expected to continue trending down through 2024 and into 2025. The Mortgage Bankers Association thinks that 30-year mortgage rates could fall to 5.6% in 2025.Mortgage rates for 2023 peaked in October, when 30-year rates hit 7.79%, according to Freddie Mac.It's hard to accurately predict where mortgage rates might go in the next five years. Mortgage rates are impacted by the economy, which is often unpredictable or volatile. Right now, it looks like mortgage rates will ease over the next two years and remain relatively steady in the years that follow.Interest rates are expected to trend down in the coming months and years. Borrowers could see lower rates as soon as mid-2024.",https://i.insider.com/6502322b992da60019ebeba0?width=1136&format=jpeg,2024-03-27,-0.199,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Redfin', 'description': 'real estate brokerage', 'full_name': 'Redfin', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Redfin_logo.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bureau', 'latitude': 41.28919982910156, 'longitude': -89.3664779663086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MBA', 'latitude': -1.6971800327301025, 'longitude': 37.618080139160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NAR', 'latitude': 57.25727844238281, 'longitude': 18.625089645385742, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United', 'latitude': 40.21839904785156, 'longitude': -79.48782348632812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Saburi', 'latitude': 12.75, 'longitude': -1.0499999523162842, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae initially predicted 30-year mortgage rates to drop below 6% in 2024, but has since revised its forecast to 6.4% by year-end.

Fannie Mae’s gauge on housing sentiment increased slightly in February, marking the third consecutive month of improved confidence and the highest level since March 2022. The boost was driven by increased optimism among home sellers as market conditions continued to tip in their favor. In fact, some 65% of consumers surveyed by Fannie Mae said it was a good time to sell, up from 60% in January. But that was countered by would-be buyers, who remain extremely pessimistic, with just 17% saying it was a good time to buy. While would-be buyers remain in low spirits due to woefully low inventory levels and climbing borrowing costs, the uptick in seller confidence could be a sign of more inventory popping up come spring. “Some home sellers will begin to list properties when mortgage rates come down,” Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told reporters last month. “But we are not yet out of the woods.” Read more: Mortgage rates hover around 7% — is this a good time to buy a house? Climbing rates subdue buyer confidence Would-be buyers just can’t shake off the burden of climbing borrowing costs, and it’s curbing their confidence. After falling more than a full point from October’s peak, rates kicked off the year at a low of 6.62% — but the dip didn’t last. The popular 30-year fixed rate rebounded to 6.94% by the end of February, according to Freddie Mac. And there’s no telling if rates will climb further in the weeks to come. The national median list price also increased seasonally to $415,000 in February, up from $409,500 the month prior. According to Realtor.com, that uptick, in tandem with higher mortgage rates, increased the required annual household income to purchase an average home by $4,400 to $86,100 — before taxes and insurance. “Bottom line, affordability is an issue,” Jeff Reynolds, real estate broker and founder of Urban Condo Spaces, told Yahoo Finance. That much was evident in the latest poll of would-be buyers. According to Fannie Mae, some 83% of consumers said they believe it's a bad time to buy, a measure that hasn’t improved since December. Still, both buyers and sellers did express some optimism about the direction of mortgage rates, with 36% expecting rates to go down within the next year. Fannie Mae had forecast rates would level off near the 6% mark by year-end. If that rings true that could give buyers some much-needed relief. “A decline in mortgage rates — and the resulting uptick in sentiment — would obviously bode well for the upcoming spring homebuying season,” said Doug Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist at Fannie Mae. “Although affordability will likely remain a significant challenge for buyers, at least until there’s a meaningful addition to net supply.” Home builders were also confident The nation’s homebuilders also reported improved optimism in February, with expectations that mortgage rates would soften as the spring approaches. According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting rates later this year and low inventory of existing homes on the market were enough to boost their outlook. That optimism, however, translated to fewer incentives for homebuyers in February. Some 25% of builders said they offered a price reduction in February, down from 31% in January and 36% in the last two months of 2023. The average price reduction remained at 6% for the eighth consecutive month, NAHB data showed. Sales incentives also continued to shrink. The share of builders offering some type of concession to close a deal fell to 58% last month, down from 62% in January — its lowest level since August.

NAHB Chairman Alicia Huey, too, noted that lower mortgage rates later this year should sway more sidelined buyers to return to their purchase plans. Huey said: “While mortgage rates still remain too high for many prospective buyers, we anticipate that due to pent-up demand, many more buyers will enter the marketplace if mortgage rates continue to decline this year.” Gabriella Cruz-Martinez is a personal finance and housing reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Buzzy beauty brands explore sales, MacKenzie Scott rolls out $640 million in donations to nonprofits, and Fannie Mae's CEO always knew she'd be a leader. Have a wonderful Wednesday. - Leadership track. When Priscilla Almodovar was 6 years old, she carried an attaché case to school alongside her backpack. ""I always, even from a young age, thought I would be leading something,"" she says. Today Almodovar is the CEO of Fannie Mae, the government-chartered mortgage-financing business ranked No. 28 on the Fortune 500. The position makes her one of only five female CEOs to run a business in the Fortune 500's top 30—and the only Latina CEO of a Fortune 500 business. Her parents moved to Brooklyn from Puerto Rico in the 1950s and bought their first house when Almodovar was 5, she recalls. ""I still remember the first night I slept in my room,"" she says. Almodovar shared these reflections on the latest episode of Fortune's podcast Leadership Next with Alan Murray and Michal Lev-Ram. Her experience informs how she thinks about making housing accessible to Americans today. Started during the Great Depression, Fannie Mae today buys mortgages from lenders, securitizes them, and sells them to investors. The company with $4.3 trillion in assets—equal to one in four U.S. mortgages—aims to bring liquidity to the housing market and lower interest rates for homeowners. ""Our business model is: We manage a lot of risk,"" Almodovar explains. A JPMorgan alum, Almodovar says she learned how to be a ""risk manager"" from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. While homeowners' needs are evolving, Almodovar says that people still associate homeownership with a ""good life."" ""The American dream is still very much alive,"" she says. However, Fannie Mae has taken steps to support renters, too. It's gotten 500,000 rental units to report rent payments so that those renters can rely on their rent payment history—rather than only a credit score—as proof of their qualifications to buy. ""A housing payment is a housing payment, whether it's a rental payment or principal and interest payment,"" the CEO says.

The government-backed organization said in its February forecast that it expects the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage to drop below 6% by the end of the year to 5.9% in the fourth quarter. Now, Fannie Mae expects rates to be a half-percent higher (6.4%) by the end of this year, and remain above 6% for another two years, gradually declining to a flat 6% by fourth-quarter 2025. Freddie Mac&apos;s latest data shows the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is currently around 6.74%. After peaking at 7.79% in late October, rates steadily declined until mid-January when they reversed course and began marching back up. FED LEAVES RATES UNCHANGED, SAYS THREE CUTS STILL PLANNED Rates have fallen slightly for the past few weeks, but economists do not expect them to drop significantly any time soon. Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said last week, ""In this environment, there is a good possibility that rates will stay higher for a longer period of time."" ""The housing market is likely to continue to face the dual affordability constraints of high home prices and elevated interest rates in 2024,"" Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae senior vice president and chief economist, said in a statement announcing the increase in mortgage rate expectations. TO RENT OR TO BUY? WHAT TO CONSIDER WHEN DECIDING BETWEEN A HOUSE OR APARTMENT ""Hotter-than-expected inflation data and strong payroll numbers are likely to apply more upward pressure to mortgage rates this year than we&apos;d previously forecast, as markets continue to evolve their expectations of future monetary policy,"" he explained.

Secure your tickets now! What a difference a month makes: Economists at Fannie Mae no longer expect mortgage rates to fall below 6 percent this year or next and believe that “dual affordability constraints” of high home prices and mortgage rates will also keep 2024 home sales from hitting a previously forecast 5 million mark. Last month, Fannie Mae’s eight-member forecasting team was projecting that rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages would drop to an average of 5.9 percent by the final three months of the year and that sales of new and existing homes would total 5.0 million. In their latest monthly housing forecast Tuesday, Fannie Mae’s Economic and Strategic Research (ESR) Group projected mortgage rates will average 6.4 percent during Q4. While 4.91 million homes are expected to change hands this year, deals will be driven primarily by households that can no longer put off moves due to life events. Doug Duncan “The housing market is likely to continue to face the dual affordability constraints of high home prices and elevated interest rates in 2024,” Fannie Mae Chief Economist Doug Duncan said in a statement. “Hotter-than-expected inflation data and strong payroll numbers are likely to apply more upward pressure to mortgage rates this year than we’d previously forecast, as markets continue to evolve their expectations of future monetary policy.” Even if mortgage rates stay elevated, sales of new and existing homes are expected to be stronger than last year, although the projected rebound isn’t quite as strong as Fannie Mae had forecast last month. “We believe an increasing number of transactions will be driven by households who can no longer put off their moves simply due to interest rate lock-in effects because they need to move for life event reasons,” Fannie Mae economists said in commentary accompanying their latest forecast. Weaker rebound in 2024 home sales projected Source: Fannie Mae housing forecast, March 2024. Sales of existing homes, which make up the bulk of most real estate agents’ businesses, are now projected to grow by only 3 percent in 2024, to 4.21 million. That’s about 47,000 fewer existing home sales than forecast in February. Sales of new homes are expected to grow by close to 5 percent this year, to 699,000, which is down 35,000 from last month’s forecast for 734,00 new home sales in 2024. “While existing sales rose 3.1 percent in January to an annualized pace of 4.0 million, these increases reflected mortgage rates in November and December,” Fannie Mae economists noted. “Pending sales, which lead closings on average by a month or two, fell in January by 4.9 percent, pointing to a likely pullback in February.” Diminished expectations for lower mortgage rates Source: Fannie Mae housing forecast, March 2024. Last month, Fannie Mae forecasters were predicting that rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages would fall to 5.9 percent in Q4 2024 and 5.7 percent in Q4 2025. The latest forecast is that rates will make a more gradual descent to 6.0 percent by Q4 2025. “Strong headline jobs numbers and hotter-than-expected inflation data … led financial markets to price in a less aggressive rate-cutting path by the Federal Reserve,” Fannie Mae economists said in predicting that mortgage rates have less room to come down than previously thought. While economists with the Mortgage Bankers Association predicted in February that mortgage rates would drop to 5.5 percent by Q4 2025, their March forecast hadn’t been issued Tuesday. This year’s rally in mortgage rates kicked off with a surprisingly strong jobs report on Feb. 2, which put to rest speculation that the Federal Reserve might begin lowering the short-term federal funds rate in March. Purchase mortgage applications fell for five consecutive weeks before mortgage rates began to ease again in early March. But more recent inflation data has been pushing mortgage rates higher again since March 11. The CME FedWatch Tool, which tracks futures market investors’ expectations of the Fed’s next moves, on Tuesday put the odds that the Fed will approve one or more rate cuts by June 12 at just 59.5 percent, down from 76.2 percent on Feb. 16. But it’s not just when the Fed starts cutting short-term rates, but how deeply it might cut over the next two or three years that’s of importance to investors who fund most mortgages. “In our view, whether the Fed begins cutting interest rates in June or later in the year is likely to have only a small impact on the macroeconomy and mortgage rates,” Fannie Mae economists said. “In contrast, we believe the market’s expectations of the cumulative change in the fed funds rate over the next two to three years will likely have a more meaningful impact on mortgage rates.” Unlike the short-term federal funds rate, the Fed doesn’t have direct control over mortgage rates, which are determined largely by investor demand for mortgage-backed securities (MBS). But having purchased trillions of dollars in MBS and Treasurys to keep interest rates low during the pandemic, the Fed does have influence in MBS markets that determine mortgage rates. “Quantitative tightening” — the Federal Reserve’s ongoing program to trim $35 billion in mortgages from its balance sheet each month — could keep mortgage rates from falling dramatically this year. When Fed policymakers meet Wednesday, they’re expected to keep their target for the short-term federal funds rate at 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent. But Fannie Mae economists say bond market investors are expecting some discussion of the quantitative tightening policy, which Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has said is falling short of expectations. In a March 1 speech, Waller said he’d like to see the Fed reduce its $2.4 trillion in mortgage holdings to zero. But because few homeowners have an incentive to refinance their existing loans, the Fed has been falling short of its target of reducing its MBS holdings by $35 billion a month. Rather than actively selling MBS, the Fed has been letting those investments roll off its balance sheet passively, by not replacing assets that mature. But that strategy has only been trimming the Fed’s MBS balance sheet by about $15 billion a month. To hit the $35 billion a month target, the Fed would have to start selling MBS. Even the threat of such a move might push mortgage rates higher, prompting real estate industry groups to plead with the Fed in October to go on record that it would not sell mortgages the central bank bought during the pandemic. Refinancing projected to bounce back from anemic levels Source: Fannie Mae housing forecast, March 2024. With home prices expected to stay elevated, purchase mortgage originations are expected to post 12 percent growth this year, to $1.367 trillion, a downgrade of $90 billion from last month’s forecast, followed by 13.5 percent growth in 2025, to $1.551 trillion. “We have downgraded our outlook for purchase originations due to downgrades to the home sales forecast (which in turn stems from a higher mortgage rate outlook), as well as incoming data indicating a continued higher cash share of purchase transactions occurring,” Fannie Mae economists said. Refinancings are projected to grow 60 percent this year from last year’s anemic levels, to $397 billion, or $62 billion less than forecast in February. Next year Fannie Mae is forecasting another 58 percent increase in refinancing volume, to $626 billion, as lower rates give more homeowners an incentive to refinance.

Despite the Administration's stated aim of improving affordable housing opportunities for those in need of such assistance, this pilot's focus on a specific set of refinance transactions does not accomplish that, the group argued. The pilot was announced prior to the State of the Union address last Thursday. The next day, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took its own shot at so-called junk fees in the mortgage process. ""It doesn't meaningfully reduce costs for homebuyers, particularly first-time homebuyers or lower and moderate income families,"" said Chris Morton, ALTA's senior vice president of public affairs and chief advocacy officer. ""It will be targeted to higher wealth homeowners with substantial equity in their homes."" Diane Tomb, ALTA's chief executive, put it in blunt terms, saying that the last time Fannie Mae engaged in such activities outside of its charter mission, it caused the Great Financial Crisis. ""It's a hollow attempt by the White House to placate Americans' current economic frustrations,"" said Tomb, who later added that ""this pilot is simply a bad idea; it's bad politics, bad process, and bad policy."" In its fact sheet announcing the title waiver program, the White House said the pilot ""would save thousands of homeowners up to $1500, and an average of $750, and the lower upfront fees will unlock substantial savings for homeowners as mortgage rates continue to fall and more homeowners are able to refinance."" Meanwhile, as part of its broader commentary on closing cost charges, the CFPB said consumers have no control over the cost of the lender's portion of the title insurance policy. ""Title insurance is meant to protect against someone else laying claim to a borrower's property,"" the March 8 blog posting said. ""A lender's title insurance policy protects only the lender against these possible claims, not the borrower."" Morton expressed dismay that the administration was ""being opportunistic in dismissing and undermining an industry that provides protection to consumers"" given ALTA's work to fight money laundering and wire fraud in the real estate transaction process, for which it was cited by the government for its partnership, he said. Furthermore, the pilot ""also makes an absolute mockery of the FHFA's new products and activities rule finalized last year, which outlines the need for a public comment and fully transparent and open process if a new activity by the GSEs is introduced, which in this case, this clearly is,"" Morton declared. The pilot also plays into misconceptions about what title insurance does, added Steve Gottheim, ALTA's general counsel. The White House's fact sheet noted that title insurers pay 3% to 5% of premiums back in claims, versus 70% for other forms of insurance. Approximately 70 cents of every dollar paid for a title insurance policy covers expenses associated with record searches on the property, as well as rectifying post-closing problems. That work is why the title claims rate is so low, Gottheim continued. Furthermore, it is a myth that title insurance was not needed on a refinance, Gottheim said, pointing to risks like homeowner association fees and their superpriority lien or fraud, which could arise between the time the home was purchased and the owner seeks a new loan. When asked about analysts' reports stating the pilot would have limited applicability, Tomb responded a home is most Americans' largest asset, and if the government does something like this, what else are they going to do it to? ""That's really our concern from a public policy standpoint,"" she said. What lessons is the government going to learn from ""cherry-picking the best transactions possible, the easiest ones, the ones with the least likely title problems and use that to justify other things that they want to do in a politicized environment?"" Gottheim asked rhetorically. At the end of the day, ""Fannie Mae is not regulated to do title insurance,"" Tomb said. ""They're not capitalized for this. So there's a lot more risk than people really understand.""

The Feds are the city’s largest employer, with a huge portfolio of DC office space that the government owns and leases, but a large portion of that space isn’t being used. According to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office, only a quarter of the federal headquarters space in DC is being occupied on a regular basis at a time when the office vacancy rate in the city stands at a record 21.2%.

Fannie Mae Executes First Credit Insurance Risk Transfer Transaction of 2024 on $9.0 Billion of Single-Family Loans - PR Newswire,Fannie Mae Executes First Credit Insurance Risk Transfer Transaction of 2024 on $9.0 Billion of Single-Family Loans  PR Newswire,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2Zhbm5pZS1tYWUtZXhlY3V0ZXMtZmlyc3QtY3JlZGl0LWluc3VyYW5jZS1yaXNrLXRyYW5zZmVyLXRyYW5zYWN0aW9uLW9mLTIwMjQtb24tOS0wLWJpbGxpb24tb2Ytc2luZ2xlLWZhbWlseS1sb2Fucy0zMDIwNzc0NjAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,PR Newswire,"WASHINGTON, March 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Fannie Mae (OTCQB: FNMA) announced today that it has executed its first Credit Insurance Risk Transfer™ (CIRT™) transaction of 2024. CIRT 2024-L1 transferred $355.6 million of mortgage credit risk to private insurers and reinsurers. ""CIRT 2024-L1 begins another active year of CIRT issuance for Fannie Mae,"" said Rob Schaefer, Fannie Mae Vice President, Capital Markets. ""We appreciate the support of the 24 insurers and reinsurers that committed to write coverage and supported the extension of the CIRT maturity term on this deal to 18 years, from the 12.5-year term that had been utilized for most CIRT deals executed since 2019."" The covered loan pool for CIRT 2024-L1 consists of approximately 28,000 single-family mortgage loans with an outstanding unpaid principal balance of approximately $9.0 billion. The covered pool includes collateral with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of 60.01 percent to 80.00 percent acquired between January 2023 and April 2023. The loans included in this transaction are fixed-rate, generally 30-year term, fully amortizing mortgages and were underwritten using rigorous credit standards and enhanced risk controls. Beginning with this transaction, CIRT deals that cover existing pools of low-LTV loans will be identified by prefacing the CIRT deal number with the letter 'L,' and CIRT deals that cover existing pools of high-LTV loans will be identified by prefacing the CIRT deal number with the letter 'H.' With CIRT 2024-L1, which became effective January 1, 2024, Fannie Mae will retain risk for the first 150 basis points of loss on the $9.0 billion covered loan pool. If the $135.1 million retention layer is exhausted, 24 reinsurers will cover the next 395 basis points of loss on the pool, up to a maximum coverage of $355.6 million. Coverage for this deal is provided based upon actual losses for a term of 18 years. Depending on the paydown of the insured pool and the principal amount of insured loans that become seriously delinquent, the coverage amount may be reduced at the one-year anniversary and each month thereafter. The coverage on this deal may be canceled by Fannie Mae at any time on or after the five-year anniversary of the effective date by paying a cancellation fee. Since inception to date, Fannie Mae has acquired approximately $26.2 billion of insurance coverage on $879.2 billion of single-family loans through the CIRT program, measured at the time of issuance for both post-acquisition (bulk) and front-end transactions. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $1.29 trillion in outstanding unpaid principal balance of loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business were included in a reference pool for a credit risk transfer transaction. To promote transparency and to help insurers and reinsurers evaluate the CIRT program, Fannie Mae provides ongoing, robust disclosure data, as well as access to news, resources, and analytics through its credit risk transfer webpages. This includes Fannie Mae's innovative Data Dynamics® tool that enables market participants to interact with and analyze both CIRT deals that are currently outstanding in the market and Fannie Mae's historical loan dataset.

On February 15, 2024, Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae (FNMA) released its 8-K filing, announcing a significant increase in annual net income and a strengthened net worth position for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The company, a key player in the U.S. secondary mortgage market, operates through its Single-Family and Multifamily segments, with the former being the primary revenue driver. Fannie Mae's performance in 2023 was marked by robust financial achievements despite a challenging housing market environment characterized by higher mortgage rates, limited housing inventory, and persistent affordability issues. The company's net income for the year stood at $17.4 billion, a $4.5 billion or 35% increase from the previous year. This growth was primarily attributed to a significant $7.9 billion shift to a benefit for credit losses in 2023 from a provision for credit losses in 2022. The company's commitment to supporting the housing market was evident in its provision of $369 billion in liquidity, enabling the financing of approximately 1.5 million home purchases, refinancings, and rental units. Notably, Fannie Mae acquired approximately 805,000 single-family purchase loans, with over 45% catering to first-time homebuyers, and financed around 482,000 units of multifamily rental housing, most of which were affordable to households earning at or below 120% of the area median income. Despite a slight decrease in net interest income from $29.4 billion in 2022 to $28.8 billion in 2023, the company's financial position remained strong, driven by guaranty fee income and higher yields on securities in its corporate liquidity portfolio. The benefit for credit losses, totaling $1.7 billion for the year, reflected improved credit conditions and home price growth, though partially offset by a provision for multifamily credit losses due to declining property values. FNMA's net worth increased to $77.7 billion, up 29% from the previous year, bolstering its financial stability and capacity to support the housing market. The company's serious delinquency rates for both single-family and multifamily segments remained a focus, with the single-family serious delinquency (SDQ) rate and multifamily SDQ rate being closely monitored. In summary, Fannie Mae's 2023 financial results underscore its resilience and ongoing role in facilitating access to mortgage credit for American homeowners and renters. The company's ability to navigate a challenging housing landscape while delivering substantial earnings growth and liquidity support highlights its strategic management and commitment to its mission. For a detailed view of Fannie Mae's financials, including its Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the full year of 2023, stakeholders are encouraged to review the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is available on the SEC's website and Fannie Mae's official website.

As a result, 30-year mortgage rates will remain higher for longer than expected. In contrast to its previous forecast that mortgage rates will end the year below 6%, the ESR group now expects the 30-year fixed rate will close 2024 at 6.4%. ​​“Hotter-than-expected inflation data and strong payroll numbers are likely to apply more upward pressure to mortgage rates this year than we’d previously forecast, as markets continue to evolve their expectations of future monetary policy,” Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae’s senior vice president and chief economist, said in a statement. Annual inflation increased to 3.2% in February and employers added 275,000 jobs last month — figures that came in higher than expected and reflected continued economic strength. The Federal Reserve is likely to hold interest rates steady on Wednesday after policymakers wrap up their two-day meeting. An update of the central bank’s quarterly economic projections on Wednesday will provide a clearer picture of when rate relief might be in the cards. “Still, while we don’t expect a dramatic surge in the supply of homes for sale, we do anticipate an increase in the level of market transactions relative to 2023 — even if mortgage rates remain elevated,” Duncan said. Fannie Mae revised down its total home sales forecast to 4.91 million for 2024, down from its previous projection of 5 million. But the government-sponsored enterprise also expects that existing home sales will trend upward in 2024, due in part to increased activity by households that will need to move due to life events and that are less sensitive to the interest rate lock-in effect. “While we do not explicitly forecast new home listings, a future rise in listings is also expected to outpace the growth in sales, leading to a gradual loosening of the currently very tight housing market,” the ESR group stated.“An increase in the months’ supply of homes for sales should also lead to some deceleration in home price growth over the next several years, even if a general lack of supply keeps home price appreciation positive despite affordability measures being stretched.”Fannie Mae expects purchase mortgage origination volume to be $1.4 trillion in 2024, representing 12% growth from 2023 but a downgrade of $90 billion from its prior forecast.Refinance originations are projected to total $397 billion, or $62 billion less than the prior forecast.",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crystal_ball-7.jpg,2024-03-19,0.205,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Doug Duncan', 'description': 'American politician', 'full_name': 'Doug Duncan', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Duncan_greets_supporters%2C_September_2013.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Duncan', 'latitude': 34.50230026245117, 'longitude': -97.95780944824219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae predicts higher mortgage rates (6.4% by 2024) due to strong inflation and employment data.

Fannie Mae’s Home Purchase Sentiment Index (HPSI), which tracks the U.S. housing market and consumer confidence to buy or sell a home, rose 2.1 points in February to 72.8. The full index is up 14.8 points from one year ago. In February, 65% of consumers said that conditions were ripe to sell a home, up from 60% in January. Conversely, only 19% of shoppers feel like the timing is right to buy a home, up from 17% in the prior month. “The HPSI increased for the third straight month, continuing its slow but steady rise from the low-level plateau observed through much of 2023; and consumer sentiment toward housing now rests firmly above where it was this time last year,” Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae senior vice president and chief economist, said in a statement. “Consumer attitudes toward home-selling conditions increased markedly in February, with current homeowners, in particular, expressing greater optimism that it’s a ‘good time to sell,’ a development that may foreshadow an upcoming increase in existing home listings.” The housing industry expects mortgage rates to move down toward 6% as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut benchmark interest rates sometime this year. In its February Economic & Housing Outlook, Fannie Mae forecast the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to decrease to 5.9% by the end of 2024 Many consumers also remain hopeful that mortgage rates will go down over the next 12 months. If mortgage rates slide closer to the 6% mark by the end of the year, consumer sentiment on both sides of the transaction is likely to increase. “A decline in mortgage rates — and the resulting uptick in sentiment — would obviously bode well for the upcoming spring homebuying season, although affordability will likely remain a significant challenge for buyers, at least until there’s a meaningful addition to net supply,” Duncan said. Fannie Mae forecasts single-family mortgage origination volume at $1.92 trillion in 2024 and at $2.36 trillion in 2025, up from $1.50 trillion in 2023.

"Mortgage Rates Will Drop Below 6% This Year, Says Fannie Mae - Money","Mortgage Rates Will Drop Below 6% This Year, Says Fannie Mae  Money","Thu, 25 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkuY29tL21vcnRnYWdlLXJhdGVzLWRyb3AtZmFubmllLW1hZS1yZXBvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Money,"Homebuyers could be in line for a big break by the end of the year as mortgage rates are expected to dip under 6% for the first time since September 2022. A recent report from Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored enterprise that purchases home loans from mortgage lenders, is predicting that mortgage rates will begin a slow, if somewhat bumpy, descent from their current levels in the mid-6% range. The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan is forecast to average 5.8% by the end of the year. Some other recent mortgage rate predictions, meanwhile, are saying that rates will stay above 6% this year. Rates have already decreased by more than a percentage point since last October. If Fannie Mae’s current prediction comes true, the rate will have gone down by almost two percentage points from its 2023 high of 7.79% — a change that will have an increasingly significant impact over time for homebuyers and sellers. Fannie Mae’s rate new forecast is slightly more optimistic than its previous ones because the Federal Reserve recently signaled a “pivot” in its monetary policy, says Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae’s chief economist. The Fed is switching from its rate-tightening policy toward a sustained pause and eventual decrease in the federal funds rate, which will likely nudge mortgage rates lower. But don’t expect rates to follow a straight line down. There are many factors, such as an expansion of fighting in the Middle East, that could create supply issues and cause economic conditions, including inflation, to reverse course, which could in turn cause the Fed to adjust its plans to cut rates. Plus, mortgage rates are influenced by the bond market, which reacts to every new tidbit of economic news, from the unemployment rate to retail sales. As a result, says Mark Palim, vice president and deputy chief economist at Fannie Mae, “It’s going to continue to be that kind of week-to-week movement” we’ve recently had, with hard-to-predict mortgage rate fluctuations during any given moment. Housing market conditions should slowly improve The housing market has been out of whack since before the pandemic. Duncan says the rules of thumb that typically apply to the housing market have been distorted, first by the aftermath of the Great Recession and then by the buying frenzy that occurred during the COVID-19 shutdowns. The dramatic shift in the number of homes sold in recent years is one clear indication of how strange the housing market has been. During a typical year with balanced sales volume, around five million homes would be sold. Yet 2021 was an outlier, with over six million homes sold, and 2023 saw total home sales plummet to less than four million. Duncan expects home sales to recover this year as the housing market returns to a more typical pattern, largely due to a decrease in mortgage rates. Lower rates lead to lower monthly payments and improved affordability, attracting more potential buyers who can finally buy a home. Fannie Mae is now forecasting that there will be around 4.5 million home sales by the end of the year. The recent drop in rates has also already spurred an uptick in mortgage refinancing, which dropped to 20-year lows in 2023. As rates keep decreasing, more homeowners will see the wisdom of swapping out their high-interest-rate loans for better terms. Where housing inventory and home prices are heading Housing inventory has also been a challenge for homebuyers since there hasn’t been enough supply to satisfy demand, but the road to recovery in this sector will take a lot longer. Housing supply has been running low since the end of the 2008 market crash, as the glut of foreclosed properties caused a lull in new construction. Even as the market recovered, builders were gun shy about new construction, fearing they would be stuck with a large number of unsold homes, so they scaled back the number of new builds. As a result, inventory was low when the pandemic boom hit, exacerbating the shortage of available homes for sale. Current inventory is running at about a 3-month supply, which is way too low to keep up with “normal” demand. Low inventory levels don’t “give buyers the opportunity to carefully look at a bunch of properties,” says Palim. “They have to worry about the multiple offers, and that doesn’t seem terribly healthy.” Lower rates are unlikely to meaningfully improve the situation. Some homeowners have started to come back to the market and list their houses for sale, which has led to a slight improvement in available supply. But those who have mortgages in the 3% and 4% range are unlikely to sell, especially if they have to buy another property at a much higher rate, which means the market will still be short on existing homes for sale. Because demand is likely to continue to outpace supply, home prices are expected to increase, but at a slower pace compared to the recent boom years. Fannie Mae expects home prices to increase by 3.2% in 2024, compared to 7.1% in 2023.

Yet even as the housing market rebalances, home sales rates are expected to remain below their long-term trajectory. The 30-year mortgage rate is currently at about 6.6%. Mortgage rates tend to run counter to demand for U.S. government bonds. That means when demand for bonds is up, mortgage rates fall. And thanks to a slowing economy, demand for bonds has been increasing. Specifically, the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen nearly 1% from its peak in October. ""The outlook for both short-term (bond) rates and mortgage rates is now decidedly lower than what we had previously forecast,"" the Fannie Mae analysts said. Yet even as growth is expected to remain below trend this year, the analysts say they are removing an ""explicit call"" for a recession in 2024. This forecast is the result of ""looser"" financial conditions — meaning lending is less restrictive — and income growth has surpassed the rate of inflation. Already, refinancings are surging as a result of lower rates — and they are expected to help “thaw” the existing home sales market currently affected by the so-called lock-in effect, whereby individuals looking to sell cannot do so because buying a new home would be too expensive. The analysts warn, however, that the housing market is still a long way off from stabilizing. ""A full recovery to the pre-pandemic sales rate is expected to take years,"" the analysts said, ""as housing affordability remains stretched extremely thin by historical standards relative to household incomes."" As a result, a separate forecast from the financial services company CoreLogic shows, the average U.S. home price will only grow in the low-to-mid single digits this year. The modest projection indicates a gradual recalibration in a housing market once subjected to wild demand-induced swings that sent prices soaring just a few years ago.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-01/240118-home-for-sale-beg-1156p-0293bb.jpg",2024-01-18,-0.326,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]","Fannie Mae analysts predict a 30-year mortgage rate below 6% by year-end, driven by increased demand for bonds.

GW Today,"Thu, 15 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZ3d0b2RheS5nd3UuZWR1L2d3LWJ1c2luZXNzLWhvc3RzLWRpc2N1c3Npb24tZmFubmllLW1hZS1zZW5pb3ItdnAtY3JlYXRpbmctaW5jbHVzaXZlLXN0cnVjdHVyZXMtaG9tZW93bmVyc2hpcNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,GW Today,"The impact of systemic racial bias in the home appraisal industry has received heightened attention in recent years as growing research found that properties of Black homeowners are often under-valued, and homes in Black neighborhoods are also appraised lower compared to white neighborhoods. As Black homeowners have shared their stories of receiving widely different valuations before and after staging their homes to remove traces of race, government officials have vowed to address the problem. The issue of appraisal bias being a factor in worsening the wealth gap for Black Americans was one of many topics covered at the latest George Talks Business segment, hosted by the George Washington University School of Business (GWSB). Vanessa Perry, the interim dean for GWSB and a professor of marketing, strategic management, and public policy, moderated the discussion with Sharifa A. Anderson, the senior vice president and the chief diversity and inclusion officer of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). The discussion held at Jack Morton Auditorium centered on broadening housing access and creating a more inclusive housing finance system. Perry acknowledged Fannie Mae’s work on appraisal bias and posed a question to Anderson Thursday evening about what appraisal bias is and the concerning impact it is having on Black homeowners. Anderson explained that in instances where appraisals may be required in connection with financing of a home, studies indicated that Black households were “finding that the value of their property was much lower than that of white households.” “It’s such that studies were being done where [households] would remove any evidence of ethnicity or race to understand how that shifted an appraiser's valuation of the property,” Anderson said. Anderson elaborated that understanding how bias shows up in housing finance has led to Fannie Mae leveraging its position in the marketplace to develop more innovative solutions. Anderson said one of the ways Fannie Mae is addressing appraisal bias is by using artificial intelligence (specifically natural language processing models) to understand the extent to which prohibited terms (good neighborhood, desirable location or pride of ownership) are showing up in appraisals. Fannie Mae is also looking to support a more diverse appraisal industry through their Appraiser Diversity Initiative, which was launched to raise awareness of real estate appraisal career options through outreach events and create opportunities for overcoming barriers to entry in the field. Perry also asked Anderson about steps Fannie Mae has taken to contribute to a more inclusive housing industry. Anderson highlighted Fannie Mae’s Future Housing Leaders program, which connects students from diverse backgrounds to internships in housing finance and complements their work experience with education specific to the housing industry. “Diversity and inclusion-related issues have been huge topics in the housing industry,” Perry said. “So, I'm curious, if you could give some examples of things that Fannie Mae is doing to expand diversity and inclusion in the housing industry. As it is, because of its sheer size, you have a tremendous impact on the way the industry operates.” Anderson said Fannie Mae has shifted how it evaluates the credit of a potential borrower by expanding the process to also take rental history into account. Anderson acknowledged that considering positive rent history has been a “game changer” for renters who may have a limited credit history. Using rent payment histories provides a more inclusive risk evaluation. “One of the things I think we're really proud of is understanding how [households] bank differently, how they leverage credit differently and the factors that can tell us a more complete story,” she said. Fannie Mae was first charted in 1938 by Congress to provide stability and liquidity for the nation’s mortgage market. Anderson said as Fannie Mae works to put values of diversity and inclusion into practice, how they provide liquidity has changed. “I think we are thinking more deeply today than we ever have before about what it means to provide liquidity and the way that we're serving all communities, particularly communities that have been underserved,” Anderson said. She explained that championing diversity and inclusion means creating a culture where people from all backgrounds can show up in authentic ways and contribute to decision-making and innovation, which is why representation is so important. “More than half of our workforce identifies as a person of color. When we look at our leadership team, we’ve got tremendous diversity there,” Anderson said. “The reason I think those things are important is because as we look at the demographics of this country and what we know is ahead, and even present today, there is a tremendous opportunity to serve a broader set of households. The diversity together with the kind of culture we have created at Fannie Mae provide room for people to bring more to our workplace.” She added that a diverse staff is important to understanding the challenges and obstacles that communities are experiencing now. “We're on a journey where we're listening and learning and constantly innovating,” Anderson said.",https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5401/files/styles/large/public/2024-02/george_talks_business_2024_wla_459a7954.cr347620.jpg?itok=Ny_8ubZ7,2024-02-15,0.115,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Black', 'latitude': 52.15666961669922, 'longitude': -8.11221981048584, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'George', 'latitude': -33.9630012512207, 'longitude': 22.461729049682617, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'George Washington University'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 39.58388900756836, 'longitude': -80.0374984741211, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Perry', 'latitude': 42.826419830322266, 'longitude': -84.21941375732422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Anderson', 'latitude': 34.503440856933594, 'longitude': -82.65013122558594, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Congress', 'latitude': 34.16252899169922, 'longitude': -112.85073852539062, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Fannie Mae is addressing appraisal bias through AI and the Appraiser Diversity Initiative.

The government sponsored enterprise is projecting that rates will drop below 6% by the end of 2024, which in turn will boost refi volumes and help thaw the existing home sales market. Following years of volatility in mortgage rates, the housing market will begin its gradual return to a more normal balance in 2024. Fannie Mae’s economic and strategic research (ESR) group expects home sales and mortgage origination activity to begin a gradual recovery in the presence of a slow-growing economy. “Inflation’s decline and the resultant Fed pivot to signaling future rate cuts rates lead us to believe that home sales and mortgage originations likely bottomed out in the second half of 2023 and that a gradual improvement is now underway. We expect mortgage rates to dip below 6% by year-end 2024 and for homebuilders to continue to add new supply, both of which should aid affordability,” said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae’s senior vice president and chief economist. The ESR group expects the annualized pace of existing home sales to move up to 4.5 million units by the fourth quarter of 2024, up from 3.8 million in Q4 2023. Overall, Fannie Mae expects that the slowly normalizing existing homes market, as well as additional housing supply from the construction of new homes, will help keep further home price growth in check in 2024. Home prices are now expected to rise 3.2% over the year, compared to 7.1% in 2023. Origination volume forecast for 2024 Fannie Mae forecasts the total single-family mortgage originations volume to be $1.98 trillion in 2024 and $2.44 trillion in 2025, up from $1.50 trillion in 2023. Of the total $1.98 trillion origination volume in 2024, $1.5 trillion is projected to come from purchase origination volume, a 19% increase from $1.3 trillion in 2023. Refinance mortgage origination volume will remain subdued as about 90% of outstanding Fannie Mae single-family conventional 30-year fixed rate mortgage loans currently have a note rate below 6%. “So, while many recent borrowers from 2023 will begin to face meaningful benefits by refinancing, a strong refinance wave driven by rate-term borrowers is not expected in 2024. Even as rates moderate, we expect continued interest in cash-out refinancing relative to past periods, especially given heightened levels of aggregate homeowner equity available following the home price gains of the last few years,” the ESR group said. Economic backdrop looks more positive Another good news is that Fannie Mae removed its explicit call for a recession in 2024 and replaced it with an expectation of “below-trend growth.” While Fannie Mae had forecast a modest downturn in 2024 up until last year, the ESR Group noted the rapid recent easing in financial conditions following the Federal Reserve’s December meeting and the solid, upward trend in real personal income growth in October and November as positive impulses for growth over the coming quarters. As a result, Fannie Mae upgraded its 2024 economic outlook to a modest expansion of 1.1% from a 0.3% Q4/Q4 contraction of real gross domestic product (GDP). Still, the ESR group believes the economy remains at a higher-than-normal risk for a recession in 2024. Mixed labor market signals, recent rise in shipping rates due to attacks on container vessels in the Red Sea and easing of monetary policy opening doors for inflation to possibly reanimate are among the factors that Fannie Mae listed as risks for a recession. “Our baseline forecast continues to show inflation trending toward the Fed’s 2% target over the course of the year, but risks to the outlook remain,” said the ESR group.",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Copy-of-Newsroom-Template-32.jpg,2024-01-19,0.216,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Doug Duncan', 'description': 'American politician', 'full_name': 'Doug Duncan', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Duncan_greets_supporters%2C_September_2013.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'GDP', 'latitude': 51.582000732421875, 'longitude': 0.20630000531673431, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Red Sea', 'latitude': 27.18623924255371, 'longitude': 33.788448333740234, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]","Fannie Mae predicts mortgage rates below 6% by 2024, boosting refi volumes and home sales.

Previously, the only transactions ineligible for an AOL were those that involve loans secured by a unit in a condo project, co-op share loans, loans secured by a dwelling on a leasehold estate, including leasehold estates on property owned by a community land trust, loans secured by a manufactured home, HomeStyle Energy and HomeStyle Renovation loans, Texas Section 50(a)(6) loans, loans secured by property subject to restrictive agreements or restrictive covenants, and loans executed using a power of attorney. Under the new selling guidelines, Fannie Mae said it would allow AOLs to be used on “loans secured by a unit in a condo project” and “loans secured by a property subject to restrictive agreements or restrictive covenants.” Fannie Mae first announced that it would accept loans secured with an AOL in lieu of title insurance in limited circumstance in April 2022. The government sponsored entities is part of its Equitable Housing Finance Plans, which are required by their regulator Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The initial version of the GSE’s Equitable Housing Finance Plans were approved in the summer of 2022 by the FHFA. The American Land Title Association has been a vocal critic of AOLs since Fannie Mae’s announcement nearly two years ago. In an emailed statement, ALTA CEO Diane Tomb, said Fannie Mae’s expansion of AOLs will expose additional consumers and lenders to risk and weaken protection of property rights. “Attorney opinions are merely a statement of professional judgment and disclose only those defects found in a review of public records. About a third of all claims paid by title insurance companies are for issues that cannot and would not be found in a public records search,” Tomb wrote. “Unregulated title insurance alternatives, such as AOLs, simply cannot replace the protection of title insurance.” Tomb also noted that ALTA was troubled by the fact that Fannie Mae’s announcement came without any discussion with the title insurance industry. “Housing policy has always worked best as a public-private partnership, and that is how these decisions should be made, with the opportunity for collaboration with experts from affected industries to ensure the best outcomes for consumers,” Tomb wrote. In an emailed statement, a Fannie Mae spokesperson wrote that the GSE is continuing to explore ways to improve housing affordability by reducing closing costs. “Housing affordability is key to Fannie Mae’s mission, and we remain committed to our ongoing engagement with industry partners and providers to explore ways to make the homebuying process more affordable and accessible in a manner that does not increase risk for borrowers, lenders, and the marketplace,” the statement read. Earlier this month the Community Home Lenders of America submitted a letter to the FHFA expressing its support for the use of AOLs. In the letter, the CHLA said it believed the use of AOLs in certain instances could help improve homeownership affordability challenges.",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AdobeStock_579896042_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg,2023-12-14,0.029,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'AOL', 'latitude': 40.73080062866211, 'longitude': -73.99140167236328, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Texas', 'latitude': 31.25044059753418, 'longitude': -99.2506103515625, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ALTA', 'latitude': 69.9688720703125, 'longitude': 23.271650314331055, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CHLA', 'latitude': 45.549720764160156, 'longitude': 41.96305847167969, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]","Fannie Mae has expanded the use of attorney opinion letters (AOLs) in lieu of title insurance, allowing them for condo units and properties with restrictive covenants.

Another step the government-sponsored enterprise took was to enhance the best efforts commitments on HomeReady loans. It allows lenders to lock in margins and reduce hedging costs. The enterprise said that the new features “offer increased access to homeownership.” Regarding the loan-level price adjustment credit, Fannie Mae wrote in a lender letter released on Wednesday that it will be effective for whole loans purchased “on or after Mar. 1, 2024, to Feb. 28, 2025, and loans delivered into MBS with issue dates on or after Mar. 1, 2024, to Feb. 1, 2025.” According to Fannie Mae, the initiative aims to “continue to support homeownership opportunities for creditworthy very low-income borrowers” by addressing “some of the barriers to entry” to the market. To be eligible for the credit, borrowers need a qualifying income less than or equal to 50% of the applicable area median income limit for the subject property’s location. Lenders will provide the credit to the borrower and be reimbursed by Fannie Mae through the standard LLPA credit process. The credit must be provided through the transaction, such as being applied to down payment and closing costs, including escrows and mortgage insurance premiums. Per the rules, the credit may be first used to satisfy the 3% down payment required in one-unit properties or two- to four-unit properties with loan-to-value ratios less than or equal to 80%. HomeReady loan updates also include best efforts commitments program, in which lenders can take out commitments at the time of rate-lock without paying a pair-off fee if the loan doesn’t close. Best efforts commitments on HomeReady loans will receive better pricing than others. The enhanced pricing will be similar to mandatory commitments – when lenders pay a fee if the loan doesn’t close. Fannie Mae said the changes are effective for commitmentsentered into on or after Jan. 24, 2024. The GSE explained that “lenders can lock in margins, reduce hedging costs, and take advantage of pricing similar to a mandatory commitment.” Ultimately, “the enhanced pricing and certainty of HomeReady makes it possible for lenders to pass these benefits on to borrowers.”",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1200x700_Fannie_Mae-1.jpg,2024-01-24,-0.038,[],"Fannie Mae has updated its HomeReady product, offering a $2,500 credit for low-income borrowers and enhanced best efforts commitments for lenders, allowing them to lock in margins and reduce hedging costs.

Qatar National Bank Founded in 1964, Qatar National Bank (QNB) is the country’s largest when combining total assets, deposits and loans. It was Qatar’s first domestically-owned commercial bank and is today one of the largest across the MEA region. Today, QNB has expanded into more than 30 countries, most recently entering Hong Kong, India, Myanmar and Vietnam – some of the Asian continent's most competitive markets. QNB offers mortgage financing to borrowers in Qatar and across its international network. For Qatari nationals, QNB also provides the Ready Property Finance programme, which offers loan tenures of up to 20 years. 6. PT Bank Central Asia PT Bank Central Asia, known also as Bank Central Asia (BCA), is Indonesia’s largest privately-owned bank. Headquartered in Jakarta, BCA first introduced fixed-rate mortgage offers in 2007, which soon became one of its flagship services under its Credit Services division. This division offers a range of loan product offerings, including vehicle loans, working capital loans, syndication loans and pre-export financing for businesses. In recent times, inclusivity has been at BCA’s core, and it now provides Shariah-compliant financing services alongside a host of digital offerings including its electronic wallet and a peer-to-peer money transfer app called Sakuku. 5. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group As Japan’s largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) offers a range of financial services including retail banking services, insurance and, of course, mortgage financing and loans. The bank offers real estate and non-recourse loans in its native Japan, where principal and interest are repaid by the customer using cash flows originating from an underlying asset. Today, MUFG has over 565 domestic branches and more than 110 offices across 50 countries. As the name suggests, MUFG is part of the Mitsubishi group, alongside Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Corporation. 4. Truist Financial Corporation Truist Financial Corporation is the result of a 2019 merger between Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) and SunTrust, which, at the time, were America’s 11th and 12th largest banks respectively. Now operating together under Truist Financial Corporation, the bank is the sixth largest in the US and operates across 15 states, with over 2,000 branches in Washington DC alone. Mortgage loans are one of its core service offerings, alongside personal and corporate banking, credit cards, wealth management and real estate. Truist also offers a securities brokerage service and insurance products. 3. BNP Paribas French bank BNP Paribas is one of Europe’s largest. Headquartered in Paris, retail banking is BNP Paribas’ largest division, accounting for 70% of its revenue. But while retail banking may be king for the bank, BNP Paribas still offers a robust home loans offering with an expansive mortgage finance division. It also offers corporate banking, credit cards and wealth management services across its international sphere of operations. BNP Paribas is the parent of BNP Paribas Home Loan SFH, a designated subsidiary that offers mortgage financing across the bank’s global markets. 2. Royal Bank of Canada Royal Bank of Canada, known as RBC, is Canada’s largest bank by market value and operates internationally. As well as retail and corporate banking, RBC offers multiple types of insurance and mortgage loans. In fact, in 2021, RBC’s mortgages accounted for a staggering 27% of all Canada’s then CAD$992bn mortgage and housing market, making it the country’s largest mortgage lender in the country by some distance. Indeed, RBC’s reach extends beyond financial services alone to a range of social initiatives in its native Canada. The bank operates RBC Future Launch, a 10-year initiative launched in 2017 aimed at supporting Canada’s youth for the jobs of today and tomorrow. The programme is fuelled by CAD$500m in funding. 1.

Fannie Mae Outlines New Groundwork for Single-Family Social MBS - DSNews.com,Fannie Mae Outlines New Groundwork for Single-Family Social MBS  DSNews.com,"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZHNuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzAxLTIzLTIwMjQvZmFubmllLW1hZS1ncm91bmR3b3JrLXNvY2lhbC1tYnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,DSNews.com,"Fannie Mae has announced the launch of its Single-Family Social Bond Framework, and has provided updates to disclosures for the company's Single-Family mortgage-backed securities (MBS), aimed to further support access to credit and affordable housing as part of its mission and goals. The updated Social Bond Framework describes the Fannie Mae mortgage collateral eligible to be pooled, issued, and labeled as Single-Family ""Social MBS."" The MBS that will receive the “Social” label will be based on certain scores using an updated version of the current Mission Index disclosure used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. According to Fannie Mae, its Mission Index seeks to balance investors’ desire for information with the need to protect the privacy of the mortgage consumer’s personal information, focusing on three key outcomes: Prioritize the borrower. Allow investors to identify pools with high concentrations of loans that meet certain social criteria. Propose a solution for the industry. The GSEs will rebrand the Social Index as the ""Mission Index"" and update its formulation as further described in the Framework. The Mission Index will begin to apply to pools issued by Fannie Mae beginning in March 2024 and for Freddie Mac beginning in June 2024. The Enterprises expect to assign the Social label to Single-Family MBS meeting the Social Bond criteria beginning in June 2024. Fannie Mae plans to provide impact reporting annually beginning in 2025, which will help the market understand the associated impact of the loans underlying their investments. In a Perspectives Blog titled ""Enhanced Disclosures Lay the Groundwork for Single-Family Social MBS,"" co-authors Nick Sapirie, Fannie Mae VP, Capital Markets–Single-Family Products, and Barbara Pak, Freddie Mac VP, Single-Family Securitization, explain, ""While the Mission Index name is new, the underlying concept is not. Rather, it's an evolution of the Social Index enhanced with the help of market feedback and includes many of the same criteria as the previous version. Our focus on our mission and Duty to Serve goals through the Mission Index is intended to promote access to financing for the communities we were chartered to serve. The new name, the ‘Mission Index,’ reflects direct feedback from investors, highlights that this is an Enterprise-specific disclosure, and helps investors better understand how our mission activities support U.S. housing. The corresponding pool-level disclosures will be renamed as the Mission Criteria Share (MCS) and Mission Density Score (MDS)."" The Fannie Mae Single-Family Social Bond Framework is being rolled out in alignment with Freddie Mac and in cooperation with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Fannie Mae obtained a second party opinion from the ratings and data firm Sustainalytics. This opinion letter acknowledges that the Social Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the International Capital Market Association's Social Bond Principles 2023. ""Fannie Mae is continuously working to identify new and better ways to draw capital to markets that tie directly to our mission. While supporting mortgage lenders and investors, we also are committed to addressing the many housing challenges facing consumers – including those that disproportionately burden lower- and moderate-income borrowers and renters,"" said Devang Doshi, Fannie Mae SVP of Capital Markets. ""By providing investors with greater insight into the mission-oriented lending activities underlying our mortgage-backed securities through our Mission Index disclosures, more capital may be allocated in support of affordable housing so that over time more people have better access to credit."" Sapirie and Pak closed their Perspectives blog, "" We know there is much more to be done in supporting homeownership and access to affordable rental housing. The evolved Mission Index and the creation of a Single-Family Social Bond program are aimed to advance these efforts and attract new sources of capital. We appreciate our partners in the capital markets who have contributed to the design, and we look forward to continued feedback on this important work.”",https://dsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fm-building-scaled-e1650474406266-620x330.jpg,2024-01-31,0.078,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Framework', 'description': 'American laptop manufacturer', 'full_name': 'Framework', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Framework_Computer_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Single', 'latitude': 46.29207992553711, 'longitude': 7.343520164489746, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Social', 'latitude': 42.003990173339844, 'longitude': -71.50839233398438, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Duty', 'latitude': 19.649999618530273, 'longitude': -72.30000305175781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Enterprise', 'latitude': 36.02524948120117, 'longitude': -115.241943359375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MDS', 'latitude': 51.39649963378906, 'longitude': -0.19900000095367432, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pak', 'latitude': -2.0811901092529297, 'longitude': 147.62637329101562, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]","Fannie Mae has launched its Single-Family Social Bond Framework to support access to credit and affordable housing.

Lenders can use a single 12-month asset verification report to identify recurring deposits in the applicant’s digital bank statement data. The solution will automatically use approved data from third-party vendors to validate income, employment, and assets in one step. It will be available effective March 29. With the new functionality, the government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) is “exploring new ways to help our lenders open more doors for aspiring homeowners” and “removing a hurdle from the loan application process,” Cyndi Danko, senior vice president and single-family chief credit officer, said in a prepared statement. Lenders can use the same report to check applicants’ rent payments and cash flow history. This may benefit qualified borrowers with limited or no credit history, potentially increasing the number of applicants approved, the GSE said. Fannie Mae explained that lenders who opt into the DU validation service and leverage asset verification reports with at least 12 months of data may get “clear to close” faster and achieve Day 1 Certainty, which may reduce repurchase risk. In February, Fannie Mae also announced ​ a “notice of potential defect” functionality in the latest version of its system Loan Quality Connect to address buybacks. In a survey of pilot lenders, the GSE also noticed that 50% of them had some level of cost savings over their existing third-party report costs with the single asset verification report. The enhanced verification process comes after the launching of an early assessment tool to determine buyers’ preparedness and mortgage options without the impact of a hard credit check. It also follows the announcement of an income calculator for self-employed borrowers, and a down payment assistance tool.",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HousingWire-Fannie-Mae-Office.jpg,2024-03-06,-0.352,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Day', 'latitude': 14.187520027160645, 'longitude': 1.4863100051879883, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae has enhanced its desktop underwriting system to streamline asset, income, and employment verification through a single data source.

However, our opinions are our own. See how we rate mortgages to write unbiased product reviews.Major mortgage investors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are temporarily offering a $2,500 credit to very low-income homebuyers to help offset their down payment and closing costs.The Fannie Mae credit is available through the company's HomeReady program, while people can get the Freddie Mac credit through its Home Possible program. Both of these loan programs are geared toward low-income borrowers.Interested in getting a $2,500 credit? Here's what borrowers need to know about how these credits work and who is eligible. There are a few key details to keep in mind for both the Fannie Mae credit and the Freddie Mac credit, the most important being that you won't get your mortgage directly through either of these companies.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide liquidity to the mortgage market by purchasing mortgages from private lenders and turning them into mortgage-backed securities. A mortgage-backed security is a type of investment.In addition to purchasing regular conforming loans, Fannie and Freddie also have a few unique mortgage products that they offer through private lenders. This includes Fannie Mae's HomeReady mortgages and Freddie Mac's Home Possible mortgages.To take advantage of the low-income homebuyer credits, you'll need to get a conventional mortgage through a private mortgage lender. This means you won't be eligible if you're getting a government-backed mortgage, like an FHA loan.Alternatively, you may also qualify for a credit if you're getting a mortgage through your local housing finance agency, since it's also available with Freddie Mac's HFA Advantage mortgage.Regardless of which company's program credit you receive, you'll be subject to income limits.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac say these credits are available for very low-income borrowers, which they define as borrowers who earn 50% or less of the area median income where you plan to buy. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have tools that let you see the area median income in a given location.Both the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credits are only available from March 1, 2024, through February 28, 2025. If you qualify for this credit, you'll get the $2,500 through your lender, which Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac later reimburses the lender when your loan is sold.""Fannie and Freddie's credit essentially operates like a grant in that they give low-income clients $2,500 for closing costs or a down payment and the client is not required to pay back the sum,"" says Eileen Tu, vice president of product development at Rocket Mortgage. ""Clients who are approved for the product receive the credit without getting a higher interest rate or needing to complete additional paperwork.""When combined with the low down payment requirements that come with the HomeReady and Home Possible products, this credit can help borrowers bridge the gap between their savings and the cash needed to buy a home.""We talk with people from all walks of life who are ready to own a home and could easily make the monthly payments, but are having trouble saving for the down payment or closing costs,"" says Tu. ""A $2,500 credit can make all the difference to a buyer saving up to afford a home.""To take advantage of this credit, you'll need to work with a mortgage lender that offers one of these programs. Many lenders do, but not all, so be sure to ask or check the lender's website to see if they originate HomeReady or Home Possible loans before you apply.""In this challenging housing market, we are enhancing our flagship affordable HomeReady mortgage to include $2,500 in assistance toward down payment and closing costs, helping create more homeownership opportunities for qualified very low-income homebuyers who are ready to purchase a home and maintain a mortgage,"" says Cyndi Danko, Fannie Mae senior vice president and chief credit officer of the company's single-family business.To qualify for the $2,500 HomeReady credit, you'll need to qualify for a HomeReady mortgage. This includes having a down payment of at least 3% (which may include the $2,500 credit). You'll also need to complete a homeownership education course if you're a first-time homebuyer.The minimum credit score for HomeReady is 620.To get Freddie Mac's $2,500 credit, you'll need to either get a Home Possible mortgage through a private lender or an HFA Advantage mortgage through your housing finance agency.To qualify for Home Possible, you'll need a down payment of at least 3% (you can use the credit to help with this) and a minimum credit score of 660. Like with Fannie Mae's program, you'll need to complete a homeownership education course if you're a first-time homebuyer.These requirements are the same for Freddie Mac's HFA Advantage mortgages. Your state housing finance agency can tell you which lenders it works with to offer these mortgages.If you don't qualify for either of these credits, there are still many loans and programs out there that can make homeownership more affordable for you.Many lenders have their own low-income or first-time homebuyer loans that come with beneficial features like down payment assistance or flexible credit guidelines. You may also qualify for an affordable mortgage through your state's housing finance agency. If you need help finding yours, the National Council of State Housing Agencies provides a list of state housing finance agencies.Some state or local housing authorities or non-profits also offer down payment grants or loans. You can utilize Fannie Mae's down payment assistance tool to find programs near you.If you're struggling to buy a home due to a low credit score, you might want to look into getting an FHA loan. These mortgages are typically easier to qualify for, and allow credit scores as low as 580 with a 3.5% down payment. A USDA loan may also be a good option if you want to avoid a down payment, since these mortgages allow 0% down payments. VA loans also allow 0% down payments, but you'll need to be a servicemember or veteran who meets minimum service requirements.",https://i.insider.com/65c69cce6fcb546d2d4e37b5?width=1136&format=jpeg,2024-02-13,-0.23,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Major', 'description': 'ironmonger', 'full_name': 'Major'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}]","Fannie Mae offers a $2,500 credit to low-income homebuyers through its HomeReady program.

Fannie Mae and Pulsenomics polled more than 100 experts across the housing and mortgage industry and academia including MBA senior vice president and chief economist Mike Fratantoni for their forecasts of national home price percentage changes as measured by the Fannie Mae Home Price Index to create the HPES. Their consensus for national home price growth is higher than last quarter’s expectations of 2.4% for 2024 and 2.7% for 2025. Additionally, a higher percentage of panelists indicated higher upside risk to their home price forecasts–41 percent in the first quarter compared to 26 percent in fourth-quarter 2023–with a majority citing ongoing housing supply constraints and lower mortgage rates as their basis for that belief. The panel also projects a median 30-year fixed mortgage rate of 6% by the end of 2024. “On average, our panelists continue to expect home price growth to decelerate this year, but their overall outlook was revised upward this quarter, with most now reporting greater upside risk to home prices than downside risk,” said Hamilton Fout, Fannie Mae vice president of economics. “If mortgage rates move toward the panel-predicted six percent median rate by the end of 2024, we would expect this to be supportive of continued home price growth, particularly given the persistent supply-side challenges facing the housing market.” Terry Loebs, founder of Pulsenomics, added: “This is a positive outlook for those who already own a home, but as the dearth of listings boosts both prevailing values and expected future prices, the affordability concerns of prospective homebuyers are unlikely to fade soon.”",https://newslink.mba.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fannie-Mae-expectations-3-4-24-hpes-q12024a-650-v2.jpg?w=650,2024-03-04,0.135,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MBA', 'latitude': -1.6971800327301025, 'longitude': 37.618080139160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]","Fannie Mae's Home Price Expectations Survey predicts 3.8% home price growth in 2024 and 3.4% in 2025, higher than previous estimates.

Lower mortgage rates should boost home sales and give more homeowners an incentive to refinance in 2024, but it could take years for home sales and mortgage lending to recover to levels seen before the pandemic, Fannie Mae economists said Thursday. In their latest forecast, Fannie Mae economists are considerably more optimistic than they were a month ago that mortgage rates have additional room to come down, projecting that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages will be available for less than 6 percent by the end of the year. Lower mortgage rates could convince more homeowners to put their homes on the market and boost sales of new and existing homes by 4 percent this year and another 13 percent in 2025, Fannie Mae forecasts. Mortgage refinancing volume could nearly double to $490 billion, providing relief to struggling mortgage lenders. Doug Duncan “Inflation’s decline and the resultant Fed pivot to signaling future rate cuts lead us to believe that home sales and mortgage originations likely bottomed out in the second half of 2023 and that a gradual improvement is now underway,” Fannie Mae Chief Economist Doug Duncan said in a statement. “We expect mortgage rates to dip below 6 percent by year-end 2024 and for homebuilders to continue to add new supply, both of which should aid affordability.” Fannie Mae forecasters have also backed down from previous calls that the U.S. is likely to experience a recession this year. However, in commentary accompanying their latest forecast, Fannie Mae economists said they still expect below-trend growth and that the economy “remains at a higher-than-normal risk for a recession in 2024.” More room for mortgage rates to drop Source: Fannie Mae (January 2024) and Mortgage Bankers Association (December 2023) forecasts. Last month Fannie Mae economists were predicting 30-year fixed-rate mortgages would still be averaging 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 6.1 percent during Q4 2025. With Fed policymakers signaling in December that they expect to cut the short-term federal funds three times this year, mortgage rates have already come down almost to where Fannie Mae had previously thought they’d be by the end of the year. That partly explains why Fannie Mae’s latest forecast now anticipates that mortgage rates will fall to an average of 5.8 percent during the final three months of this year, and to 5.5 percent during Q4 2025. That puts Fannie Mae in line with a Dec. 12 forecast by the Mortgage Bankers Association, which hasn’t published its January forecast. “Following the Fed ‘pivot’ in December, an anticipation of more dovish policy, and the recent decline in interest rates, our mortgage rate forecast has been revised meaningfully lower this month,” Fannie Mae economists said Thursday. Futures markets tracked by the CME FedWatch Tool show investors are betting the Fed will cut the short-term federal funds five or six times in 2024, which would bring short-term rates down by 1.25 to 1.5 percentage points. “While we think financial markets may have gotten ahead of themselves regarding the extent of Federal Reserve rate cuts this year (we currently forecast 100 basis points of cuts in 2024), the outlook for both short-term rates and mortgage rates is now decidedly lower than what we had previously forecast,” Fannie Mae economists said. Home sales seen as hitting bottom in 2023 Source: Fannie Mae Housing Forecast, January 2024. Fannie Mae expects lower mortgage rates will help boost new home sales by nearly 8 percent in 2024, to 726,000, and sales of existing homes by 3.1 percent, to 4.238 million. Last month Fannie Mae economists projected new home sales would drop by 1.2 percent in 2024, to 673,000, and that sales of existing homes would grow by less than 1 percent, to 4.119 million. “Existing home sales came in largely as expected in November,” Fannie Mae economists said. “Our forecast revision was driven largely by the lower projected interest rate environment and the removal of our recession call.” But even the more optimistic forecast would represent “a comparatively sluggish pace of existing home sales, as affordability and a lack of supply remain challenges to the market,” Fannie Mae economists said. With about 90 percent of outstanding mortgages backed by Fannie Mae having interest rates below 6 percent, lower rates will help some, but not all, homeowners feel less locked in to the low rate on their existing mortgage. “Even at less than 6 percent, we think rates will still have a significant way to go in order to meaningfully reduce the ‘lock-in effect’ experienced by homeowners who refinanced or bought during the pandemic,” Duncan said. The good news is that Fannie Mae economists expect the pace of home sales to post annual gains every quarter this year and next, as mortgage rates come down and price appreciation cools. “However, a full recovery to the pre-pandemic sales rate is expected to take years, as housing affordability remains stretched extremely thin by historical standards relative to household incomes,” Fannie Mae forecasters said. Annual home price appreciation projected to cool Source: Fannie Mae Housing Forecast, January 2024. After falling to 2.6 percent in Q2 2023, home prices showed surprising strength in the second half of the year. Annual home price appreciation surged to 7.1 percent in the final three months of the year, as mortgage rates retreated from 2023 highs. Fannie Mae economists expect lower mortgage rates will continue to shore up home prices, but that annual home price appreciation will begin to cool in Q2 2024 and drop to 3.2 percent by the end of the year. By Q4 2025, Fannie Mae is forecasting that annual home price appreciation will essentially be flat, at 0.3 percent. “While moderating mortgage rates going forward will help support home prices, affordability is still going to remain historically challenging,” Fannie Mae economists said. “Combined with a cooling labor market, we see the ability of homebuyers to keep pushing prices upward as more limited.” With rents expected to cool or come down in some markets, renting could look more attractive to some would-be homebuyers. “We believe slowing or even declining multifamily rents in much of the country will also make the rent vs. buy calculus shift comparatively more favorable to renting multifamily units, reducing upward pressure on single-family home prices,” Fannie Mae economists said. Purchase mortgage and refi volume expected to grow Source: Fannie Mae Housing Forecast, January 2024. “With an expectation of rising home sales, moderating mortgage rates, a downward drift in the cash share of home sales, and continued positive home price growth, we forecast single-family mortgage origination dollar volume to grow significantly in 2024, albeit from a depressed starting level,” Fannie Mae economists said. Fannie Mae forecasts that refinancing volume will grow by 99 percent in 2024, to $490 billion, and by another 53 percent in 2025, to $752 billion. While that level of business pales in comparison to the $2.67 trillion lenders refinanced in 2021 when rates were still near historic lows, it could provide a much-needed boost to lenders who saw refinancing volume dwindle to just $246 billion last year. Purchase loan originations are now expected to grow by 19 percent in 2024, to $1.487 trillion, followed by 14 percent growth in 2025, to $1.689 trillion. Fannie Mae’s forecasts are put together by the Economic and Strategic Research (ESR) Group, a team of eight economists and economic analysts. In addition to Duncan, members of the ESR Group are Fannie Mae Deputy Chief Economist Mark Palim; economics managers Eric Brescia and Nick Embrey; and economic analysts Nathaniel Drake, Richard Goyette, Daniel Schoshinski and Ryan Gavin.

Consumers’ Homeownership Aspirations Remain High Despite Higher Home Prices and Interest Rates - Fannie Mae,Consumers’ Homeownership Aspirations Remain High Despite Higher Home Prices and Interest Rates  Fannie Mae,"Tue, 06 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYW5uaWVtYWUuY29tL3Jlc2VhcmNoLWFuZC1pbnNpZ2h0cy9wZXJzcGVjdGl2ZXMvY29uc3VtZXJzLWhvbWVvd25lcnNoaXAtYXNwaXJhdGlvbnMtcmVtYWluLWhpZ2gtZGVzcGl0ZS1oaWdoZXItaG9tZS1wcmljZXMtYW5kLWludGVyZXN0LXJhdGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fannie Mae,"Understandably, how people define ""living the good life"" varies widely from household to household. Many prioritize financial security. Others point to health, location, work-life balance, or meaningful personal relationships. At Fannie Mae, because of the critical role we play in the housing market, we wanted to better understand how the desire to own a home relates to other life aspirations. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Fannie Mae's Economic & Strategic Research (ESR) Group asked consumers which factors are most important to them as they consider ""the good life"" – defined by the survey as the ""life they'd like to have."" All but one of the eleven listed factors were very important to a large majority of people across all demographic groups. Two years later, we wondered whether consumers' priorities may have changed following the pandemic, domestic and international unrest, and significant increases in interest rates and home prices. To our surprise, we found that consumers' sense of ""living the good life"" has remained largely unchanged over the last two years, although there is interesting nuance when examining the data across race, age, income, and homeownership status. Click image above for larger view Aspirations of Homeownership and the Associated Benefits Consumers once again ranked financial security and good health at the very top of their ""good life"" list. Owning a home remains very important, with 86% of respondents saying so, but it ranked sixth out of the eleven possible options, roughly on par with having good friends (90%) and having a happy marriage or romantic relationship (86%). Additionally, more than twice as many consumers consider owning a home to be important compared to ""owning really nice things,"" such as cars, electronics, jewelry, or clothing (36%). Looking at the data across racial and homeownership status lines, a greater share of Hispanic renters (92%) consider homeownership to be important than Black renters (79%) and White renters (74%). Additionally, our survey asked consumers to consider the financial and non-financial (or lifestyle) benefits derived from either owning or renting. Respondents overwhelmingly indicated that owning a home was preferable to renting in every aspect listed. The top three were having control over what you do with your living space (94%) to having a sense of privacy and security (91%) and having a good place for your family or to raise your children (90%) – all of which were essentially unchanged from the 2020 survey. ""Having less stress"" brought up the rear at a still-commanding 66%, up 10 percentage points from 2020. In fact, associating homeownership with ""having less stress"" was one of the biggest shifts between the two most recent data sets. It was particularly true among renters (60% in 2022 compared to 40% in 2020). One possible explanation is that many renters have experienced significant rent price increases and, despite declining home purchase affordability, view a fixed mortgage payment as less stressful. Another is that homeownership may be perceived as offering greater privacy and security than renting, a lifestyle benefit that may have proved especially desirable three years into a pandemic. Another statistically significant change between the two surveys: In 2022, 88% of Black consumers viewed ""living in a place where you and your family feel safe"" as a benefit of homeownership, significantly higher than two years ago (72%). For context, the percentage of the general population that listed that particular benefit also rose over the two-year period, but slightly less (from 83% to 88%). Investment Safety and Financial Potential Our research also found relative stability in how consumers continue to view homes as an investment since 2010 when we started asking these questions. Overall, most homeowners (76%) in 2022 believed buying a home is a safe investment, though renters (59%) were a bit more skeptical of that position. The two groups were far more aligned when it comes to believing that buying a home has a lot of potential (75% homeowner, 70% renters) – survey highs for each. Click image above for larger view Unsurprisingly, given the financial market turbulence during the survey period, the general consumer view in 2022 of the safety of different investment options – including homes, mutual funds, money market/savings account, stocks, and government/corporate bonds – fell across the board compared to Q4 2020. Notably, this data was collected several months before the eventual collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which we believe likely further diminished consumer banking sentiment. Consumers' Enduring Aspiration to Own a Home With many, including us, predicting a recession, the resiliency of consumers' perceptions of homeownership relative to other investment options is noteworthy, especially during the previous three-year period of significant economic uncertainty. The survey data shows that consumers see homeownership as helping to deliver on a sense of financial security, which was also tied as the primary factor associated with the ""good life."" In fact, homeownership has strongly persisted as a perceived leading source of financial benefits dating all the way back to 2010, when we began the National Housing Survey. Given the consistency of our survey results, we expect consumers' longstanding and highly favorable attitude toward homeownership as an investment option will continue to persist, even in the face of possible recession. Finally, in further support of homeownership's enduring appeal, our data showed clear non-financial benefits to owning a home, as well, that we believe provide additional dimensions of value for consumers that, for the most part, other financial assets do not confer.

This marks a departure from the previous multifamily financing requirement of 15-25% down payments for duplexes, triplexes, and four-plexes. This new option presents a great opportunity for individuals looking to invest in multifamily homes while also enjoying the benefits of homeownership. Prospective owner-landlords can now afford these properties more easily, thanks to the reduced down payment requirement by Fannie Mae. Check your home buying options. Start here Expanded financing choices and easier approvals for multifamily homes The policy change applies to standard purchases, no-cash-out refinances, HomeReady, and HomeStyle Renovation loans for owner-occupied transactions. This means that first-time buyers and individuals seeking to offset high mortgage payments can take advantage of Fannie Mae’s more accessible financing options. The maximum loan amount allowed for these 2-4 unit properties is set at $1,396,800, ensuring that larger and more expensive properties can be purchased with flexibility. Additionally, the elimination of the FHA self-sufficiency test for 3-4 unit properties means that buyers will face fewer hurdles when seeking pre-approval for these types of multifamily homes. Check your home buying options. Start here Taking advantage of Fannie Mae’s policy change Mortgage loan borrowers interested in taking advantage of this opportunity can apply now, with the changes set to take effect in Fannie Mae’s system after November 18, 2023. This gives potential buyers a chance to prepare and gather all the necessary documentation before the new policy implementation. For owner-occupant landlords, this policy shift represents a significant opportunity to reduce mortgage payments by leveraging rental income. The ability to make a smaller down payment not only makes multifamily homes more accessible, but it also allows home buyers to gain valuable landlord experience, as they have the opportunity to collect rent from other units while simultaneously building equity in their own property. Fannie Mae’s move to lower the down payment requirements for multifamily homes is a promising step towards improving access to credit and affordable rental housing. With this progressive policy change, the dream of owning a multifamily home while generating rental income is becoming more attainable for mortgage loan borrowers. Time to make a move?

In 1982, the 500, 600, 700, and 800 buildings created Phase II of the development — 79 deed-restricted ownership units. Most units are APCHA Category 4, though there are some Category 1 and 3 units; categories are based on income. The majority of units are two-bedroom. Buildings in Phase II appear to have issues with standing, contaminated water, though it’s unclear which buildings, according to a copy of the Hunter Creek Phase II Board of Directors’ meeting from June 2023, obtained by a prospective Hunter Creek buyer and given to The Aspen Times. “Asked SGM about the water under buildings and removal. Lining crawl spaces may be the next best solution vs. trying to get the water out. To remove the water would require a $10 million price tag. Superfund site ground water will have significant contamination. Removal of specific contaminants would require a processing plant on site and then the removal of that byproduct to another state,” the minutes read under “ground water assessment” bullet point. “Would need to drill a well on Commons Property to keep water levels out of the building and pump it into this well. Clean water can be removed … bad water needs to be packaged up and shipped out of state. What can be done to mitigate without spending $10m. Install a barrier – similar to Radon – and then add air flow, etc. to keep air flowing.” The following subhead in the minutes covered crawl-space access and how work in a space with a single egress, a confined space, can be more expensive. Estimates for work in the crawl spaces — though whether that work is tied to the ground water assessment is unclear — is estimated at $15,000 per building in the minutes. The minutes also said the board had $457,000 in cash on hand as of June 7, 2023. Board of Directors (BOD) President Roy Saba and Secretary Deborah Tullman did not respond to requests for comment. Mike Viola of property management company Romero Group and senior association manager at Hunter Creek declined to comment. Civil engineering company SGM directed all questions to the BOD. The Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae, is a leading provider of mortgage financing in the country. It purchases mortgages from lenders to allow greater liquidity and further the churn of the residential real estate market. The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is a product of its involvement in the housing market. Fannie Mae uses a tool called the Condo Project Manager (CPM) to track eligibility for projects nationwide. Lenders can see if the project is eligible for its loan to be purchased by Fannie Mae through the tool. The CPM page for a Hunter Creek Condominiums For Phase II, Inc., obtained by The Times, says the project is “unavailable” as of Oct. 26, 2023. The reason for change is that the project “is in need of critical repairs and may have conditions such as material deficiencies and significant deferred maintenance.” “When a project has failed to meet one or more of our Selling Guide project standards requirements (Selling Guide B4-2), units in that project are ineligible for sale to Fannie Mae. We communicate that information to lenders via CPM by making it ‘unavailable,'” a Fannie Mae spokesperson wrote in an email. “Fannie Mae only discloses our condo project eligibility determinations to entities that are Fannie Mae-approved Seller/Servicers or to counterparties that have a legitimate business need to access CPM.” The “unavailable” status in its CPM means all units in Hunter Creek Phase II are ineligible for financing involved with a majority of national lenders, so any lender who packages and sells loans to Fannie Mae or other government-sponsored enterprises like Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, cannot work with a Hunter Creek Phase II buyer or seller. Katie Erickson is a senior loan officer with Bay Equity Home Loans in Basalt. She has a history of working with deed-restricted properties and has worked with Hunter Creek Phase II buyers and sellers. “We have to comply with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s criteria. And we also do (a) check against (the CPM) where it shows if it’s already approved or if it’s unavailable,” she said. “That (unavailable status) is a hard stop for anyone that does Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgages. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won’t take the loan. Conventional loans are off the table.” What exactly triggered the change in status in the CPM is not certain, but she and Carolyn Hamlet, president of the Hamlet Financial Corporation, said it is likely that Fannie Mae found out by reviewing the BOD meeting minutes. That information could have come from an underwriter or an appraiser, they said. “That came out with somebody who read the meeting minutes or learned about it, and somehow that got forwarded into the system that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac look to when they determine whether a project is eligible for them to purchase a loan in that project,” Hamlet said. She worked with a recent lottery winner of a unit in Hunter Creek Phase II to secure financing, then had to help the client find a new lender after they discovered the project was unavailable for Fannie Mae. What this means for buyers and sellers The issue can be resolved, Erickson stressed. But the questions of cost and timeline still remain. “It’s not a new situation that has never happened before. It will impact people right now, but it’ll get worked through,” she said. “And I don’t know how long it’s going to take, but it will get worked through. It’s just really unfortunate when it happens.” She pointed to Centennial Condominiums, a deed-restricted development in Aspen whose Homeowners Association has been in litigation with the City of Aspen and the APCHA on and off for years over the financial responsibility for home repairs. Due to the scope of those home repair issues and litigation, it is non-warrantable, she said. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is a conventional mortgage structure, but smaller, local banks offer other loan structures that do not require selling the bank’s mortgage portfolio to entities like Fannie Mae. Therefore, they are not beholden to Fannie Mae criteria. Tyler Barletta is the senior vice president of FirstBank in Aspen. He said that local banks are better equipped to serve local, deed-restricted buyers because of their familiarity with the community. Condominiums can be warrantable or non-warrantable, meaning they can comply or not comply with the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or other government-guaranteed lenders’ rules for approving a loan. Generally, this means the occupany mix of the complex and whether or not short-term rentals, amongst other things, can impact warrantability. It’s a different designation than a project being “unavailable” but the same outcome: The mortgage cannot be packaged and sold. Barletta said his bank will check to see if a condo is warrantable, and if not, it narrows the loan offerings for a borrower. It does not preclude them from getting a loan, but it could mean more money out of a borrower’s pocket. “Most people in general don’t want to put a large down payment. And Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac typically will allow up to, I think, as little as 3% down. Versus if we go portfolio side, right, we’d ask for 20% down, regardless of if (the property is) warrantable or not,” he said. “And then again, if there’s an issue with the condo complex, if it’s not warrantable, or if it’s a house, even — there’s a couple things that fall outside of our internal policies — we would require an extra 5%. So you’re looking at 25% versus, like, 3% down.” The exact structure, like a 15- or 30-year fixed or arm products, depends on a litany of circumstances unique to a potential borrower and a lender. But generally, he said, mortgages through local banks that stay in their portfolios require a higher down payment and it may impact the interest rate of the loan. And many condo complexes in the region and other mountain towns are non-warrantable, he said, because of things like short-term rentals or their mixed-use. So local banks have loan offerings for buyers whose prospective properties fall outside of Fannie Mae guidelines — whether that’s unwarrantable or being deemed “unavailable.” He said that they must present potential borrowers with every option, whether that’s an internal portfolio loan or a secondary market loan that could be sold. Erickson said she prefers to present the “best” option to clients among all options. Refinancing may be an option for some buyers, but variable circumstances like personal finances and complex conditions are all dependent on that outcome. . “That happens all the time … just get into the place. You won the (APCHA) lottery. You’ve been playing the lottery for 20 years,” she said. “Take it if you can live with those HOA dues.” Hunter Creek is known for having very high BOD dues. In one recent APCHA lottery for a Hunter Creek Phase II property, the list is down to winner number nine. A multitude of circumstances could be the cause for moving so far down the list, but high dues and difficulty securing a lower down payment on a mortgage could be responsible. Four Vine Street properties, all Hunter Creek Phase II, have gone through the APCHA lottery process since the Oct. 26, 2023, status change with Fannie Mae. At least one resident has a closing date set for Jan. 31, though their financing is still not secured. The property manager and BOD declined or did not respond to requests for comment, so a timeline or potential cost for mitigation is unclear. Fannie Mae does not release CPM data publicly, so it is unclear if the “unavailable” status applies to the free-market Phase I and Phase III buildings that make up the rest of Hunter Creek Condominiums. But they operate relatively independently with their own respective BODs and record separate minutes.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2024/01/18172942/DSC_0969-1024x683.jpg,2024-01-18,-0.29,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Superfund', 'full_name': 'Superfund', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/SV_kapfenberg_1846.JPG'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Mike Viola', 'description': 'American singer-songwriter', 'full_name': 'Mike Viola', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Mike_Viola.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'FirstBank', 'description': 'Seattle-based bank, merged into Bank of America', 'full_name': 'Seafirst Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Seafirst_Bank_logo.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hunter Creek', 'latitude': 65.48249816894531, 'longitude': -150.08056640625, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Aspen', 'latitude': 39.19110107421875, 'longitude': -106.81754302978516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Vine', 'latitude': 36.57154083251953, 'longitude': -76.07659912109375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SGM', 'latitude': 50.3942985534668, 'longitude': -4.308760166168213, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Commons', 'latitude': 43.08414840698242, 'longitude': -96.16780090332031, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Radon', 'latitude': 48.50389862060547, 'longitude': 0.10249999910593033, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'BOD', 'latitude': 14.777219772338867, 'longitude': -17.21360969543457, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mike', 'latitude': 46.13331985473633, 'longitude': -107.10839080810547, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Romero', 'latitude': 3.0558300018310547, 'longitude': -74.98444366455078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 39.58388900756836, 'longitude': -80.0374984741211, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CPM', 'latitude': 51.462501525878906, 'longitude': -2.1152501106262207, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bay', 'latitude': 40.653560638427734, 'longitude': -111.83770751953125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Basalt', 'latitude': 39.36886978149414, 'longitude': -107.03282165527344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hamlet', 'latitude': 6.5676398277282715, 'longitude': -57.809871673583984, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Erickson', 'latitude': 50.49811935424805, 'longitude': -99.9122314453125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Centennial', 'latitude': 39.579158782958984, 'longitude': -104.87692260742188, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'City of Aspen', 'latitude': 39.195560455322266, 'longitude': -106.83820343017578, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Barletta', 'latitude': 41.31182861328125, 'longitude': 16.290769577026367, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HOA', 'latitude': -5.733329772949219, 'longitude': 132.5500030517578, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Four Vine Street'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'III', 'latitude': 16.59556007385254, 'longitude': -11.909170150756836, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]","Fannie Mae has deemed Hunter Creek Condominiums Phase II ""unavailable"" for conventional loans due to critical repairs and deferred maintenance.

Fannie Mae keeps a secret condo blacklist. Why? - The Boston Globe,Fannie Mae keeps a secret condo blacklist. Why?

It doesn’t notify the developments when they’ve been added to the list, which mortgage lenders can access via a Fannie Mae tool. Fannie Mae makes the lenders agree not to tell anyone. A notice at the top, highlighted in yellow, says: “Fannie Mae Confidential and Proprietary — Subject to Non-Disclosure Obligations.” Why are sellers and buyers being left in the dark? Fannie Mae and its sister organization, the Federal Home loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, buy home mortgages, package them, and sell them to investors, making it possible for borrowers in low-income brackets with lower credit scores and little saved for a down payment to get loans. The Federal Housing Finance Agency oversees it all. Together, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac support 70 percent of the mortgage market, according to the National Association of Realtors. If people want to buy properties that Fannie Mae won’t touch, they have to search elsewhere for a loan, which could ratchet up costs for some of the most vulnerable people in the housing market. Fannie Mae’s August “Condo Unavailable Projects & Phases Report” said this of Perricone’s Lafayette Lofts: “Project identified with significant deferred maintenance. Project identified with water infiltration, which is causing deteriorated mortar joints and cracking.” Cracking in the exterior? The foundation? A non-structural wall? The chimney? The spreadsheet doesn’t specify. Perricone said the foundation is old, like many in the Financial District, but no experts have identified actual structural issues with the property. According to data obtained by the Globe, there were 1,770 developments in the United States on the list in May. By August, there were 2,001. As of October, there were 2,306. Thirty-seven of them were in Massachusetts, 1.6 percent of that list. Florida had the most (34.5 percent), followed by California (10.3 percent) and South Carolina (4.6 percent). The other New England states had fewer blacklisted properties than Massachusetts: Connecticut: 13Maine: 10New Hampshire: 14Rhode Island: 6Vermont: 9 Orest Tomaselli is president of project review for Condotek, a technology and information firm that streamlines the lending process for condo buyers by reviewing and warranting condo and co-op properties for lenders. After the fatal collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside, Fla., in 2021, Tomaselli said, Fannie Mae changed its eligibility requirements and ramped up enforcement. There were 200 to 300 associations on the non-eligibility list a little over a year ago, he said, but the most recent list, released on Oct. 24, had 2,308. Aging infrastructure was prevalent in their decisions to change the guidelines for a while, he added. Condominium developments present different risks to mortgage lenders than single-family homes. If a development includes a commercial component, not enough of the units are owner-occupied, the development is involved in litigation, or there are a lot of unit owners in arrears on fees, Fannie Mae may add it to the list. When a prospective buyer applies for a loan intended to be sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the underwriter sends a questionnaire to the property manager or condominium board of trustees. How they respond plays a key role in whether or not the property is blacklisted. If an association discovers it’s on the blacklist, a Fannie Mae spokesperson said, there is a way to get off it. “We encourage HOAs and lenders to provide sufficient documentation to Fannie Mae when eligibility issues have been resolved,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. Tomaselli, whose company also works with condo and co-op boards to align their properties with Fannie and Freddie lending guidelines so they can petition to have the property removed from the list, said he doesn’t know why Fannie Mae would keep its spreadsheet secret when the Department of Housing and Urban Development makes its denial of participation list public. When Fannie Mae adds a condo development to the list, it should send a notification to the property manager or the association so they’re aware of it, Tomaselli said. But what about the unsuspecting buyers who think they’ve landed a home at last only to be denied? The Fannie Mae spokesperson said it’s a lender’s responsibility to inform buyers about the eligibility of a property: “As a secondary-market participant, we believe that lenders are in the best position to have conversations with their customers about mortgage finance options for their home purchase and property eligibility requirements.” But how can lenders inform anyone when the list itself is confidential? Lenders have informed associations, Tomaselli said, but it’s unrealistic to expect them to. “The lender doesn’t have any incentive to do that,” he said. “There’s an enormous amount of time and effort that goes into analyzing the building, looking at their legal documents, insurance, budget, operations, and financials. What lender is going to spend their resources and time to do that for an association for no compensation?” Edmund Allcock, a lawyer and managing partner of Allcock Marcus in Braintree, said the secrecy hurts consumers. “To me, if you’re going to have an eligibility list, you should tell people about it,” Allcock said. “There are many developments on the list that can’t get themselves removed because they have too much commercial space or something like that. ... We’ve had people call us from all over the country, email us from all over the country, asking to find out if they’re on the list. “Clearly the federal government is protecting itself,” he said. “This is not what I would expect from the current administration. They’re supposed to be for the little guy, and this practice is not little guy-friendly. It’s inhibiting people — predominantly people with lower incomes — from being able to sell or refinance their homes without explanation.” Susan Evans is president of the condo association at Brook Village in Boxborough, which has 192 units spread over nine buildings. Fannie Mae banned the complex because of “Ground water contaminated with excessive PFAS [per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances]. Potable water cert required to remove unavailable status.” Evans said that until the Globe phoned, she didn’t know about Fannie Mae’s list or that her complex was on it. The property manager, Brad Page of Reliable Property Management, also found out about the list that way, but told the Globe he had assumed something was going on when lenders weren’t approving those loans. “We’ve had PFAS in our water for a long time, and we’re in the process of doing something about it,” Evans said. “What happened is, the state tightened up their acceptable level of PFAS. Our water hasn’t changed for years, but now we’re in violation. “Brook Village has committed to connecting to the Littleton water line project to provide residents with clean water.” Jim Morrison can be reached at JamesAndrewMorrison@gmail.com.

Why is Fannie Mae optimistic about a housing market recovery? - HousingWire,Why is Fannie Mae optimistic about a housing market recovery?

Mortgage rates, however, have been on a rising trend of late. Recent data shows that the economy is booming, while the Federal Reserve is signaling that it will take its time before cutting benchmark interest rates. HousingWire’s Mortgage Rates Center showed the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7.21% on Feb. 23. And according to Freddie Mac‘s Primary Mortgage Market Survey, the average rate inched closer to 7% this week. Fannie Mae, however, remains optimistic that housing market activity will pick up as existing home sales and new single-family housing starts are expected to grow modestly in 2024. While existing home sales dipped slightly in December by 1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.78 million units, an increase in mortgage applications and December pending home sales that led to average closing times of 30 to 45 days indicate that a modest rebound in sales is underway. With a low supply of existing homes for sale, demand for new homes is likely to remain strong, and the limit on new home sales will be determined by homebuilder production capacity, according to a report released Friday by Fannie Mae’s Economic and Strategic Research (ESR) group. “Single-family permits in contrast edged up 1.6 percent in January, back in line with the overall starts series,” the report noted. “With single-family permits and starts now back in alignment, we expect new single-family construction to continue to drift upward in coming months.” Fannie Mae forecasts total mortgage origination volume of $1.92 trillion in 2024, down slightly from $1.98 trillion in its previous forecast. Volume is expected to climb to $2.36 trillion in 2025, compared to the ESR group’s January forecast of $2.44 trillion. Softening economic growth anticipated The ESR group upgraded its 2024 macroeconomic growth outlook due to a stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter 2023 gross domestic product (GDP) report, as well as incoming data on recent population growth and immigration trends that point to faster payroll and GDP gains over the forecast horizon. Fannie Mae’s 2024 GDP outlook is for 1.7% growth in 2024, compared to 3.1% in 2023. The ESR group previously forecast a “mild recession” for 2024. “An unsustainably low savings rate suggests softer consumer spending going forward, consistent with the pullback in January retail sales, and slowing local and state tax receipts point to slower direct government spending growth,” the report stated. Further, while payroll growth looks to have reaccelerated in December and January, other labor market measurements indicate softness. The ESR group expects that the labor market “on net” is likely to cool in the near future. “Market dynamics continue to reflect significant uncertainty regarding the sustainability of stronger-than-expected recent GDP growth, the continuity of the decline of inflation, and the path of monetary policy change, not to mention the many ways in which historical relationships in housing and the larger economy remain out of balance post-pandemic,” Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae senior vice president and chief economist, said in the report.",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Home-Swap-e1693823637759.jpg,2024-02-23,-0.009,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Doug Duncan', 'description': 'American politician', 'full_name': 'Doug Duncan', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Duncan_greets_supporters%2C_September_2013.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'GDP', 'latitude': 51.582000732421875, 'longitude': 0.20630000531673431, 'location_type': 'POI'}]","Fannie Mae predicts a modest rebound in housing market activity in 2024, with existing home sales and new single-family housing starts expected to grow.

The benefit of providing more time for lender feedback was also noticed by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). President and CEO Bob Broeksmit expressed his appreciation with the agency’s move, which aligns with recommendations made by the MBA. “But there is further work Fannie Mae can undertake — including exploring a similar pilot program to Freddie Mac‘s — to improve the loan repurchase process and substantially reduce or eliminate repurchases on performing loans,” Broeksmit said. Broeksmit‘s reference is to a fee-based repurchase program for performing loans announced in November 2023 by Freddie Mac. The goal of the alternative pilot program is to improve the quality of performing loans through a potential replacement of its current repurchase policy by defective performing loans. Olson said the GSEs’ steps represent “real progress” in addressing the repurchase issue. “These developments represent a more constructive approach to the dual objectives of maintaining GSE loan quality while not disincentivizing loans for underserved borrowers or eliminating borrower loss mitigation rights under repurchase demands,” Olson said. Broeksmit added, “We will remain engaged with the GSEs and FHFA to ensure high-quality underwriting and an appropriate rep and warranty framework.” In October, FHFA Director Sandra Thompson said the regulator expects originators to deliver loans consistent with GSE guidelines. But she added that the enterprises must implement a fair, consistent and predictable process for identifying loan defects and the appropriate remedies. “After multiple years of record-high loan volume, we have seen an increase in the absolute number of repurchase requests — which is to be expected,” Thompson said at the MBA Annual conference in October 2023. “The good news is that there has been a large decrease in repurchase requests since their peak in early 2022, as the enterprises have worked through loans originated during the refinance boom.”",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HousingWire-Fannie-Mae-Office.jpg,2024-03-01,-0.211,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CHLA', 'latitude': 45.549720764160156, 'longitude': 41.96305847167969, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Olson', 'latitude': 36.25891876220703, 'longitude': -104.08135986328125, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MBA', 'latitude': -1.6971800327301025, 'longitude': 37.618080139160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'President', 'latitude': 39.00777816772461, 'longitude': -88.85791778564453, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Thompson', 'latitude': 47.773590087890625, 'longitude': -97.10980224609375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae has implemented a new quality control process that allows mortgage lenders to address loan defect concerns earlier, potentially reducing costly repurchase demands.

The $77.4 billion figure marks a sharp increase from prior years — $60.3 billion in 2022 and $47.4 billion in 2021. In the fourth quarter of last year, specifically, the GSE reported $3.9 billion in net income, which was “primarily driven by a $7.9 billion shift to a benefit for credit losses in 2023 from provision for credit losses in 2022,” according to the report. Net interest income was strong for the year, the GSE reported, and was primarily driven by guaranty fee income. “While the company’s base guaranty fee income grew slightly in 2023, higher interest rates during the year drove a decline in deferred guaranty fee income due to lower refinance activity,” the report stated. “This was offset by an increase in income due to higher yields on securities in the company’s corporate liquidity portfolio.” Single-family conventional loan acquisition volume fell from $614.8 billion in 2022 to $316 billion in 2023, while purchase acquisition volume dropped from $378 billion to $272.8 billion during the same period. More than 45% of the acquisition volume came from first-time homebuyers, the company reported. “The fourth quarter capped another successful year,” Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar said in an accompanying statement. “Fannie Mae reported $3.9 billion in net income, marking our twenty-fourth consecutive quarter of positive earnings. In 2023, we delivered $17.4 billion in earnings and continued to rebuild our capital and further strengthen our financial stability.” The year for housing was challenging primarily due to elevated mortgage rates, limited inventory available to homebuyers and affordability challenges reflected in high prices. Still, Fannie Mae managed to see positive results from its programs, Almodovar said. “Against [a challenging] backdrop, we provided $369 billion in liquidity, helping 1.5 million households buy, refinance, or rent a home,” Almodovar said. “As we close on our 85th year supporting America’s housing system, we remain committed to effectively managing risks and being a reliable source of mortgage credit for America’s homeowners and renters.”",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HousingWire-Fannie-Mae-Office.jpg,2024-02-15,-0.18,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Almodovar', 'latitude': 40.3838996887207, 'longitude': -3.5955801010131836, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]","Fannie Mae reported a net worth of $77.4 billion in 2023, up from $60.3 billion in 2022.

Previously, the information was available only to lenders, who were sent a spreadsheet with the header: “Fannie Mae Confidential and Proprietary — Subject to Non-Disclosure Obligations.” A Fannie Mae spokesperson wrote in an email: • “Fannie Mae will implement a web-based tool later in 2024 for condo homeowners’ associations that provides HOAs the ability to determine if loans secured by the project are ineligible for sale to Fannie Mae and to understand the reason why they may not meet one or more of our published requirements. (Fannie Mae’s website says it will make the information available in the third quarter.) • More information on how HOAs can access and use the tool will be posted on our HOA-facing webpage closer to the time the tool is available for use.” The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, popularly known as “Freddie Mac,” announced something very similar on Wednesday. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy home mortgages, package them, and sell them to investors, making it possible for borrowers in low-income brackets with lower credit scores and little saved for a down payment to get loans. The Federal Housing Finance Agency oversees it all. Together, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac support 70 percent of the mortgage market, according to the National Association of Realtors. If people want to buy properties that Fannie Mae won’t touch, they have to search elsewhere for a loan, which could ratchet up costs for some of the most vulnerable people in the housing market. According to data obtained by the Globe, there were 1,770 developments in the United States on the list in May. By August, there were 2,001. As of October, there were 2,306. Thirty-seven of them were in Massachusetts, 1.6 percent of that list. Florida had the most (34.5 percent), followed by California (10.3 percent) and South Carolina (4.6 percent). The other New England states had fewer blacklisted properties than Massachusetts: Condominium developments present different risks to mortgage lenders than single-family homes. If a development includes a commercial component, not enough of the units are owner-occupied, the development is involved in litigation, or there are a lot of unit owners in arrears on fees, Fannie Mae may add it to the list. Attorney Ed Allcock of Allcock Marcus said he is glad that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are becoming more transparent. “I am glad that both Fannie and Freddie are now directly providing the same exact service that Allcock & Marcus has been providing to homeowners all over the country since we learned of and obtained the blacklist,” he said. “I would hope that they would make the list generally available to the public, but this is a start. I am also hopeful that the implementation of an appeal process would allow for easier interaction between the federal government and condominiums trying to understand why they are on the list and how they can get off.” Jim Morrison can be reached at [email protected].",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OONUTZ42NJAO3C2TIJWOP5P7ME-65722a58e7894-768x432.jpeg,2023-12-07,-0.252,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Jim Morrison', 'description': 'Australian physical chemist', 'full_name': 'Jim Morrison'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Globe', 'latitude': 0.0, 'longitude': 0.0, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 39.58396911621094, 'longitude': -80.03756713867188, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HOAs', 'latitude': -27.200000762939453, 'longitude': 18.2833309173584, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HOA', 'latitude': -5.733329772949219, 'longitude': 132.5500030517578, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'latitude': 42.36565017700195, 'longitude': -71.10832214355469, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Florida', 'latitude': 28.750539779663086, 'longitude': -82.5000991821289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'South Carolina', 'latitude': 34.000431060791016, 'longitude': -81.00009155273438, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New England', 'latitude': 39.206939697265625, 'longitude': -81.70861053466797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Marcus', 'latitude': 42.15835189819336, 'longitude': -90.19596099853516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae, a mortgage purchasing giant, will make its secret ""Condo Unavailable Projects and Phases Report"" public later in 2024.

The mortgage giant&apos;s January Home Purchase Sentiment Index® (HPSI) increased 3.5 points to 70.7, its highest level since March 2022. The improvement comes as many Americans feel the U.S. economy has turned a corner. The number of consumers stating they were not worried about losing their jobs over the next 12 months increased to 82% in January, up from 75% the previous month. Moreover, 36% of respondents said they expect mortgage rates to keep dropping this year. Mortgage rates have fallen by more than a percentage point since late October, and Fannie Mae anticipates they could increase to 6% if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates this year. Despite the improved sentiment over mortgage rates, the outlook on housing remains dim, with only 17% of respondents believing that now is a good time to buy a home. ""For the first time in our National Housing Survey&apos;s history, a greater share of consumers believe mortgage rates will decrease over the next year, rather than increase,"" Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist Doug Duncan said. ""Consumers also expressed greater confidence in their job situations this month, another sign that housing sentiment may continue to improve in 2024. ""However, while home affordability may improve if actual mortgage rates continue moving downward, other parts of the affordability equation have yet to ease or improve for consumers,"" Duncan continued. Homebuyers can find the best mortgage rate by shopping around and comparing options. You can visit an online marketplace like Credible to compare rates, choose your loan term and get preapproved with multiple lenders at once. BUY A HOME IN THESE STATES TO GET STUDENT LOAN DEBT RELIEF The number of respondents who expect home prices to rise dropped slightly to 37% in January from 39% the previous month. However, only 22% of respondents believe prices will decrease, down from 24%. U.S. home prices climbed 0.4% month over month in December, the smallest increase since June, according to the Redfin Home Price Index (RHPI). In January, the typical home in the U.S. was $344,000 with a monthly mortgage payment, assuming 20% down, of $1,790, according to Zillow. There&apos;s little chance that home prices will drop meaningfully this year since many existing homeowners are locked into below 4% mortgage rates. That means the market is likely to remain competitive for what supply does come to market, and home prices will continue to strengthen, even as mortgage rates decline. ""A large majority still think home prices will either increase or stay the same; the &apos;good time to buy&apos; component continues to hover near its historical low; and fewer than one-in-five respondents indicated that their household income was significantly higher year over year, matching a survey low,"" Duncan said. ""All in all, while a lower mortgage rate path supports our forecast for a gradual increase in housing demand and sales activity in 2024, until we see a meaningful increase in housing supply, we expect affordability will remain a significant barrier to homeownership for many households."" If you are looking to take advantage of the current mortgage rates by refinancing your mortgage loan or are ready to shop for the best rate on a new mortgage, consider visiting an online marketplace like Credible to compare rates and get preapproved with multiple lenders at once. MANY AMERICANS PREPARING FOR A RECESSION DESPITE SIGNS THAT SAY OTHERWISE: SURVEY There&apos;s little indication that rates will drop lower in time for the spring home buying season. The Federal Reserve is holding steady on interest rates while announcing last week that it would leave the federal funds rate at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%. Meanwhile, the January employment situation report showed a strong reading, and the economy grew again in the fourth quarter of 2023 to beat expectations. The Fed still envisions several interest rate cuts this year but has yet to set a timeline for how soon or far it will go. Fed officials have predicted at least three rate cuts this year, with interest rates expected to tick down to 4.6%, according to the central bank&apos;s updated economic forecasts in its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). Fannie Mae has based its forecast that mortgage rates will drop below 6% by the end of 2024 on the Fed moving faster than anticipated on interest rate reductions. How soon cuts will come depends on how fast inflation returns close to that 2% target rate or if the Fed senses that the U.S. economy is headed into a recession.

Established in 1938 during the Great Depression as part of the New Deal, Fannie Mae helps low- to moderate-income borrowers obtain financing for a home. What Fannie Mae Does As a secondary mortgage market participant, Fannie Mae does not originate mortgage loans. Instead, it keeps funds flowing to lenders by purchasing or guaranteeing mortgages issued by credit unions, banks, thrifts, and other financial institutions. By investing in the mortgage market, Fannie Mae creates liquidity for lenders, allowing them to underwrite or fund additional mortgages. In 2022, Fannie Mae provided $684 billion in liquidity to the mortgage market. It is one of two large purchasers of mortgages in the secondary market. The other is its sibling Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, also a GSE chartered by Congress.After purchasing mortgages on the secondary market, Fannie Mae pools them to form a mortgage-backed security (MBS). An MBS is an asset-backed security secured by a mortgage or pool of mortgages. Fannie Mae’s mortgage-backed securities are purchased by institutions, such as insurance companies, pension funds, and investment banks. It guarantees payments of principal and interest on its MBSs.Fannie Mae also has a retained portfolio, which invests in its own and other institutions’ mortgage-backed securities. Fannie Mae issues debt, called agency debt, to fund its retained portfolio. History of Fannie Mae Stock Fannie Mae has been publicly traded since 1968. Until 2010, it traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Following the Great Recession and its impact on the housing market, Fannie Mae was forced to delist its shares for failure to meet the minimum closing price requirement mandated by the NYSE. Fannie Mae now trades over the counter. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac went under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).In September 2019, the Treasury and FHFA allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to keep their earnings to shore up their capital reserves as a step toward transitioning the two out of conservatorship. Fannie Mae Loan Requirements The mortgages that Fannie Mae purchases and guarantees must meet strict criteria. The limit, set by the FHFA, for a conventional loan for a single-family home in 2023 is $726,200 for most areas and $1,089,300 for high-cost areas, including Hawaii and Alaska. Approved lenders must meet eligibility and underwriting criteria that ensure the credit quality of the financing and comply with the Statement on Subprime Lending issued by the federal government, which addresses risks associated with subprime loans, such as variable rates, limits on interest rate increases, borrower income documentation, and product features that make frequent refinancing of the loan likely. How to Apply for a Fannie Mae-Backed Mortgage Borrowers complete a Uniform Residential Loan Application and gather and provide financial information and documentation. This includes employment and gross income and statements, such as a W-2 or 1099. Applicants provide monthly debt obligations, such as balances on credit cards, car payments, alimony, and child support. Generally, lenders prefer to follow the 28/36 Rule meaning a household should spend no more than 28% of monthly income on housing expenses and no more than 36% on debt servicing in mortgages and car loans. Fannie Mae will accept a maximum debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of 36% but can be as high as 45% if the borrower meets credit score and reserve requirements. If the DTI ratio is too high, borrowers can make a larger down payment, reducing monthly costs. While a 20% down payment is considered ideal, some borrowers may be able to put as little as 3% down.Homebuyers must also meet minimum credit requirements for Fannie Mae-backed mortgages. For a single-family home that is a primary residence, a FICO score of at least 620 for fixed-rate loans and 640 for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) is required. Loan Modifications and Fannie Mae HomePath Loan modifications change the conditions of an existing mortgage to help borrowers avoid default, ending up in foreclosure, and ultimately losing their homes. Modifications can include a lower interest rate and extending the loan term, which would lower monthly payments. When foreclosures arise on mortgages in which Fannie Mae is the owner or investor, or when properties are acquired through deeds instead of foreclosure or forfeiture, Fannie Mae attempts to sell the properties promptly to minimize potential impacts on the community. HomePath by Fannie Mae is where home buyers and investors can search for and make offers on these properties. The HomePath program is a way for creditworthy homebuyers to finance new homes. In some cases, special financing may be available. These include closing cost assistance, 3% down payments, and improvement costs bundled into the loan.HomePath.com advertises properties owned by Fannie Mae, including single-family homes, townhouses, and condominiums. Fannie Mae uses local real estate professionals to prepare, maintain, and list the properties for sale. Fannie Mae’s RefiNow Program Fannie Mae offers low-income mortgage holders a refinance option through a program called RefiNow, meant to reduce monthly payments and interest rates. To be eligible, homeowners must be earning at or below 100% of their area median income (AMI). “Lower-income borrowers typically refinance at a slower pace than higher-income borrowers, potentially missing an opportunity to save on housing costs,” says Malloy Evans, executive vice president of single-family business at Fannie Mae. If homeowners are unsure about whether or not Fannie Mae owns their mortgage, they can visit Fannie Mae’s Loan Lookup Tool. The RefiNow program requires a reduction in the homeowner’s interest rate by a minimum of 50 basis points and savings of at least $50 in the homeowner’s monthly mortgage payment. Fannie Mae provides a $500 credit to the lender at the time that the loan is purchased if an appraisal was obtained for the transaction, and this credit must be passed on from the lender to the homeowner. To qualify for RefiNow, a homeowner must meet these qualifications: Have a Fannie Mae-backed mortgage secured by a one-unit principal residence.Have a current income at or below 100% of the AMI.Consistently paid the mortgage payment in the past six months with no more than one missed mortgage payment in the past 12 months.Have a mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 97% and a debt-to-income ratio of 65% or less. The Bottom Line Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored entity that buys mortgages that meet standard criteria. By investing in mortgages, Fannie Mae creates liquidity for lenders, including banks, thrifts, and credit unions. Fannie Mae frees up cash for local and national banks to continue extending mortgages.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/EvybMO7BKSKlBS5cM3ZTprrKptQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-131966314-a259153a4b1e46a7a26fa5e523ce36dd.jpg,2017-01-23,-0.068,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 39.58388900756836, 'longitude': -80.0374984741211, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Congress', 'latitude': 40.9258918762207, 'longitude': -82.05293273925781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Deal', 'latitude': 33.737308502197266, 'longitude': -101.83656311035156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York Stock Exchange', 'latitude': 40.70677185058594, 'longitude': -74.0112533569336, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NYSE', 'latitude': 1.065369963645935, 'longitude': 13.047080039978027, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hawaii', 'latitude': 20.750280380249023, 'longitude': -156.50027465820312, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Alaska', 'latitude': 64.00028228759766, 'longitude': -150.00027465820312, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Rule', 'latitude': 33.18305969238281, 'longitude': -99.8933334350586, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'FICO', 'latitude': 4.298900127410889, 'longitude': 9.717599868774414, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'AMI', 'latitude': -6.233329772949219, 'longitude': 150.2166748046875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored enterprise, purchases and guarantees mortgages, providing liquidity to lenders and stimulating homeownership.

Together, CIRT 2024-L2 and CIRT 2024-H1 transferred $709.0 million of mortgage credit risk to private insurers and reinsurers. ""We appreciate the support of the 25 insurers and reinsurers that committed to write coverage on these deals,"" said Rob Schaefer, Fannie Mae Vice President, Capital Markets. The covered loan pool for CIRT 2024-L2 consists of approximately 30,000 single-family mortgage loans with an outstanding unpaid principal balance (UPB) of approximately $9.9 billion. Additionally, the covered pool collateral has loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of 60.01 percent to 80.00 percent and was acquired between April 2023 and July 2023. The covered loan pool for CIRT 2024-H1 consists of approximately 35,000 single-family mortgage loans with an outstanding UPB of approximately $12.1 billion. This covered pool collateral has LTV ratios of 80.01 percent to 97.00 percent and was acquired between January 2023 and May 2023. The loans included in both transactions are fixed-rate, generally 30-year term, fully amortizing mortgages and were underwritten using rigorous credit standards and enhanced risk controls. With CIRT 2024-L2, which became effective February 1, 2024, Fannie Mae will retain risk for the first 160 basis points of loss on the $9.9 billion covered loan pool. If the $158.3 million retention layer is exhausted, 25 insurers and reinsurers will cover the next 410 basis points of loss on the pool, up to a maximum coverage of $405.7 million. With CIRT 2024-H1, which also became effective February 1, 2024, Fannie Mae will retain risk for the first 175 basis points of loss on the $12.1 billion covered loan pool. If the $212.3 million retention layer is exhausted, 23 insurers and reinsurers will cover the next 250 basis points of loss on the pool, up to a maximum coverage of $303.4 million. Coverage for these deals is provided based upon actual losses for a term of 18 years. Depending on the paydown of the insured pools and the principal amounts of insured loans that become seriously delinquent, the coverage amounts may be reduced at the one-year anniversary and each month thereafter. The coverage on these deals may be canceled by Fannie Mae at any time on or after the five-year anniversary of the effective date by paying a cancellation fee. Since inception to date, Fannie Mae has acquired approximately $26.9 billion of insurance coverage on $901.2 billion of single-family loans through the CIRT program, measured at the time of issuance for both post-acquisition (bulk) and front-end transactions. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $1.29 trillion in outstanding UPB of loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business were included in a reference pool for a credit risk transfer transaction. To promote transparency and to help insurers and reinsurers evaluate the CIRT program, Fannie Mae provides ongoing, robust disclosure data, as well as access to news, resources, and analytics through its credit risk transfer webpages. This includes Fannie Mae's innovative Data Dynamics® tool that enables market participants to interact with and analyze both CIRT deals that are currently outstanding in the market and Fannie Mae's historical loan dataset.

The Single-Family business has been recognized as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year annually since the launch of its Single-Family Green MBS program in 2020. ENERGY STAR certification requirements are the baseline of the program, in which Fannie Mae provides green financing for loans backed by properties that achieve at a minimum 10% more energy efficiencies than residential properties built to state energy code. ""Our Single-Family Green MBS program demonstrates our commitment to achieving positive outcomes by financing single-family homes that exceed energy-standards,"" said Arthur Johnson, Vice President, Capital Markets, Fannie Mae. ""We continue to increase partnerships with lenders, builders, and energy raters to help encourage more ENERGY STAR certified homes."" Since 1992, ENERGY STAR and its partners helped families and businesses in America avoid more than $500 billion in energy costs and achieve more than 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas reductions.

Not only that, but rates will not fall below 6% in 2025, according to the government-sponsored enterprise's forecast. ""Hotter-than-expected inflation data and strong payroll numbers are likely to apply more upward pressure to mortgage rates this year than we'd previously forecast, as markets continue to evolve their expectations of future monetary policy,"" Chief Economist Doug Duncan said in a press release. ""Still, while we don't expect a dramatic surge in the supply of homes for sale, we do anticipate an increase in the level of market transactions relative to 2023 — even if mortgage rates remain elevated."" Those factors have the market now expecting the Federal Open Market Committee, meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, to hold off on any short-term rate reductions until later this year. That in turn is impacting the 10-year Treasury yield, which led Duncan to raise his fourth quarter 2024 rate forecast to 6.4% from 5.9%. For the same period next year, he now sees rates at 6%, versus 5.7%. The 10-year yield was at 4.31% at noon on March 19; the yield was as low as 3.82% on Feb. 1. Duncan reduced his 2024 originations outlook to $1.76 trillion from $1.91 trillion in the February forecast, with originations reduced to $1.37 trillion from $1.46 trillion. Refinance volume is now expected to come in at $397 billion from $459 billion. Fannie Mae estimated that total volume in 2023 was $1.47 trillion, with $1.22 trillion coming from home purchase originations. In 2025, Fannie Mae now expects $2.18 trillion of volume, versus $2.36 trillion one month ago. Separately, mortgage applications for newly constructed homes increased 15.7% year-over-year and by 1% month-to-month in February, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. The numbers from its Builder Application Survey are not seasonally adjusted. Rising rates actually hampered activity during the month, but a competitive market kept volume up, said Joel Kan, deputy chief economist, in a press release. ""The average loan size increased to its highest level since March 2023 at almost $406,000, but it was still below the record high in MBA's survey of more than $436,000 in April 2022,"" said Kan. ""The Federal Housing Administration share of purchase applications, which provides a read on first-time homebuyer activity, increased to 25.7%, indicating that first-time buyers continue to turn to new homes due to the lack of affordable existing home options."" New single-family home sales were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 689,000 units, down 1.6% from January's pace of 700,000 units. Unadjusted, an estimated 62,000 new home sales occurred in February, down 1.6% from 63,000 the prior month. Besides the FHA share at 25.7%, conventional loans made up 63.9% of the volume, Department of Veterans Affairs comprised 10.1%, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture program just 0.3%. Meanwhile, the FHA made it official — boosting the loan limits for Title 1 manufactured housing mortgages. This is the first increase in 15 years, but it won't be the last, as the agency promised to recalculate the limits annually to keep pace with home price changes. Starting March 29, the limits are $105,532 for a single-section manufactured home and $193,719 for a multisection dwelling. The lot loan limit is $43,377. ""Updating the Title I loan limits was the next critical piece in our ongoing efforts to make the Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program work for lenders and homebuyers for whom manufactured housing offers an affordable way to meet their housing needs,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon in a press release. ""We hope these changes will prompt more lenders to consider using the Title I program to meet the financing needs of consumers purchasing or refinancing manufactured homes."" Manufactured housing is seen by advocates as a tool to relieve the inventory shortage. That shortage has kept home prices elevated. But the February report from First American Data & Analytics found that while prices increased 6.3% year-over-year, it was the slowest annual pace since October 2023. The increase from January was 0.7%. The second consecutive decline in the monthly pace clarifies the trajectory for price movements, First American Chief Economist Mark Fleming said. ""In February, our preliminary estimate of annualized appreciation dropped by almost a full percentage point,"" Fleming said in a press release. ""The last time there was a slow-down of this magnitude was in early 2023 when the Fed was aggressively raising interest rates."" While indications are that the supply of homes for sale is on the rise, inflation is keeping prices elevated, he said. Still, ""the relative increase in homes for sale is a welcome sign for prospective home buyers and seems to be helping to normalize house-price appreciation, an added benefit heading into the spring home-buying season,"" Fleming said.

The Fannie Mae Economic and Strategic Research Group recently released its March 2024 commentary. The organization now expects the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to end the year at 6.4 percent, up from the 5.9 percent predicted in last month’s forecast. “Strong headline jobs numbers and hotter-than-expected inflation data had led financial markets to price in a less aggressive rate-cutting path by the Federal Reserve, and while the ESR Group notes that labor market indicators are mixed and disinflation will likely resume, it also believes that recent data are unlikely to provide the Fed with the ‘greater confidence’ it needs to begin easing monetary policy in the near term,” the report said. But the Fannie Mae ESR Group noted it expects existing home sales will trend upward in 2024 due in part to increased activity by households likely needing to move due to life events – and who are thus less sensitive to the interest rate lock-in effect. The ESR Group cited the recent trend upward in new home listings as well as comparative strength in the latest reading of the ‘good time to sell’ component of the Fannie Mae Home Purchase Sentiment Index as evidence that housing market activity is likely to continue its gradual thaw in the months and quarters ahead. “The housing market is likely to continue to face the dual affordability constraints of high home prices and elevated interest rates in 2024,” said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae senior vice president and chief economist. “Hotter-than-expected inflation data and strong payroll numbers are likely to apply more upward pressure to mortgage rates this year than we’d previously forecast, as markets continue to evolve their expectations of future monetary policy.” Duncan noted he does not expect a dramatic surge in the supply of homes for sale but does anticipate an increase in the level of market transactions compared to last year, “even if mortgage rates remain elevated.”",https://newslink.mba.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fannie-Mae-Sentiment-3-20-24-650.png?w=650,2024-03-22,-0.036,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Doug Duncan', 'description': 'American politician', 'full_name': 'Doug Duncan', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Duncan_greets_supporters%2C_September_2013.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 38.895111083984375, 'longitude': -77.03636932373047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'D.C.', 'latitude': 38.91706085205078, 'longitude': -77.00025177001953, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Duncan', 'latitude': 32.721458435058594, 'longitude': -109.10533905029297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae predicts a 6.4% 30-year fixed mortgage rate by year-end, leading to a modest downgrade in home sales and mortgage originations.

Earlier Thursday, the NAR said sales of existing homes, the majority of purchases, surged 9.5% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.38 million. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had estimated sales of previously owned homes to fall 1.3% in February. The monthly increase marked the first time in more than two years that sales increased for two consecutive months. The forward momentum in sales over the last two months comes just ahead of the spring selling season and follows one of the most sluggish periods for the housing market in recent history. Home sales in 2023 fell to the lowest levels in nearly 30 years. Since 2022, higher mortgage rates, high home prices and limited inventory have stifled sales, which were still down 3.3% from a year earlier in February.

Mixed Data Muddles Macroeconomic Forecast - Fannie Mae,Mixed Data Muddles Macroeconomic Forecast  Fannie Mae,"Mon, 26 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhbm5pZW1hZS5jb20vcmVzZWFyY2gtYW5kLWluc2lnaHRzL2ZvcmVjYXN0L21peGVkLWRhdGEtbXVkZGxlcy1tYWNyb2Vjb25vbWljLWZvcmVjYXN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fannie Mae,"While much of the economic data in recent months paints a mixed picture of the economy, the ongoing resilience in employment, strong housing demand, and current financial conditions do not point to an immediate downturn. We have therefore upgraded our 2023 GDP forecast to 0.1 percent from negative 0.3 percent on a Q4/Q4 basis, while also downgrading our 2024 forecast by a similar magnitude (0.8 percent from 1.2 percent). This reflects a shift in the start to our forecasted modest recession to the fourth quarter of 2023. Timing the business cycle is difficult, therefore there are substantive risks to our inflation, interest rate, employment, and housing forecasts. However, fundamentally, we still see an economy in its late-cycle stage. While households are not overly leveraged by historical standards, the current pace of consumer spending remains unsustainable given current income levels and, to date, has been supported by drawing down pandemic-related savings and tapping into increasing debt. Since January 2020, real personal consumption is up 8.5 percent, while real disposable personal income is up only 2.7 percent. This divergence will need to converge, creating downward pressure on consumer spending growth relative to that of income. We expect the continued tightening of credit conditions, slowing bank lending, and shrinking money supply will eventually lead to a downward turn in business investment and hiring, eventually leading consumers to pull back on spending, coinciding with a recession. Headline inflation is decelerating fast, in part due to large annual declines in energy prices that we believe largely reflect softening global economic growth. As measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the annual pace of inflation decelerated to 4.0 percent in May, down from 4.9 percent in April. It is expected to fall further in coming months to a little over 3 percent. Core inflation is comparatively persistent, falling more gradually to only 5.3 percent in May, but this too is forecast to decelerate to around 4 percent by the end of 2023. Housing activity continues to be shaped by the lack of inventory available for sale. Prices have firmed in recent months after softening over the second half of last year, and new home construction has taken the place of some missing existing inventory. Our home sales forecast is essentially unchanged this month; we expect sales in 2023 and 2024 to total 4.86 million and 4.97 million units, respectively. However, following the most recent blowout housing starts report (released following the completion of our forecast) there is substantial upside risk to our near-term new home sales and starts outlook. We project total single-family mortgage originations for 2023 to be $1.59 trillion, down from our previous forecast of $1.65 trillion. For 2024, we anticipate total single-family origination volumes of $1.90 trillion, compared to our prior forecast of $2.03 trillion. A Murky View of the Economy The annualized growth rate for real gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged 1.9 percent over the past two quarters, indicating the economy is generally growing at a solid pace. However, the same recent release that upwardly revised the first quarter estimate of GDP to 1.3 percent from 1.1 percent, also reported that gross domestic income (GDI) declined at a 2.3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. In theory, GDP and GDI should equal one another, but they can diverge due to measurement differences. We suspect that the underlying trend is closer to the average of these metrics, which points to stalling economic growth. Other economic data, such as faltering manufacturing output in the industrial production reports, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and regional manufacturing surveys, continue to trend downward, and generally lackluster retail sales since January supports the notion that demand has cooled and the economy is poised to slip into a recession. In contrast, housing construction remains robust, and strength in manufacturing construction and ongoing recovery in auto production are helping to offset weakness in broader commercial real estate and goods manufacturing. Corporate profits have also been stronger than expected and equity markets have rallied. Nonfarm payroll employment growth continues to be robust and accelerated in both April and May, reaching job gains of 339,000 in the latter. But this same report also showed the unemployment rate rising three-tenths to 3.7 percent. While still at a low level, new unemployment claims have also trended upward in recent weeks. One way of measuring the labor market as a whole is a composite index published by the Kansas City Fed Bank that aims to capture labor market conditions holistically, and this measure points to a labor market that remains strong in absolute levels but is gradually turning. Taken together, we see the economy remaining more resilient than we expected earlier in the year, but it is still on a decelerating path and additional drags are likely forthcoming. The full effects of tighter monetary policy and credit standards to date have yet to be fully felt in the real economy, and additional banking stress remains a possibility. The resumption of student loan repayments is also expected to drag on consumer spending in the second half of 2023. While the exact magnitude of the repayments is difficult to assess due to various income-based repayment plans, we expect that aggregate payments are in the range of 0.3 to 0.4 percent of nominal personal income. Inflation to Slow Further, but Rebound Risks Remain Headline CPI was below 5 percent on a year-over-year basis for the first time in two years in April, and then decelerated even further in May to 4 percent. Barring an unexpected energy or commodity price shock, we expect CPI will continue to decelerate through the rest of the year. This is due in part to favorable base effects because price growth in most CPI components was considerably stronger a year ago than it is currently (particularly in energy), which will cause the year-over-year CPI readings to decelerate. Additionally, shelter inflation, which comprises more than a third of the CPI and reflects housing and rental price growth with a significant lag, will begin to reflect more timely measures of market rent growth. Though core inflationary pressures have been stickier, we think these, too, will cool. First, shelter inflation has an even larger impact on core CPI. Second, supply chain measures have improved greatly, and business input price growth has cooled considerably, as reflected in the producer price index and the ISM prices paid surveys. This will put downward pressure on consumer prices, particularly in goods. Finally, wage growth is likely to cool as well. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) quits rate, which, is highly correlated with wage growth, has steadily declined to just above its pre-pandemic level in April, suggesting wage-related inflationary pressures may soon return to pre-pandemic levels. Unit labor costs, a measure of the price of an hour of labor output, were revised downward for the past two quarters in the most recent release. While underlying improvements in inflation dynamics are encouraging, as previously mentioned, continued deceleration is in part a function of economic activity slowing and expectations of a coming recession. If a recession is avoided over the coming quarters, this risks an entrenchment of current labor-market-related core inflationary pressure. Energy prices are also currently suppressed in part due to global growth concerns; if the economy proves to be more robust than expected, oil prices could rebound, reanimating topline inflation as well as consumer inflation expectations. Additionally, home price growth, on a monthly basis, returned to positive territory recently due to a mix of tighter inventories and somewhat lower mortgage rates, which highlights a risk that shelter could reinflate. One of the historical lessons of the 1970-80s inflationary era was that inflation can easily come roaring back if monetary policy easing begins prematurely. The current situation differs greatly from that era, however; we suspect that the Fed’s most recent guidance of 50 basis points more of rate hikes following the June pause was intended to guide financial markets such that intermediate- and longer-term interest rates do not start falling on future rate cut expectations. Until there is strong evidence of core inflation being contained, the worry of reaccelerating inflation via too-early policy easing will remain present. Our baseline expectation is that the Fed will keep monetary policy tighter until core inflation is clearly subdued, which is not likely to occur until there is clear evidence of labor market softening. By the time that happens a recession will have likely been set in motion. We therefore see the Fed’s decision regarding how high and long to keep rates as a major risk over the next year, with the question of a downturn more a matter of “when” than “if”. Improvement in For-Sale Home Inventories Was Short-Lived For much of 2022, existing home sales slowed in response to mortgage rates that rose toward 7 percent. While the flow of new listings remained suppressed, the slower pace of sales led to a build-up of active inventories for sale and a modest decline in national house prices in late 2022. Though still at a low level, the active for-sale inventory of listings, according to Redfin, was up 29 percent on an annual basis at the end of January. However, as the spring homebuying season took off, housing demand has proven surprisingly resilient despite historically stretched affordability constraints and active listings have not grown in the usual seasonal pattern. According to the same Redfin data, active listings for the week ending June 13 were down around 6 percent from a year prior. The housing market continues to have an extremely limited supply of homes for sale, in part because of the ongoing lock-in effect, in which existing owners are disincentivized to list their homes due to not wanting to give up a mortgage rate much lower than current market rates. Tight inventories are causing a slow pace of existing home sales, while also reanimating house price growth and demand for new homes. House price growth on an annualized basis grew around 8 percent in February and March, according to FHFA’s monthly Purchase-Only Index, and over 4 percent according to the Case-Shiller Index, the latter of which, amongst other differences, includes jumbo loan-financed properties. The lack of existing homes for sale and firming house price growth is helping to support new construction. Single-family housing starts exploded in May by 18.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of 997,000 units. We believe that some of this jump is likely statistical noise in a notoriously volatile series and will likely pull back or be revised going forward. Single-family housing permits, which tend to be more indicative of the underlying trend, also rose, but by a smaller 4.8 percent and to a SAAR of 897,000 units, well below the pace of starts. Still, the permits data points to a clear upward trend in recent months, and this coincides with improvement in homebuilder sentiment. We expect starts to soften somewhat in coming quarters. However, this outlook is predicated on the business cycle turning. Without a broader economic slowdown, current home prices and lack of existing inventories will lead to more home construction. There have been huge swings in the relationship between single-family housing starts and completions since the outbreak of the pandemic, where a surge in homebuyer demand and ongoing supply chain issues created major disruptions. However, typically the relationship between the two is similar, because when home builders complete one project they can then move on to a new one. Based on the pace of single-family housing completions, which we read as a better indicator of the construction industry’s current capacity, the single-family starts pace could indeed converge to around 1 million annualized units over the coming months, after backlog issues are cleared. This is to say that in the absence of a recessionary environment there is substantial upside risk to our new home sales and starts forecasts. Multifamily housing starts also moved higher in May, to a SAAR of 634,000 units, the highest since 1986. We generally have a less bullish view on multifamily starts in the near term as vacancy rates are now near a more typical pre-pandemic level, rent growth is slowing, and construction loan credit conditions are tightening. Additionally, there is now a record number of units currently under construction and this will add additional supply to many markets. While the May 2023 report points to upside risk to our near-term forecast, we anticipate multifamily starts to slow meaningfully in coming quarters. Mortgage Originations We forecast single-family purchase mortgage originations to be $1.32 trillion in 2023 and $1.41 trillion in 2024, representing downward revisions of $41 billion and $60 billion, respectively, relative to last month’s forecast. As revisions to the home sales forecast were relatively minor this month, the bulk of this month’s revisions were due to recent incoming data on the share of transactions financed by cash, which has been trending upward lately. In a high-rate environment, it makes economic sense for some prospective homebuyers to avoid taking out a mortgage altogether. For refinance originations, we have revised down projected 2023 and 2024 volumes by $21 billion and $65 billion, respectively. The downward revision can be attributed to continued low refinance application volumes measured by our Refinance Application-Level Index (RALI) and a higher expected rate environment in this month’s forecast.

That means a first year that sets you up to navigate corporate life successfully and discover a career path that’s a good fit. When Taylor joined Fannie Mae in 2013 with a B.S. in finance, she was delighted that the company’s First Year Forward program was designed to help new associates explore and thrive. First Year Forward jumpstarts careers Fannie Mae’s First Year Forward is a 12-month development program that immerses associates in company culture and expands their knowledge of Fannie Mae and the housing industry. It’s an excellent opportunity to build a professional network, sharpen skills not taught in school, and, in some cases, access growth opportunities outside of your immediate role. “Joining Fannie Mae as a first-year associate was a perfect fit,” Taylor explains. “I was able to learn what I wanted out of a job. I also joined the company with a cohort of other recent graduates, which gave me an immediate group of peers and friends.” Taylor had the ability to experience varied job roles in her first year, which is only possible in finance. This helped guide the long-term path for her career. “In Multifamily, I found a group that let me use my analytical and finance skills but also pushed me to become more customer-service focused. After several years on the Customer Engagement team, I had an opportunity to move to credit underwriting, which allowed me to broaden my skillset while still getting to work with our lender partners and other production teams.” More than a career — benefits with life-changing impact Many of Fannie Mae’s life-encompassing employee benefits start the first day of work and promote health, finances, career, work-life fit, and community. “One of my favorite benefits is time off for volunteer service,” Taylor explains. “Fannie Mae organizes and offers opportunities for volunteer work, making it easy to participate. I was able to go to Puerto Rico to help rebuild homes destroyed by hurricanes. Getting to work with people from other parts of the organization and to give back in such a way makes Fannie Mae a unique and great place to work.” Taylor’s volunteer team built a whole new kitchen and bathroom in just a few days. “We significantly improved the quality of life for a very deserving family. That is an experience I will never forget.” The flexibility of hybrid work Work-life balance is of top importance for many people. At first, Taylor worked in the Washington, D.C., office but was able to work remotely even before the pandemic. She says, “As a result of Fannie Mae’s flexibility, my spouse and I could move close to family, which I am so grateful for. I work with people all over the country, and Fannie Mae’s investment in technology and our ability to collaborate via Teams makes me feel very connected. My group also has opportunities for in-person collaboration and socializing with my amazing coworkers.” Ready to learn more? With so many interesting roles and the First Year Forward program to help launch careers that make an impact, Fannie Mae offers lots of choices for that great first job.

CMBS Loan Behind Fannie Mae HQ Exit Faces Future Balloon Payment Risks - Commercial Observer,CMBS Loan Behind Fannie Mae HQ Exit Faces Future Balloon Payment Risks  Commercial Observer,"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vY29tbWVyY2lhbG9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS8yMDI0LzAxL2NtYnMtbG9hbi1mYW5uaWUtbWFlLWhlYWRxdWFydGVycy1leGl0LWZ1dHVyZS1iYWxsb29uLXBheW1lbnQtcmlza3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Commercial Observer,"A $382 million senior CMBS loan originated in 2019 for Midtown Center was split across three deals including $261 million in DCOT 2019-MTC, $88.475 million in BANK 2019-BNK22 and $32.525 million in COMM 2019-GC44. There was also $143 million of subordinated debt in DCOT 2019-MTC for the 868,000-square-foot complex on 1100 15th Street NW completed in 2018. The lenders on the transaction, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, structured the fixed-rate debt with a 3.09 percent interest rate as a balloon mortgage with an anticipated payment date in 2029. The loan’s final maturity date is Sept. 30, 2033. “We expect payments to remain current, but we do have a concern with balloon risk,” Jonathan Ramel, vice president of Morningstar Credit Analytics, told Commercial Observer. “In 2029 when there is the anticipated repayment date, the borrower is going to have to decide whether they are going to pay off the loan or refinance, which I think would be tough if the Fannie Mae space is empty.” The CMBS deal is priced at a 39.79 percent loan-to-value ratio, according to loan documents provided by CRED iQ. Fannie Mae’s headquarters space comprises 82 percent of Midland Center’s gross leasable area (GLA). WeWork (WE), a struggling coworking company that filed for bankruptcy protection in November, is the building’s second-largest tenant occupying 109,943 square feet, or 13 percent of GLA, in a lease that runs through 2036. The loan includes a requirement that Fannie Mae pay a $66.2 million termination fee if it exits in 2029, which Ramel said will help fund required rent and debt service payments. While the current office market faces headwinds with increasing hybrid working trends, Ramel said Midland Center benefits from being a newer Class A property with a lengthy period to find a replacement tenant or tenants before 2029. He noted that if the space is filled with multiple tenants, capital upgrades would likely be required. Ramel said that while the WeWork space is far smaller than Fannie Mae’s footprint at the building, there are risks of the space becoming empty in the near term should the company be forced to liquidate assets. Morningstar added the Midtown Center loan to its watchlist after the WeWork bankruptcy. A Carr Properties spokesperson said thw company is “confident that Midtown Center will again attract a notable flagship customer” after Fannie Mae’s exit.

Why Beyoncé name-dropped housing-finance giant Fannie Mae on ‘Cowboy Carter’ - MarketWatch,Why Beyoncé name-dropped housing-finance giant Fannie Mae on ‘Cowboy Carter’  MarketWatch,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmV5b25jZS1uYW1lLWRyb3BzLWhvdXNpbmctZmluYW5jZS1naWFudC1mYW5uaWUtbWFlLW9uLWNvd2JveS1jYXJ0ZXItaGVyZXMtd2hhdC1zaGUtbWVhbnQtZWE5MTkxZGTSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9iZXlvbmNlLW5hbWUtZHJvcHMtaG91c2luZy1maW5hbmNlLWdpYW50LWZhbm5pZS1tYWUtb24tY293Ym95LWNhcnRlci1oZXJlcy13aGF0LXNoZS1tZWFudC1lYTkxOTFkZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,MarketWatch,"What did the artist mean by that? “Beyoncé clearly understands the risks that natural disasters can have on a home’s value,” Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin RDFN, -3.39%, told MarketWatch. She also posted on X about the reference after the album’s release. “Ya Ya” also touches on how hard it can be to get by in the U.S., with lines such as, “Are you tired, workin’ time and a half for half the pay?” With the lyrics referencing Fannie Mae and wildfire destruction, the singer seems to be referring to how more homes are being damaged or destroyed due to the increased incidence of natural disasters fueled in part by climate change — while insurance doesn’t necessarily come to the rescue. Home-insurance coverage has become more expensive and harder to find in California due to wildfires, because insurance companies in the state are finding it financially untenable to continue to offer coverage. Similar challenges are unfolding in Florida, where hurricanes take a toll on homes and insurers’ bottom lines. A representative for Beyoncé did not respond to a request for comment. While Beyoncé’s cover of Dolly Parton’s “Jolene” on “Cowboy Carter” is getting a lot of attention, some listeners also noticed the Fannie Mae reference. What is Fannie Mae and why did Beyoncé sing about it on ‘Ya Ya’? Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that essentially provides money to the mortgage market. As Fairweather explained, the housing giant ensures that mortgage lenders have enough funds to lend to home buyers. “Fannie Mae has a really big role in the housing market … and has been a really critical part of the American dream of homeownership,” said Aniket Mehrotra, a policy assistant at the Urban Institute who posted on LinkedIn about Beyonce’s lyrics, writing they deserve “our full attention.” Mehrotra told MarketWatch: “Regular consumers, homeowners or not, don’t necessarily understand the intricacies of the housing-finance system and how their mortgage works and what’s behind it.” Fannie Mae continually buys mortgages from banks and mortgage lenders to provide them with cash to keep giving out new loans to new borrowers. Lenders have to follow guidelines set by Fannie — and Freddie Mac, another government-sponsored enterprise — so they can sell their loans to the two companies. “It’s important for folks in housing finance to have this issue shouted out, because climate change is set to have a really significant impact on the housing market in a very concerning way,” Mehrotra said. To be clear, Fannie and Freddie — and even Ginnie Mae, a wholly government-owned company that guarantees federally backed loans — don’t service mortgage loans. But “Fannie Mae sometimes facilitates mortgage relief for homeowners affected by wildfires to prevent financial loss and displacement,” Fairweather said. For instance, homeowners with mortgages owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are allowed to delay making monthly mortgage payments for a period of time without incurring fees if they are affected by a disaster, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s website. Why did Beyoncé mention wildfires? Over the last few years, increased incidence of natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires have destroyed properties across the U.S., and many homeowners have had to pay out of pocket to fix the damage. More than 1.2 million homes in California are at moderate or high risk of wildfire damage, CoreLogic estimated in a 2023 report. California leads the U.S. with its number of homes at risk of wildfire damage, whose reconstruction costs are collectively valued at more than $760 billion. As a California homeowner herself — with a $190 million, 40,000-square-foot mansion in Malibu — Beyoncé is familiar with the risks of natural disasters, given that 99% of all properties in the area face wildfire risk, Fairweather said. Malibu is located in Los Angeles, which is the metropolitan area with the greatest number of homes — more than 240,000 — at risk of wildfire damage, the CoreLogic report noted. “Her reference to Fannie Mae shows that she understands that financial support after natural disasters is possible, but not a guarantee, for homeowners,” Fairweather said. What does Fannie Mae say? Fannie Mae declined to comment on the Beyoncé song, but a day after MarketWatch reached out, it published a blog post about a survey showing that consumers are worried about the impact of extreme weather on home-insurance premiums. Two-thirds of the survey respondents reported that weather-related events have affected their insurance premiums, Fannie Mae’s Economic and Strategic Research Group found. One in four homeowners reported a large impact on their insurance premiums, Fannie Mae said, though the blog post did not specify by how much. What’s happening with homeowners insurance? Taking a step back, the “Cowboy Carter” track sheds light on how insurance costs have shifted in light of climate change and natural disasters — and how homeowners are struggling. After all, “Hard workin’ man ain’t got no money in the bank,” as Beyoncé sings in another lyric from “Ya Ya.” “Homeowners may find themselves paying exorbitant amounts to be covered without the guarantee that this coverage will be sufficient based on the severity of damage,” said Fairweather, the Redfin chief economist. Certain homeowners bear this burden disproportionately. “The implications of property destruction are most severe for communities considered more vulnerable and less resilient, including many communities of color,” said a paper published in March by the Urban Institute. “Broadly, communities of color are often more vulnerable to catastrophes and can experience a slower recovery if they experience such events,” the paper’s authors added. “Absent an appropriate policy response, such shocks can worsen racial and ethnic disparities.” And with private companies like State Farm pulling out of states such as California, “home buyers may struggle to get covered at all in climate-risky areas,” Fairweather added. From the archives (May 2023): State Farm cracks down on California wildfire insurance. What it means for all homeowners. In fact, “many consumers are struggling to afford rising premiums and must go without homeowners insurance,” Sharon Cornelissen, the director of housing at the Consumer Federation of America and a co-author of a recent study by the CFA, said in a statement. “That puts them at risk of losing everything,” she added. “One storm or wildfire means they have to go into deep financial debt to repair their home, live with unsafe and inadequate housing, or even become homeless.” Of the more than six million homeowners who lack homeowners insurance, 22% are Native American, 14% are Hispanic and 11% are Black, according to the CFA. “Being uninsured can foster deeper economic precarity for millions of homeowners across the country, especially those with lower incomes, and it is an important contributor to racial inequality,” the CFA said in its report. “Inequalities in who has homeowners insurance will likely widen the long-standing racial wealth gap, as uninsurance disproportionately impacts Hispanic, Black, and Native American homeowners.” How have home-insurance prices and home prices affected you and your financial decisions?

Secure your tickets now! Fading hopes that mortgage rates will come down in the next 12 months are denting consumer sentiment about housing market conditions for the first time since November, according to results of a March survey released Monday by Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae’s Home Purchase Sentiment Index takes six questions from the mortgage giant’s more extensive monthly National Housing Survey and distills them into a single number. The index dropped 0.9 points in March, to 71.9, even though the percentage of consumers who said it was a good time to buy or sell ticked up slightly in March, and most homeowners and renters said they felt confident that home prices aren’t about to crash. Three other components of the index — job loss concerns and the outlook for household income and mortgage rates — decreased, bringing the overall index down by 1 percent. “The HPSI remained relatively flat in March, but we’re seeing signs that consumers may be adjusting their expectations for the housing market to better accommodate the higher mortgage rate and home price environment,” Fannie Mae Chief Economist Doug Duncan said, in a statement that put a positive spin on the numbers. Despite the dip in sentiment, most Americans surveyed in March (68 percent) said they would try to buy a home rather than rent if they were going to move, in line with past surveys. “We noted in our latest monthly forecast that we expect to see a gradual increase in home listings and sales transactions in the coming year,” Duncan said. “We believe this will be driven not only by those coming off the sidelines due to a rate-related recalibration, but also by households who may need to move for other life reasons.” Looking back a year, the Home Purchase Sentiment Index (HPSI) is up 10.6 points. But the index has a ways to go before returning to pre-pandemic levels, when it often surged above 90. Housing affordability continues to weigh on consumer sentiment, with only 21 percent surveyed in March saying it was a good time to buy a home. That’s up two percentage points from February and seven percentage points from November when only 14 percent of consumers thought it was a good time to buy, an all-time low in survey records dating to 2010. With the percentage of consumers who said March was a bad time to buy decreasing to 79 percent from 81 percent in February, the net share who said it was a good time to buy was up 4 percentage points month over month, to negative 58 percent. Tough conditions for buyers are often good news for sellers, and 66 percent of Americans surveyed by Fannie Mae agreed that March was a good time to sell, up from 65 percent in February and 58 percent a year ago. With the percentage who said March was a bad time to sell decreasing to 34 percent, the net share who said it was a good time to sell increased two percentage points month over month, to 32 percent. With 40 percent of those surveyed in March expecting home prices to go up in the next 12 months and 38 percent expecting them to stay the same, more than three-quarters of Americans have few worries that home prices could crash anytime soon. The percentage who expect home prices to fall in the next 12 months decreased to 20 percent, down from 23 percent in February and 31 percent a year ago. While a decline in home prices might be welcomed by many would-be homebuyers, the HPSI treats expectations that home prices will fall as an indication of pessimism. So the 1 percentage increase in the net share of those who said they expect home prices to go up in the next 12 months had a positive impact on the index. The primary factor pushing the HPSI down in March was the dwindling number of Americans who think mortgage rates will come down in the next 12 months. Only 29 percent of those surveyed in March said they expect mortgage rates to come down in the next year, down from 35 percent in February. With 34 percent expecting mortgage rates to rise and 36 percent expecting them to remain the same, the net share expecting mortgage rates to go down over the next 12 months decreased eight percentage points from February to March, dropping to negative 5 percent. Mortgage rates have been on the rise this spring as worrisome inflation data has all but put to rest speculation that the Federal Reserve might cut short-term interest rates before June. The rebound in mortgage rates has already dented homebuyer demand for mortgages, after adjustments for the seasonal bump that usually comes in the spring. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have been flirting with 7 percent this spring, hitting 6.89 percent Friday according to Optimal Blue rate lock data. While economists at Fannie Mae and the Mortgage Bankers Association still expect mortgage rates to come down over the next 12 months, the drop may not happen as quickly or as drastically as previously forecast. In a March 21 forecast, MBA economists predicted rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages will drop to 6.1 percent by the end of this year, and average 5.6 percent in Q4 2024. In a forecast also released in March, economists at Fannie Mae said they didn’t envision rates on 30-year fixed-rate loans hitting 6 percent until Q4 2025. “With the historically low rates of the pandemic era now firmly behind us, some households appear to be moving past the hurdle of last year’s sharp jump in rates, an adjustment that we think could help further thaw the housing market,” Duncan said Monday. While not included in calculating the HPSI, 58 percent of those surveyed by Fannie Mae in March said they thought it would be difficult to get a mortgage, up from 54 percent in February and 52 percent a year ago. While only 23 percent of Americans surveyed by Fannie Mae in March said they were concerned about losing their job, that’s up from 22 percent in February and 21 percent a year ago. The net share of those who said they are not concerned about losing their job fell two percentage points from February to March, denting the overall Home Purchase Sentiment Index. Also weighing on the index was a slight increase in the percentage of consumers who said their household income was significantly lower than it was a year ago. With 12 percent reporting a drop in income and the percentage reporting higher income unchanged at 19 percent, the net share of consumers reporting significantly higher household income dropped two percentage points from February to March. Although the strength of the economy is one reason mortgage rates have been rebounding this year, 71 percent of Americans surveyed by Fannie Mae in March said they thought the economy was on the wrong track. That’s up from 68 percent in February, but down from a 2023 high of 78 percent registered in October. Consumer sentiment about the economy is not factored into the HPSI.

In January, 82% of consumers indicated that they are not concerned about losing their job in the next 12 months, up from 75% last month. Additionally, an all-time survey-high 36% of respondents indicated that they expect mortgage rates to go down in the next 12 months, while 28% expect them to go up, and 35% expect rates to remain the same. However, consumer perceptions of homebuying conditions remain overwhelmingly pessimistic, with only 17% of consumers indicating it's a good time to buy a home. Overall, the full index is up 9.1 points year over year. ""Mortgage rate optimism increased markedly again in January, with a survey-high percentage of consumers anticipating mortgage rate declines over the next year,"" said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. ""For the first time in our National Housing Survey's history, a greater share of consumers believe mortgage rates will decrease over the next year, rather than increase. Consumers also expressed greater confidence in their job situations this month, another sign that housing sentiment may continue to improve in 2024."" Duncan continued: ""However, while home affordability may improve if actual mortgage rates continue moving downward, other parts of the affordability equation have yet to ease or improve for consumers. A large majority still think home prices will either increase or stay the same; the 'good time to buy' component continues to hover near its historical low; and fewer than one-in-five respondents indicated that their household income was significantly higher year over year, matching a survey low. All in all, while a lower mortgage rate path supports our forecast for a gradual increase in housing demand and sales activity in 2024, until we see a meaningful increase in housing supply, we expect affordability will remain a significant barrier to homeownership for many households.""

About Fannie Mae's Home Purchase Sentiment IndexThe Home Purchase Sentiment Index® (HPSI) distills information about consumers' home purchase sentiment from Fannie Mae's National Housing Survey® (NHS) into a single number. The HPSI reflects consumers' current views and forward-looking expectations of housing market conditions and complements existing data sources to inform housing-related analysis and decision making. The HPSI is constructed from answers to six NHS questions that solicit consumers' evaluations of housing market conditions and address topics that are related to their home purchase decisions. The questions ask consumers whether they think that it is a good or bad time to buy or to sell a house, what direction they expect home prices and mortgage interest rates to move, how concerned they are about losing their jobs, and whether their incomes are higher than they were a year earlier. About Fannie Mae's National Housing SurveyThe National Housing Survey (NHS) is a monthly attitudinal survey, launched in 2010, which polls the adult general population of the United States to assess their attitudes toward owning and renting a home, purchase and rental prices, household finances, and overall confidence in the economy. Each respondent is asked more than 100 questions, making the NHS one of the most detailed attitudinal longitudinal surveys of its kind, to track attitudinal shifts, six of which are used to construct the HPSI (findings are compared with the same survey conducted monthly beginning June 2010). For more information, please see the Technical Notes. Fannie Mae conducts this survey and shares monthly and quarterly results so that we may help industry partners and market participants target our collective efforts to support the housing market. The January 2024 National Housing Survey was conducted between January 2, 2024 and January 19, 2024. Most of the data collection occurred during the first two weeks of this period. The latest NHS was conducted exclusively through AmeriSpeak®, NORC at the University of Chicago's probability-based panel, on behalf of PSB Insights and in coordination with Fannie Mae. Calculations are made using unrounded and weighted respondent level data to help ensure precision in NHS results from wave to wave. As a result, minor differences in calculated data (summarized results, net calculations, etc.) of up to 1 percentage point may occur due to rounding.

Fannie Mae to allow validation from a single source - National Mortgage News,Fannie Mae to allow validation from a single source  National Mortgage News,"Thu, 07 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsbW9ydGdhZ2VuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zhbm5pZS1tYWUtdG8tYWxsb3ctdmFsaWRhdGlvbi1mcm9tLWEtc2luZ2xlLXNvdXJjZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,National Mortgage News,"Influential government-related mortgage investor Fannie Mae has announced that a long-planned goal to make validation of certain mortgage information available in one fell swoop is becoming a reality. Fannie will allow 12-months of asset data to verify income and employment when it becomes available for opt-in use on March 29, and for 50% of those who piloted the automated process, it produced ""some level of savings"" in third-party report costs. ""With this new update in Desktop Underwriter, we are removing a hurdle from the loan application process and bringing greater speed, simplicity, and certainty to both lenders and borrowers,"" Cyndi Danko, senior vice president and chief credit officer, said in a press release. The move follows competitor Freddie Mac's expanded use of bank account data. Freddie also allows asset information to be used to validate income, assets and employment checks for certain loans. Verification of assets, income and employment have been attractive because Freddie and Fannie have offered upfront representation and warranty relief for it. Both also have used the bank data for cash-flow underwriting and rent payment validation. What's also significant is that with both competitors offering the process, it's possible for lenders to potentially use digital bank data regardless of which of the two they turn to for loan sales. (While the two aren't the only loan outlets in the U.S., they are major ones and often influential.) ""Now that you have parity between the two GSEs offerings, that's what's going to enable a broader lender engagement and utilization of this type of service,"" said Brian Francis, who oversees the Accountchek digital bank verification product for Informative Research. Variations in the two government-sponsored enterprises' processes regarding the uptake of the consumer-permissioned option, how often it validates all the data points, and how lenders handle the workflow will affect the extent of efficiency available, Francis said. Not every borrower will be verifiable through a single source as some may not have consistent deposit records reflecting employment income. Some other vendors charge mortgage firms separately for data needed at the lender level and Fannie's 12-month report, according to Francis. Also, certain lenders handle the workflow around digital data verification in terms of pulling digital bank, payroll or tax information as needed more manually than others. The success rate of single-source validation has long been an open question. ""You're getting a recurring direct deposit in 70% of the bank accounts that are coming through our system,"" Francis said, noting this may be roughly indicative of how often many people have employment income that's verifiable in this way, most commonly those with traditional salaries. Single-source validations may also cause a wrinkle depending on the extent to which employer names fail to match what's on deposits in situations such as when the payments are made in the name of the benefits provider. Both vendors and Fannie have been researching and developing ways to address situations like that since research into single source validations began in 2017, according to Francis. ""Those specific analyses are proprietary to Fannie. They've not shared them with us, but we've worked with them over the last seven years in helping them to understand the nuances,"" he said. (Fannie had not immediately responded to a follow-up inquiry on this point at deadline.)",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/b4/bc/20f1c819434d828fad0c5bf91852/fannie-mae-website.jpeg,2024-03-07,-0.238,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Francis', 'latitude': 36.29201126098633, 'longitude': -93.18157196044922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Single', 'latitude': 46.29207992553711, 'longitude': 7.343520164489746, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]","Fannie Mae will allow 12-months of asset data to verify income and employment, potentially saving lenders on third-party report costs.

Fannie Mae predicts higher interest rates in latest 2024 outlook - National Mortgage News,Fannie Mae predicts higher interest rates in latest 2024 outlook  National Mortgage News,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsbW9ydGdhZ2VuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zhbm5pZS1tYWUtcHJlZGljdHMtaGlnaGVyLWludGVyZXN0LXJhdGVzLWluLWxhdGVzdC0yMDI0LW91dGxvb2vSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,National Mortgage News,"Fannie Mae is projecting that mortgage rates close out the year at a higher level than what the government-sponsored enterprise had previously predicted, even though it also had a more optimistic view on the overall U.S. economy than in prior forecasts. The 30-year fixed rate mortgage will average 6.5% for the current period, but fall to 5.9% by the fourth quarter and 5.7% for the same period in 2025, the February forecast reads. Its January outlook put the 30-year FRM average at 5.8% for the fourth quarter and 5.5% one year later. In the past two weeks, mortgage rates have zoomed up 26 basis points, bringing the 30-year FRM to 6.9%, according to Freddie Mac, as bond market investors digested the latest news on inflation and how the Federal Reserve would react. The unexpectedly strong fourth quarter 2023 gross domestic product of 3.3% drove Fannie Mae to increase its full-year outlook to 1.7%. But that is still slower than 2023's 3.1%. ""Right now, our base case scenario foresees economic growth decelerating, rates gradually declining, and new single-family home sales slowly recovering as construction adds supply,"" Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae chief economist, said in a press release. ""However, if economic growth continues to surprise to the upside, then we believe the risk of mortgage rates remaining higher for longer will also increase."" Total home sales should increase by 5% this year to just short of 5 million units, seasonally adjusted. New home sales of 734,000 units seasonally adjusted, represents a 9.9% rise. Both numbers are higher than January's 3.7% and 7.7% respective predictions. New home sales data for January released earlier on Feb. 26 found a 1.5% annual increase for the month. ""The outlook for the new single-family home market is positive, but there are challenges,"" First American Financial economist Ksenia Potapov said in a statement on the release. ""Potential home buyers are sensitive to mortgage rate fluctuations and long-term interest rates have risen again in recent weeks in response to stronger-than-expected economic data."" Given those factors, Duncan cut his overall forecast for this year by $60 billion to $1.916 trillion from $1.977 trillion. The reduction was split evenly between the purchase forecast, now $1.457 trillion and refinancings, at $459 billion. February's 2025 outlook is $83 billion lower, $2.358 trillion from $2.441 trillion one month ago. Duncan cut the purchase prediction by $40 billion to $1.649 trillion, while dropping refis by $43 billion to $709 billion. However, the economists at the Mortgage Bankers Association remain more bullish on the market, with its February forecast a shade above the $2 trillion mark, a mere $6 billion lower than a month ago. All of that change comes from the purchase side, down to $1.53 trillion. The MBA's refinance outlook is for $471 billion. Its forecasts for 2025 and 2026 remain unchanged at $2.339 trillion and $2.446 trillion respectively. But First American's Potapov was cautious on the market going forward, stating ""While the Federal Reserve is still expected to cut interest rates later this year and with fundamental demand remaining strong, builders are optimistic for the future. However, the significant boost in home sales activity typical for the spring homebuying season may be delayed later into the summer.""",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/98/92/471e34b2451da744822c295f8055/fm-building.jpg,2024-02-26,-0.319,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Doug Duncan', 'description': 'American politician', 'full_name': 'Doug Duncan', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Duncan_greets_supporters%2C_September_2013.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Total', 'description': 'French energy company', 'full_name': 'TotalEnergies', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Berlin_moabit_tour_total_19.01.2013_13-01-48.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'FRM', 'latitude': 50.85322952270508, 'longitude': -1.1922600269317627, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Duncan', 'latitude': 38.28812026977539, 'longitude': -85.92497253417969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MBA', 'latitude': -1.6971800327301025, 'longitude': 37.618080139160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Potapov', 'latitude': 48.2834587097168, 'longitude': 41.155860900878906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae predicts higher mortgage rates for 2023, with a 30-year fixed rate of 6.5%, but a gradual decline to 5.7% by 2025.

Blog by Quicken Loans,"Perhaps you’ve heard the names Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or simply “Fannie” and “Freddie,” mentioned when people talk about mortgages and the housing market. If you’re slightly familiar with Fannie and Freddie but haven’t taken the time to look into them, maybe you’ve at some point wondered what they are and what they do exactly. To better understand both companies and how they support the mortgage market, we’ll take a close look at how they operate and impact the home buying process. Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac, Explained Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-backed privately held mortgage companies originally created by the U.S. Congress. Known as government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, both companies provide liquidity, stability and affordability to the mortgage market. As a result, both Fannie and Freddie are pivotal to the country’s housing system. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have nicknames derived from their full names: Fannie Mae from the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Freddie Mac from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FMCC). Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae play several key roles in the mortgage market, and we’ll describe these roles in detail in the next few sections. Increasing Liquidity Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages from financial institutions that lend mortgages. They then repackage those mortgages into mortgage-backed securities to sell to investors on the secondary mortgage market. Because Fannie and Freddie have taken the long-term mortgage debt off the lender’s books, the lender has more money available to underwrite mortgages. In turn, this helps more potential buyers become homeowners. Setting Lending Standards Since Fannie and Freddie are a big part of the secondary mortgage market, it’s in a lender’s best interest to be able to sell mortgages to them. However, Fannie and Freddie won’t buy mortgages unless they meet minimum underwriting standards such as the borrower having a minimum credit score of 620 and a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) of 50% or lower. These standards create the framework for conforming conventional loans, which make up the bulk of U.S. mortgages. Encouraging mortgage lenders to conform to these standards helps set a benchmark for the industry and keeps excessive risk out of the mortgage market. Supporting The Secondary Mortgage Market By using mortgage-backed securities and guaranteeing on-time principal payments and interest on the mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entice investors to invest in the secondary mortgage market. The attractiveness of the secondary market results in more housing funds being available. How Do Freddie Mac And Fannie Mae Stabilize The Mortgage Market In Times Of Crisis? During the subprime mortgage crisis and housing crash of 2008, the collapse of the mortgage market and sudden loss of value on mortgage-backed securities caused Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to suffer enormous financial losses. As a part of a federal rescue plan, both GSEs received federal funds so they could keep lending. At the same time, Fannie and Freddie were brought under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac quickly became two of the largest sources for mortgage financing, helping stabilize the housing market and protect lenders. Later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act included provisions such as pandemic-related modifications, forbearances and deferrals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages. This helped protect millions of homeowners from the risk of foreclosure if the pandemic adversely affected them. What’s The Difference Between Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac? While Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a lot in common, they also have some key differences to be aware of. We’ll explore these below. Original Purpose Fannie Mae was created in 1938 by Congress to combat the lack of affordable housing after the Great Depression. It did this by buying mortgages from lenders, which freed the lenders from the debt that came with carrying those mortgages on their books. This in turn opened up lenders to offer more mortgages. For the first few decades of its establishment, Fannie Mae remained a government-owned entity and monopolized the secondary mortgage market. To pay for other priorities, Congress turned Fannie Mae into a private company in 1968. Instead of using taxpayer dollars to fund the newly private company, the government allowed Fannie Mae to sell stocks to shareholders as an initial public offering (IPO). When Fannie Mae was privatized, Congress created Freddie Mac in 1970 to provide competition and an alternative option for credit unions and smaller lenders. Mortgage Sourcing Another key difference between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is where they source their mortgages. While Fannie Mae tends to buy mortgages from larger commercial banks, Freddie Mac tends to buy from smaller banks, such as credit unions and community banks. Credit And Down Payment Requirements Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have similar credit and down payment requirements for a mortgage to qualify and thereby be considered a conforming mortgage. However, the requirements for each differ somewhat. Depending on your circumstances, it may be possible to qualify for a mortgage with Fannie and not Freddie, or vice versa, based on your down payment and credit. How Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac Encourage Low-Income Homeownership Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offer mortgage programs to assist borrowers who earn a low-to-moderate income. This happens by Fannie and Freddie allowing borrowers to qualify for a mortgage with a down payment of as little as 3% of the home purchase price. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offer additional assistance to first-time home buyers by maintaining a list of homes that they own – through foreclosure or deeds in lieu of foreclosure – and offer for sale at a discount. The Bottom Line Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises that help provide stability to the U.S. housing market. As a home buyer, you should be aware of the role each plays in the mortgage process, especially when you’re considering the specific loan requirements you’ll need to meet.

The Enterprises will rebrand the Social Index as the ""Mission Index"" and update its formulation as further described in the Framework. The Mission Index will begin to apply to pools issued by Fannie Mae beginning in March 2024 and for Freddie Mac beginning in June 2024. The Enterprises expect to assign the Social label to Single-Family MBS meeting the Social Bond criteria beginning in June 2024. Fannie Mae plans to provide impact reporting annually beginning in 2025, which will help the market understand the associated impact of the loans underlying their investments. ""Fannie Mae is continuously working to identify new and better ways to draw capital to markets that tie directly to our mission. While supporting mortgage lenders and investors, we also are committed to addressing the many housing challenges facing consumers – including those that disproportionately burden lower- and moderate-income borrowers and renters,"" said Devang Doshi, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. ""By providing investors with greater insight into the mission-oriented lending activities underlying our mortgage-backed securities through our Mission Index disclosures, more capital may be allocated in support of affordable housing so that over time more people have better access to credit.""

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Bose George upgraded the pair to market perform from underperform saying the stocks could continue to climb in the near-term on the chances of a close election. The stocks of both firms — which trade over-the-counter for about $1 apiece — rallied more than 10% over the two trading sessions following Trump’s Iowa win. During his presidential term, Trump backed an attempt to free the government-sponsored enterprises from conservatorship. “While we believe the challenging logistics associated with privatizing the GSEs make the likelihood of privatization relatively low, history suggests that the market believes a Trump administration could potentially accomplish GSE privatization,” George wrote in a note. “Even if there is a change in the White House and GSE recapitalization efforts resume, we see limited longer-term value in the common shares,” the KBW analyst added.

GSEs will not count buyer agent commissions as IPCs - HousingWire,GSEs will not count buyer agent commissions as IPCs  HousingWire,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 20:41:38 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9nc2VzLXdpbGwtbm90LWNvdW50LWJ1eWVyLWFnZW50LWNvbW1pc3Npb25zLWFzLWlwY3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will not count buyer’s agent commissions as part of their allowable interested party contributions (IPCs), according to announcements from the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) on Monday. The GSEs noted that this guidance was not an update to their selling guides but a clarification on the treatment of seller-paid real estate agent fees. Based on the selling guides in use by the GSEs, property sellers are allowed to make financing concessions toward the borrower’s closing costs at a maximum amount of 2% to 9% of the property value. In their guidance issued on Monday, the GSEs note that “fees or costs customarily paid by the property seller according to local convention are not subject to these financing concessions limits.” “Buyer agent fees have historically been fees customarily paid by the property seller or property seller’s real estate agent, and, as such, they are currently excluded from these financing concession limits,” according to the statement from Freddie Mac. Moving forward, the GSEs say that if these fees continue to be “customarily paid by the property seller according to local convention, they will not be subject to financing concessions limits.” These clarifications come after the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reached a nationwide settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the commission lawsuits. If the settlement is approved by the court, although agents and home sellers will not be able to list offers of compensation on the MLS, home sellers may still offer to cover the buyer’s agent fees if they so choose. In late March, NAR and the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) sent a letter to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director Sandra Thompson, Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar, Freddie Mac CEO Michael DeVito, and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Commissioner Julia Gordon asking for the officials to confirm their treatment of IPCs to home purchase transactions. On a recent episode of NextHome CEO James Dwiggins and chief strategy officer Keith Robinson’s podcast “Real Estate Insiders Unfiltered,” NAR president Kevin Sears announced that he received confirmation from Gordon that, per FHA policy, if sellers continue to pay buyer broker commissions and fees as a manner of state and local laws or customs, and if these expenses are reasonable in amount, the existing policy would not treat those payments as interested party contributions. NAR has also reached out to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs seeking similar guidance on VA loans, but Sears said that letter remains unanswered. The Community Home Lenders Association (CHLA) expressed support for the GSEs’ announcement. ”CHLA appreciates Fannie Mae’s clarification today that seller payment of buyer realtor commissions will not be counted towards seller concession caps,” a spokesperson wrote in an email. “CHLA wrote Fannie Mae, along with all of the federal mortgage program regulators, in December to ask for exactly this type of action to protect first time homebuyers in the wake of emerging realtor lawsuits which may shift the responsibility to buy a buyer’s broker from the seller to the buyer.” The American Real Estate Association (AREA), a startup trade organization, also was pleased by Monday’s announcement. “Today’s statement regarding seller commission compensation was well-received,” wrote Jason Haber, the co-founder of AREA. “Next, we hope Fannie will provide a similar framework for buyers. Will buyer payments for their own professional services count against the IPC cap? That remains an open question at this time.”",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1200x700_Freddie_Mac.jpg,2024-04-15,-0.234,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Keith Robinson', 'description': 'American actor', 'full_name': 'Keith Robinson', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Keith_robinson_2020.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NAR', 'latitude': 57.25727844238281, 'longitude': 18.625089645385742, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MBA', 'latitude': -1.6971800327301025, 'longitude': 37.618080139160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gordon', 'latitude': -37.70000076293945, 'longitude': 175.8333282470703, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sears', 'latitude': 38.947898864746094, 'longitude': -77.07991027832031, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CHLA', 'latitude': 45.549720764160156, 'longitude': 41.96305847167969, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'AREA', 'latitude': -8.642800331115723, 'longitude': 122.02369689941406, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae clarifies that buyer's agent commissions will not be counted as interested party contributions, aligning with the treatment of seller-paid real estate agent fees.

Fannie Mae seeking vendors for controversial title pilot - National Mortgage News,Fannie Mae seeking vendors for controversial title pilot  National Mortgage News,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 17:07:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsbW9ydGdhZ2VuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zhbm5pZS1tYWUtc2Vla2luZy12ZW5kb3JzLWZvci1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLXRpdGxlLXBpbG900gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,National Mortgage News,"Fannie Mae on Friday confirmed it will be putting forth a formal solicitation for vendor participation in a Biden administration project that's aimed at making housing more affordable. The request for proposals is in response to interest from providers of title insurance alternatives, according to Fannie, which will be testing whether it'd be safe to waive coverage or possibly even an alternative called the attorney opinion letter, on certain mortgages. The concept has gotten some pushback from the title insurance industry, which has contended that going without title insurance could expose the mortgage business and consumers to undue risk. The American Land Title Association on Monday renewed its challenge to the pilot, reiterating concerns about the risk, asserting that it goes beyond both Fannie's and competitor Freddie Mac's congressional charters. ALTA called for a more deliberate and formal approach. ""It should receive the scrutiny of public comment, review and robust analysis as authorized under the FHFA's Prior Approval for Enterprise Products rule, which was finalized last Spring"" the group said in an emailed response to an inquiry from this publication. ALTA also called for a broader range of public stakeholders beyond federal officials to be involved as part of that process. ""Making homeownership more affordable for Americans is a top priority for the title insurance industry. We believe there should be transparent discussions about how that can be done, particularly without undermining state insurance laws,"" the association said. Fannie has promised that the investigation into the efficacy of waiving coverage in limited circumstances would involve a small number of loans. ""The request for proposal, which will be issued by the end of the second quarter, will provide Fannie Mae the opportunity to evaluate interested industry participants for potential inclusion in the pilot,"" the government-sponsored enterprise said in a statement. Fannie said it would be looking for responses to its RFP from companies ""that have viable technology solutions for managing title-related risk and reducing closing costs for borrowers."" Companies like Voxtur and iTitle Transfer offer such services. The concept Fannie Mae is trying out in regard to title insurance is somewhat similar to its limited waivers for appraisals, which have been most frequently used in conjunction with loans made to existing borrowers. In January, 11% of Fannie's loans had appraisal waivers and a larger percentage used hybrid options, according to AEI Housing Center's analysis. Refinances will be the only type of mortgage involved in the title pilot and they currently represent a relatively smaller share of loans in the market. It's unclear whether the title waiver pilot's reach would be similar to what's been seen in appraisal alternatives if more broadly adopted as the former involves different risks related to whether the lien or right to ownership of the property is contested as opposed to its value. The RFP announcement comes just days after news that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is considering making lenders pay for their portion of the title insurance policy on a newly originated loan. While the CFPB's interest is less specific than Fannie's, it has said that it is ""looking carefully at closing costs and fees consumers may encounter throughout the mortgage process. ""We are working with agencies across the government to foster greater competition in the mortgage market and help Americans save money when purchasing or refinancing a home,"" the bureau added. The CFPB also has made mention of title insurance in the context of a broader push against what it's characterized in a blog as ""junk"" fees, suggesting that some forms of it could be unnecessary. The intersection of the bureau's view of title insurance and that of Fannie Mae's regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's, has been a conundrum, said Peter Idziak, a mortgage attorney at Polunsky Beitel Green, in a statement issued late last week. ""It's schizophrenic for the CFPB to be … decrying lender's title insurance premiums as 'junk fees' while at the same time, FHFA still requires a lender's title policy or attorney title opinion on almost all loans purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,"" he said.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/53/7d/17fca048447d9b5a8f2274faec98/housing-market.jpeg,2024-04-15,-0.167,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Biden', 'latitude': 5.229050159454346, 'longitude': -1.0081199407577515, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ALTA', 'latitude': 69.9688720703125, 'longitude': 23.271650314331055, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Enterprise', 'latitude': 36.02524948120117, 'longitude': -115.241943359375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Spring', 'latitude': 42.956390380859375, 'longitude': 19.534439086914062, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bureau', 'latitude': 41.28919982910156, 'longitude': -89.3664779663086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae is seeking vendors for a pilot program to test waiving title insurance on certain mortgages, aiming to reduce closing costs for borrowers.

"Sellers are the only ones happy in today's housing market, Fannie Mae survey finds - AOL","Sellers are the only ones happy in today's housing market, Fannie Mae survey finds  AOL","Thu, 07 Mar 2024 17:36:53 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvbC5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9zZWxsZXJzLW9ubHktb25lcy1oYXBweS10b2RheS0xNzMwMzc5MTguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,AOL,"Americans haven’t felt this optimistic about the housing market in nearly two years, but it’s home sellers who have anything to be happy about. Fannie Mae’s gauge on housing sentiment increased slightly in February, marking the third consecutive month of improved confidence and the highest level since March 2022. The boost was driven by increased optimism among home sellers as market conditions continued to tip in their favor. In fact, some 65% of consumers surveyed by Fannie Mae said it was a good time to sell, up from 60% in January. But that was countered by would-be buyers, who remain extremely pessimistic, with just 17% saying it was a good time to buy. While would-be buyers remain in low spirits due to woefully low inventory levels and climbing borrowing costs, the uptick in seller confidence could be a sign of more inventory popping up come spring. “Some home sellers will begin to list properties when mortgage rates come down,” Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told reporters last month. “But we are not yet out of the woods.” Read more: Mortgage rates hover around 7% — is this a good time to buy a house? Climbing rates subdue buyer confidence Would-be buyers just can’t shake off the burden of climbing borrowing costs, and it’s curbing their confidence. After falling more than a full point from October’s peak, rates kicked off the year at a low of 6.62% — but the dip didn’t last. The popular 30-year fixed rate rebounded to 6.94% by the end of February, according to Freddie Mac. And there’s no telling if rates will climb further in the weeks to come. The national median list price also increased seasonally to $415,000 in February, up from $409,500 the month prior. According to Realtor.com, that uptick, in tandem with higher mortgage rates, increased the required annual household income to purchase an average home by $4,400 to $86,100 — before taxes and insurance. “Bottom line, affordability is an issue,” Jeff Reynolds, real estate broker and founder of Urban Condo Spaces, told Yahoo Finance. That much was evident in the latest poll of would-be buyers. According to Fannie Mae, some 83% of consumers said they believe it's a bad time to buy, a measure that hasn’t improved since December. Still, both buyers and sellers did express some optimism about the direction of mortgage rates, with 36% expecting rates to go down within the next year. Fannie Mae had forecast rates would level off near the 6% mark by year-end. If that rings true that could give buyers some much-needed relief. “A decline in mortgage rates — and the resulting uptick in sentiment — would obviously bode well for the upcoming spring homebuying season,” said Doug Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist at Fannie Mae. “Although affordability will likely remain a significant challenge for buyers, at least until there’s a meaningful addition to net supply.” Home builders were also confident The nation’s homebuilders also reported improved optimism in February, with expectations that mortgage rates would soften as the spring approaches. According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting rates later this year and low inventory of existing homes on the market were enough to boost their outlook. That optimism, however, translated to fewer incentives for homebuyers in February. Some 25% of builders said they offered a price reduction in February, down from 31% in January and 36% in the last two months of 2023. The average price reduction remained at 6% for the eighth consecutive month, NAHB data showed. Sales incentives also continued to shrink. The share of builders offering some type of concession to close a deal fell to 58% last month, down from 62% in January — its lowest level since August.

NAHB Chairman Alicia Huey, too, noted that lower mortgage rates later this year should sway more sidelined buyers to return to their purchase plans. Huey said: “While mortgage rates still remain too high for many prospective buyers, we anticipate that due to pent-up demand, many more buyers will enter the marketplace if mortgage rates continue to decline this year.” Gabriella Cruz-Martinez is a personal finance and housing reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Harvard Study Again Stirs the Pot on Demotech Ratings of Florida Carriers - Insurance Journal,Harvard Study Again Stirs the Pot on Demotech Ratings of Florida Carriers  Insurance Journal,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 14:51:47 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3VyYW5jZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3Mvc291dGhlYXN0LzIwMjQvMDQvMTUvNzY5OTE2Lmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Insurance Journal,"A study by researchers from Harvard and Columbia universities and at the Federal Reserve has reopened the debate about the financial fortitude and the financial rating system for dozens of Florida property insurance companies. The president of Demotech, the firm that rates the vast majority of Florida-domiciled carriers, said the study was incomplete, out of date, and was a continuation of a “hit job” that began in 2022, after Demotech reportedly warned that it planned to downgrade multiple Florida insurers. “One of the authors contacted us yet never responded when I offered to send whatever data she needed,” Petrelli said in an email. Petrelli did not respond to Insurance Journal when asked for clarification on some of his other points. Demotech’s “A” financial stability ratings have long been considered to be roughly equivalent to AM Best’s “B”-level ratings, which are strong enough for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the quasi-governmental entities (GSEs) that buy mortgages and require homes to be insured. But the study found that Demotech’s examinations and ratings are not as rigorous. “In particular, our estimates imply that close to 67% of Demotech insurers would not meet Freddie Mac’s eligibility requirement and 21% would not meet Fannie Mae’s requirement (at a 90% confidence level),” reads the paper. “Overall, these results strongly suggest inconsistencies in the GSE eligibility requirements across rating agencies. These inconsistencies could encourage ratings shopping, in particular among poor quality insurers who would not otherwise meet GSE eligibility.” The Florida Association of Insurance Agents’ president, who was one of several officials who sharply criticized Demotech in 2022, declined to comment about the study. But others in the insurance industry, including Florida regulators and some reinsurers, have questioned the soundness of Demotech’s rating system, warning that the firm has been inconsistent and has not followed its own criteria at times. Despite Demotech’s strong ratings of several Florida carriers, for example, Everest Re Group last year dropped some Florida insurers from its portfolio, noting that they did not meet underwriting standards. And in Arkansas last fall, United Home Insurance Co. was rated highly by Demotech – just days before it was placed in receivership. The uproar over Demotech’s ratings was so strong in 2022 that Florida officials and some insurers called for a new approach – switching to KBRA, formerly known as Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or establishing a state-run rating agency. In the ensuing months, though, the state plan received little attention from Florida lawmakers. And only a handful of Florida carriers moved over to KBRA. Petrelli and others have been quick to remind Floridians that much of the Florida-grown insurance market may not exist without Demotech’s ratings. After Hurricane Andrew slammed south Florida in 1992, a number of major national carriers pulled out of the state. As smaller, Florida-domiciled insurers cropped up to fill the gap, Demotech was often the only firm that would provide examinations and ratings, allowing the new carriers to write homes with Fannie- and Freddie-backed mortgages. The recent study, by Paranitha Sastry of Columbia, Ishita Sen of Harvard, and Ana-Maria Tenekedjieva of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, finds “that these new insurers would not meet GSE eligibility thresholds if subjected to traditional rating agencies’ methodologies.” That causes mortgage lenders to sell a large portion of their loans to Fannie and Freddie. And that, in turn, leads the GSEs to bear a large share of insurance counterparty risk, “driven by their mis-calibrated insurer eligibility requirements and lax insurance regulation.” The Demotech ratings have inconsistencies and are not as meaningful as one would hope, co-author Sen told the Tampa Bay Times last week. A statement from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae said the organizations review insurance company ratings, but do not try to influence the rating firms’ methodologies. The study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, raises its own questions and examines issues that some would say are old news in Florida. It also appears to refer to Demotech as an “emerging rating agency,” despite the fact that Demotech has been in business for more than 40 years. And the review is based partly on data resulting from Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida in 2017. The analysis noted that fragile insurance carriers may have caused some homeowners to default on the loans, perhaps after suffering heavy losses in hurricanes and being unable to recoup full replacement value from their insurance policies. The authors recommend that insurers should be rated by at least two rating firms. The report came amid a growing sense of relief in the Florida market, after four years of insolvencies and soaring premiums. One carrier, Florida Peninsula, recently announced a slight reduction in average rates in the state. And in the last 18 months, Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation has approved eight new carriers. Five of those were recently granted “A” stability ratings by Demotech. The startup known as Manatee Insurance Exchange, part of Safepoint Holdings Inc., was rated “A” by Demotech but received a “BBB” rating from KBRA. Ditto for Orange Insurance Exchange. Orion180 Insurance Co. was rated as “A” by Demotech and “BBB+” by KBRA. Two other startups have yet to be rated by any of the three rating firms. Mainsail, part of Spinnaker Insurance, is not rated by Demotech but won an “A-” or Excellent rating from AM Best. The Harvard/Columbia report can be seen here.

Why Millions Are Unable to Benefit From Record-Low Mortgage Rates - Yahoo Movies Canada,Why Millions Are Unable to Benefit From Record-Low Mortgage Rates  Yahoo Movies Canada,"Sat, 13 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvMjAxMi0xMC0yNS13aHktbWlsbGlvbnMtYXJlLXVuYWJsZS10by1iZW5lZml0LWZyb20tcmVjb3JkLWxvdy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Movies Canada,"Over the past few years, mortgage rates have displayed a more or less steady downward trend. Thanks in large part to the Federal Reserve's unprecedented use of its monetary policy tools, rates are now at record lows. Prospective homeowners should be dancing with joy. But most aren't. Millions are unable to take advantage of these record low rates because of a dramatic tightening of mortgage credit availability. An era of unprecedented Fed interventionSince the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has assumed an unparalleled role in the markets. It has bought nearly $3 trillion worth of bonds since 2008 in an effort to keep interest rates very low and shore up the ailing economy. Most recently, the Fed embarked on its latest round of quantitative easing, or QE3, which entails open-ended purchases of mortgage-backed securities in an effort to drive down mortgage rates even further. So far, the plan has been met with some success, as the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen by about 0.2% since the Fed's announcement on September 13. But despite the central bank's efforts, a large chunk of American households is unable to take advantage of drastically reduced borrowing costs. Millions still can't get a loan and are burdened by the persistent overhang of debt. To understand why, it's important to assess the moving parts within the housing finance system. Why is mortgage credit so tight? Part of the reason banks are reluctant to make home loans has to do with something called ""put-back"" risk. Over the past few years, the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been requiring banks to repurchase a ton of soured loans that the banks made and then sold to Fannie and Freddie. While the GSEs argue that put-backs are a crucial part of improving the underwriting process, which went haywire in the three or four years leading up to the housing bust, the banks are not so happy. They argue that the only way for them to protect against the GSE-inflicted ""put-back"" risk is by tightening credit and documentation standards for new borrowers. The Federal Reserve, in a recent survey of senior loan officers, reaffirmed this view. The survey's results showed that ""put-back"" risk was the most important factor constraining lending. A third of survey respondents cited this risk as a ""very important"" factor, while another quarter called it the most important factor. Higher credit and documentation requirements One key area where this tightening is most evident is in higher FICO score requirements for new borrowers. FICO scores, which range from 300 to 850, are a commonly used metric to help lenders assess the credit profile of each borrower. Lower scores indicate a higher probability of the borrower defaulting, and higher scores, a lower probability. According to Ellie Mae, a software provider serving the mortgage industry, the average FICO score for borrowers who received new loans in August was 750, nine points higher than in the year-earlier period. And for loans approved by Fannie and Freddie, the average score was even higher. In August, the average borrower approved by Fannie and Freddie reported a FICO score of 769, up six points from a year ago. Given that nearly 80% of all U.S. consumers have a FICO score of less than 750, this means that the vast majority of would-be homeowners are effectively shut out of the market for mortgage finance. Besides higher FICO requirements, there are other important constraints on lending. For instance, documentation standards and down payment requirements have also tightened over the past few years. In August, the typical borrower who was rejected by Fannie and Freddie had a FICO score of 734 and was willing to put down 19%. At virtually any other time in recent memory, a borrower with this kind of credit profile could have easily obtained a loan. And lastly, the loan process itself has been slowing down, most likely because of the stringency of all these different requirements. According to Ellie Mae, it took 49 days on average from the time an application was made to when it was closed in August, which represents a nine-day increase from a year earlier. Who wins and who loses with low rates? Going forward, the tight lending standards holding back the housing recovery should gradually begin to ease. As home prices stabilize and regulators offer more clarity on the future direction of loan requirements, mortgage lenders should hopefully start making more loans to qualified borrowers. Moreover, if banks become willing to accept a lower profit margin on the mortgages they make and then sell into the secondary market (no doubt a huge ""if""), mortgage rates should fall further, providing an additional incentive to the marginal buyer and those seeking to refinance. While record-low rates that have prompted a surge in refinancing are great news for homeowners, they're not so kind to mortgage REITs. For several years now, mortgage REITs have earned fat profits thanks to near zero short-term rates. But lately, there has been increasing concern regarding the outlook for these dividend dynamos. Firstly, interest rate spreads are narrowing, which limits the profits mortgage REITs can earn. Short-term rates are still near zero, but central bank intervention has also driven down long-term rates. Secondly, prepayment risks are on the rise because of the refinancing boom. What's important to remember here is that not all mortgage REITs are affected by these forces to the same degree. On one end of the mREIT spectrum are companies like Annaly Capital (NYS: NLY) and American Capital Agency (NAS: AGNC) , which invest exclusively in agency-backed securities. These types of securities are less risky because they come affixed with an implicit protection against default through the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. On the other hand, mortgage REITs like Invesco Capital Mortgage (NYS: IVR) , Chimera Investment (NYS: CIM) , and Two Harbors Investment (NYS: TWO) are buyers of both agency and non-agency securities. While these firms can potentially see higher net interest margins, they also take on greater risk than firms invested solely in agency securities.

HFA loans: Everything you need to know - AOL,HFA loans: Everything you need to know  AOL,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 16:15:09 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvbC5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9oZmEtbG9hbnMtZXZlcnl0aGluZy1rbm93LTE1NTUwNDkwNi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,AOL,"Key takeaways HFA loans are mortgages available solely through state housing finance agencies.Geared toward first-time and low- to moderate-income homebuyers, HFA loans feature low down payments, competitive interest rates and down payment and closing cost assistance.HFA terms and qualifications vary by state, which may impose income and purchase price limits on borrowers. No, “HFA loan” is not a misidentification of the better-known FHA loan. It’s a wholly different type of mortgage, offered through state housing finance agencies (HFAs) in partnership with major loan providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. HFA loans help make homeownership more affordable for first-time homebuyers and low- to moderate-income borrowers, thanks to their reduced interest rates and closing costs, as well as their down payment assistance options. What is an HFA loan? HFA loans are conventional mortgages, issued by private lenders, which must conform to guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. HFAs support affordable housing initiatives, including helping homebuyers, homeowners and renters. While their exact function and relationship to their state government varies, HFAs typically act as independent organizations, overseen by a board of directors appointed by the state’s governor. They might be referred to as the state’s housing “authority,” “commission,” “corporation” or “department.” Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that back much of the mortgage market in the U.S. They work with state housing authorities (HFAs) nationwide to offer these loans. Fannie and Freddie design the loans and their terms, but neither they nor the state directly funds them or deals directly with applicants. Instead, they work through a selection of approved, private mortgage lenders. How does an HFA loan work? HFA loans come with many caveats. You have to meet your state program’s requirements for income and homeownership status (you typically can’t have owned a house within the past three years.) And you’ll probably need to take a homebuyer education course designed to prepare you for the homebuying process. Once you’re approved, you can often finance the down payment with down payment assistance, which is provided through the HFA. The assistance could be in the shape of a second mortgage (with very generous terms), a forgivable loan (that doesn’t need to be repaid in full or in part if you meet certain conditions), or even an outright grant (like HFA Preferred grants), depending on what that particular state authority offers. Often this assistance is only available if you are financing with an HFA loan. HFA loan requirements To qualify for one of these mortgages, you generally must meet a few basic HFA loan requirements: Down payment: 3 percent for single-family homesCredit score: at least 620Debt-to-income ratio: 45 percentOccupancy requirement: At least one borrower must use the home as a primary residence Your local HFA may have extra minimums you must meet. Often, you need to be within certain income and purchase price limits that vary by county/municipality and household size. And of course, you have to be buying the home within the state. Types of HFA loans There are two types of HFA loans: Fannie Mae’s (called HFA Preferred) and Freddie Mac’s (known as HFA Advantage). Some states offer both HFA Preferred and HFA Advantage loans; some opt to go with one type exclusively. Here’s how the two types compare. HFA vs. FHA mortgage loans An HFA loan and FHA loan might sound the same — and have similar characteristics, like a low down payment — but they are two separate types of mortgages. Let’s dive into some of the similarities and differences. HFA loan pros and cons An HFA mortgage has its pros and cons to consider before deciding if it’s the best choice for you: Pros of HFA loans Low down payment requirement and closing costs: With an HFA loan, you can put down as little as 3 percent. Closing and upfront fees tend to be low.Financial assistance: Many HFAs offer assistance with closing costs or down payments.Lower mortgage insurance costs/easier insurance elimination: HFA loans charge less for mortgage insurance and eliminate insurance payments automatically upon reaching 80 percent loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Other programs, like FHA loans, make it harder — if not impossible — to get out of mortgage insurance, as long as the loan is active. Cons of HFA loans Not widely available: You can only get an HFA loan from your local state agency. Other types of loans are more widely available.Income limits: HFA loans are for people with incomes lower than the median of their geographic area.Inconsistent rules: Each HFA can set different rules and requirements, so you need to check with your specific HFA to learn if you’re eligible.Higher credit score requirements: Though low, HFA loans have higher credit score minimums than some alternatives like FHA loans. Who is an HFA loan best for? Getting an HFA loan might be a better idea for certain people. Consider an HFA loan if you fall into at least one of these categories: First-time buyers. The definition is broad enough to include first-time homeowners and buyers who haven’t owned a home in the past three years.Those with moderate incomes. To qualify, your income must fall within the HFA’s income limits, which are typically set yearly and vary from state to state — and even counties within the state. Those with high incomes should look elsewhere.Owner-occupants. HFAs aren’t available for investment properties or vacation homes. Rather, they’re for principal residences.House hackers. HFA loans do allow purchases of two- to four-unit residences, meaning you could finance a duplex, divided townhouse or small apartment building. You’d just need to occupy one unit and rent out the rest, a strategy sometimes known as “house hacking.” How to apply for an HFA loan Explore your HFA’s options. Each HFA has its own requirements for HFA loans, and could also offer alternative programs and assistance. You can find your HFA’s website through our guide to first-time homebuyer programs by state.Contact the state housing authority. Depending on the HFA, you can either fill out a form online to get in touch for more information, or call the agency directly.Find an approved mortgage lender. HFA loans are only offered through lending partners approved by your HFA. You can find a list of these lenders on your HFA’s website.Compare lender reviews and testimonials to help narrow your options. From there, you can move forward with a preapproval and application, and a homebuyer course, if needed. When you apply for an HFA loan, be prepared to provide all of your financial information, including paystubs and tax returns. Other low-down payment mortgages Whether you’re a first-time or repeat homebuyer, there are several other low down payment mortgage options. Some of the most popular include: FHA loans: More widely available than HFA loans. Lower credit score requirements. 3.5 percent down payment requirement.VA loans: Only available to veterans and service members. No down payment requirement.USDA loans: Only available in specific areas. No down payment requirement.HomeReady/Home Possible loans: 3-5 percent down payment required. Lower mortgage insurance costs. Income limit of 80 percent of the local area median income.Conventional 97 loan: Conventional mortgage with 3 percent down payment requirement. HFA loan FAQ What are HFA mortgage rates?HFA mortgage rates can vary with market rates and the HFA you work with. They tend to be quite competitive with national average rates. To find up-to-date rates, contact your state’s HFA.Can I use down payment assistance with an HFA mortgage?Yes, you can use down payment assistance when applying for an HFA mortgage. Your HFA may be able to help you find assistance.Do HFA mortgages have PMI?Yes, HFA mortgages require mortgage insurance payments. You can get out of these payments once you reach an 80 percent LTV ratio or 20 percent home equity.Can you refinance to an HFA loan?Yes, it is possible to refinance to an HFA loan. Depending on the type of HFA loan you have, you may or may not be able to take cash out during closing.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vfO_EqGRMtcugcHKWpy9_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_bankrate_605/0b92f3308ecc4aab76188eb1d778d1d8,2024-04-15,-0.101,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Low', 'latitude': 35.84003829956055, 'longitude': -105.05333709716797, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'House', 'latitude': 34.646728515625, 'longitude': -103.90441131591797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not-related content.

Over time, Annaly’s total return, including reinvested dividends, was around -20%, and its market capitalization fell by almost half. However, as is often the case with high performing stocks, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The same goes for Annaly, whose stock could outperform over the next three years. Why have the past three years been difficult for Annaly? The reason for Annaly’s poor performance over the past three years is actually quite simple. At its core, the company is an investment company that holds a leveraged portfolio of agency MBS. MBS are essentially bonds backed by residential real estate and guaranteed against default by a government-backed agency. Although corporate-backed securities like Fannie Mae eliminate most of the credit risk associated with these investments, a company’s interest rate risk is not reduced but only increased by the leverage used. When interest rates rise, mortgage rates tend to rise as well, and the present value of the securities held by Annaly decreases. The Fed began aggressive tightening in March 2022, raising interest rates 11 times. The target for the federal funds rate was raised from a range of 0.25% to 0.50% to 5.25% to 5.50%, and remains unchanged. In addition to rising interest rates, the widening spread between 10-year Treasury yields and agency MBS yields is putting pressure on Analy’s MBS portfolio. Over the past three years, the spread has widened to twice his historical average. As a result, mortgage interest rates rose more than government bond yields during this period, further impacting the value of MBS securities. Mortgage REITs like Annaly are typically valued based on the value of their investment holdings. This makes sense because when you buy Annaly stock, you are essentially buying his MBS portfolio within it. Unsurprisingly, the value of its portfolio has declined given that Annaly faces pressure from rising interest rates and widening spreads. The value of the company’s portfolio, reflected in its book value, has fallen from a split-adjusted $35.68 at the end of 2020 to $19.44 at the end of 2023. Therefore, over the past three years, Annaly stock has basically seen a decline in book value. Better days will come The good thing going forward for Annaly is that the Fed has stopped raising interest rates. Some Fed officials have said recently that there is no need to rush to cut rates, but based on the March Fed dot plot chart, most Fed officials still expect a 75 basis point cut this year. are doing. This chart shows what interest rates will be for each FOMC member over the next few years. More importantly, this chart shows that Fed officials expect the federal funds rate to fall from the current 5.25% to 5.50% to 3.00% to 3.25% by the end of 2026. This would well for Annaly’s portfolio, which is focused on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with coupon rates of 4% to 6%. This combination allows the company to benefit from lower interest rates while avoiding the risk of early repayments that often occur when many homeowners begin refinancing. The mortgage REIT also shifted nearly 8% of its portfolio to high-quality non-agency MBS to boost returns. A further 4% of the portfolio consists of mortgage servicing rights (MSR), which are expected to be less sensitive to interest rates. Annalee invests in his MSRs with low coupons because the biggest risk with these assets tends to be early repayments. Once the MBS market starts to improve, Analy should be able to increase leverage. The company ended 2023 with economic leverage of 5.7 times. Before the pandemic, the company’s debt-to-equity ratio was 7.2 times at the end of 2019 and 7.0 times at the end of 2018. The additional leverage allows Analy to generate more net investment to support the dividend. What’s going on with Annaly Although there haven’t been many periods of interest rate cuts in recent years, Annaly’s book value and share price did very well during the interest rate cutting cycles of 2001-2003 and 2007-2008. Interest Rates Although the cuts are unlikely to be as severe in the coming years, Annaly will still benefit significantly from this change. As you can see from the chart above, stock prices nearly doubled during both rate cuts. If the Fed cuts interest rates by about 2% over the next three years, Annaly stock should be well above where it is trading today. Add in the current solid 14% dividend yield, and the stock looks like an attractive buy at current levels.",https://www.featureweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/897480a29c43580b94ad386c07353eac.jpeg,2024-04-15,-0.387,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Annaly', 'latitude': -19.896190643310547, 'longitude': 28.838359832763672, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'REIT', 'latitude': 48.16682052612305, 'longitude': 12.020119667053223, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MSR', 'latitude': 51.32918930053711, 'longitude': 1.3167999982833862, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not-related content.

UBS lost 1.9 billion francs in the final quarter of 2012, when its earnings were dragged down by litigation and restructuring charges. The bank said its pre-tax operating profit in the October-December period came in at 449 million francs, compared with a 1.84 billion-franc loss a year earlier, thanks to an increase in fee and commission income largely at its investment bank unit. UBS also reported a net income tax benefit of 470 million francs on deferred taxes. The bank's full-year net profit for 2013 totaled 3.17 billion francs. That compared with a loss of 2.48 billion francs in 2012. UBS said it will propose a 67 percent dividend increase to 0.25 francs per share. In 2012, UBS agreed to pay fines for allegedly manipulating, along with other banks, a key market interest rate known as LIBOR. UBS and 17 other financial firms were also sued by the U.S. government for selling some $196 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities to housing financing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For last year's fourth quarter, UBS reported 79 million francs in provisions for litigation and regulatory expenses — far below the 2.08 billion francs it set aside a year earlier. Full-year provisions declined to 1.7 billion francs from 2.55 billion francs in 2012. For this year, UBS said that uncertainty over global growth, fragility in emerging markets and unresolved issues in Europe and the U.S. ""make improvements in prevailing market conditions unlikely."" However, it said that ""despite possible headwinds, we expect that our wealth management businesses will continue to attract net new money.""",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,2014-02-04,-0.086,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'BERLIN', 'latitude': 52.52436828613281, 'longitude': 13.410530090332031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Switzerland', 'latitude': 47.000160217285156, 'longitude': 8.014269828796387, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'UBS', 'latitude': 47.32661056518555, 'longitude': 8.800040245056152, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Europe', 'latitude': 48.69095993041992, 'longitude': 9.140620231628418, 'location_type': 'CONTINENT'}]",Not-related content.

Mortgage Rates Predictions 2025: Will they Drop? - Norada Real Estate Investments,Mortgage Rates Predictions 2025: Will they Drop?

It's a crucial question, as even a small fluctuation in rates can significantly impact monthly payments and overall affordability. Looking ahead, experts offer a range of predictions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. Factors such as inflation, economic growth, monetary policy, and global market conditions all play a role in shaping the future of mortgage rates. A conservative estimate suggests that 30-year fixed mortgage rates could be in the range of 5.5% to 7% by 2025. This prediction takes into account potential economic growth, the Federal Reserve's likely responses to changing conditions, and the broader real estate market's status. Other forecasts are slightly more optimistic, with projections of a gradual decrease in mortgage rates over the next 18 months. For instance, Fannie Mae anticipates rates might slide to 6.0%, Wells Fargo expects around 5.8%, and the Mortgage Bankers Association estimates rates could fall to 5.5% by the final quarter of 2025. However, it's important to note that these predictions come with a degree of uncertainty. The past few years have shown that unprecedented events, such as the pandemic and geopolitical tensions, can rapidly alter the economic landscape. As a result, forecasters often advise caution and suggest that these projections are best viewed as guidelines rather than guarantees. The consensus among experts is that while rates are expected to peak soon due to high inflation and policy measures, they will likely remain above historical lows. This means that while we may not see the rock-bottom rates of the early 2020s, there is also little expectation of a return to the double-digit rates of the 1980s. Will Mortgage Rates Decline in 2025? According to recent analyses and expert predictions, there is a sense of cautious optimism about the potential for mortgage rates to trend downward in 2025. The Mortgage Bankers Association, for instance, has projected that 30-year mortgage rates could fall to around 5.6%. This forecast is based on current market trends and economic indicators, suggesting a silver lining for those hoping for more favorable borrowing conditions. The current landscape of mortgage rates has been shaped by a variety of factors, including inflation, Federal Reserve policies, and global economic conditions. In the past, rates below 4% were considered competitive, with a historical low point of around 3.75% in 2020 serving as a benchmark for what constitutes a ‘good‘ rate. However, the economic turmoil and policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to fluctuations that defy simple predictions. Looking ahead, the expectation of a downward trend is influenced by several factors. Economic recovery, inflation expectations, and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy are all expected to play a role in shaping mortgage rates in the coming years. The Federal Reserve, in particular, is anticipated to continue its delicate balancing act, adjusting interest rates to maintain economic stability while fostering growth. It's important to note, however, that these predictions are not guaranteed. The financial landscape is complex and subject to change due to unforeseen global events and policy shifts. Therefore, while the projections provide a general direction, individuals should remain vigilant and consult with financial advisors to understand how these trends may affect their personal circumstances. In summary, while there is hope for a decrease in mortgage rates by 2025, it is crucial for potential borrowers to stay informed and prepared for any outcome. By keeping an eye on economic developments and seeking professional advice, one can navigate the mortgage market with greater confidence and make decisions that align with their financial goals.",https://www.noradarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mortgage-rates-predictions-for-2025.jpeg,2024-04-15,0.234,[],"Fannie Mae predicts a gradual decrease in mortgage rates over the next 18 months, with a projection of 6.0% by the end of 2025."

Broader worries about the economy are now weighing on sentiment. In the latest survey from Fannie Mae measuring housing sentiment, 85% of respondents in October said now is a bad time to purchase a house because of high home prices and high mortgage rates. That marked a survey high. Their downbeat outlook extended beyond housing, with 78% of respondents saying the economy is on the wrong track, Fannie Mae found. That’s up 7 percentage points from last month, with the vast majority once again saying inflation is the main culprit. ""Consumers expressed even greater pessimism toward the larger economy this month, in addition to their ongoing frustration with the housing market,"" Fannie Mae chief economist Doug Duncan said in a statement. ""We expect this tightness in household finances, along with high home prices and elevated mortgage rates, to prolong the affordability challenges facing many would-be homebuyers.""

'A big constraint' Only 17% of respondents believe that mortgage rates will go down over the next 12 months, according to Fannie Mae, while 47% expect rates will increase and 36% expect rates to stay where they are. ""Interest rate headwinds have been unfortunate for buyers and we’re seeing a lot of frustration on their end,"" Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, told Yahoo Finance. Rates have hovered above 7% since mid-August, a stretch not seen since 2000. And though the 30-year fixed mortgage rate paused its multiweek climb toward 8% last week, ""geopolitical uncertainty and continued ambiguity"" around the Federal Reserve’s next moves ""continue to stall improvements in the housing market,"" Freddie Mac chief economist Sam Khater said last week. Elevated rates are also keeping homeowners from selling. More than a third of respondents said it’s a bad time to sell a home, Fannie Mae found. ""Any seller with a 3% rate will look at today’s rates that are more than double — at 8% or more — and they are just not prepared to take on that higher monthly payment,"" Jeffrey Ruben, president of WSFS Mortgage, told Yahoo Finance. ""It’s become a big constraint to inventory and sales."" The continued dearth of resale properties on the market has propped up home prices, increasing affordability challenges. The latest reading on home values showed that prices hit another record high in August, and many Americans expect no relief any time soon. Read more: How much house can I afford? Just over three-quarters of survey respondents expect prices to go up or remain where they are in the next 12 months, according to Fannie Mae. Just 23% believe prices will go down in that same period. ""Traditionally when rates go up, prices go down to compensate for that. But when you have restricted inventory, prices aren’t going down, so you just are left hanging in there,"" Ruben said. ""It’s really depressed the market."" 'Consumers are fed up' That pessimism is also overtaking the bright spots in Americans’ lives. Greater shares of survey respondents felt good about their job security, their income, and the future of their personal finance situation versus the prior month, Fannie Mae found. Still, 78% of Americans think the economy is going in the wrong direction, up from 71% the previous month. That was also the highest share since June 2022 when 81% of respondents felt that way and the third-highest percentage since March 2011 when the question was first asked. ""Although the labor market is strong and wages have risen in the past year, consumers may believe that their purchasing power has not kept up with prices,"" Duncan said.

LUCIE — The city will be expanding the amount of help it gives to some residents looking to purchase affordable housing, after a 4-1 vote at a City Council workshop Monday. The majority of councilmembers agreed with doubling a $50,000 maximum the council had previously set for downpayment assistance for new homebuyers looking to join the city's community land trust program. The downpayment assistance increase, an initial pilot program, will be paid for with federal money from the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. The number of homes added to inventory is estimated at about six, Deputy Director of Community Programs Alex Tasca said. That number could change ""plus or minus one or two"" depending on the amount of subsidy new homebuyers qualify for. Though a date has not yet been selected to open the application window, Tasca said, the city expects interest to be extremely high. With roughly enough money for six houses, there could be hundreds of applications. ""We will open a pre-application online and that is how people will put their name in,"" Tasca said. ""We will keep that open for as long as we can depending on how many entries we get because we probably don’t want to exceed about 300-400."" The application window will be advertised at least three to four weeks before it is opened, Tasca said. Once it is opened, a list of names will be randomly selected before being vetted for eligibility. ""We have to do it this way because the demand is high and to keep it as open and fair as possible,"" Tasca said. ""We will never keep a waiting list for programs like this after the grants funds are exhausted, but re-open the pre-application every time we have a new program to open."" Program started with six houses The city first began its community land trust program in 2022, through its Neighborhood Services Department and in partnership with the existing Community Land Trust of Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast. That year, the city sold six properties it had purchased to qualified households, with a maximum income of no more than 80% of the area's median income. The federal government determines the area median income. In St. Lucie County, it's $84,800, meaning the 80% maximum is set at $67,840, according to Fannie Mae's AMI lookup tool. As part of the community land trust model, any future sales of those houses must be sold at an affordable price to another qualified household. That price is determined based on a formula using the purchaser's household income. Such an agreement ensures the property remains affordable, increasing the impact of the city's investment. These funds will be used differently The houses purchased under the new program would have two key differences from those initial six. The new model would see potential homebuyers find the house they would like to purchase on the open market, and then they could apply to the city for up to $100,000 in down payment assistance. Second, the cutoff would be set at 120% of the area median income, rather than 80%. According to Fannie Mae's AMI lookup tool, that percentage would equate to $101,760 for a household. By taking the down payment assistance, the homebuyer would agree to add the property to the community land trust, taking on those affordability and eligibility requirements for future sales. Finding the right number to match the housing market Initially in August, the city council approved a $50,000 maximum in down payment assistance for the new program. However, city staff and community land trust consultant Julie Brunner determined only four available houses would meet city standards to be available under that price. With the bar raised to $100,000, the number of viable houses increases to 28, Brunner said. Vice Mayor Jolien Caraballo said she had initial concerns $50,000 would not be enough in today's market. ""I'm glad to see we're bringing it back but that it's going to be at 100,"" Caraballo said. The lone no vote was Councilman Anthony Bonna, who said he supported the program but wanted a lower assistance amount. ""I'm comfortable with up to ($75,000),"" Bonna said, later adding he would also be comfortable with $100,000 if the council had to approve any assistance above $75,000. Brunner said $75,000 would result in 12 viable properties. More: Community land trust model could grow in St. Lucie County amid affordable-housing shortage More: Port St. Lucie ready to unveil memorial to Floridians who died in Iraq, Afghanistan wars Bonna's concerns did not sway the other council members or Mayor Shannon Martin. ""The goal is to help as many people as we possibly can,"" Martin said, later adding she did not want to force people to ""settle"" for a worse situation to qualify. A second request to put $970,000 of city funds towards the community land trust program was pushed back to the council's summer workshop, scheduled for July. That would give staff time to review the success of the down payment assistance program, Martin said. Wicker Perlis is TCPalm's Watchdog Reporter for St. Lucie County.

Mortgage Rate Predictions for Next 5 Years - Norada Real Estate Investments,Mortgage Rate Predictions for Next 5 Years  Norada Real Estate Investments,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 16:26:31 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcmFkYXJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tL2Jsb2cvbW9ydGdhZ2UtcmF0ZS1wcmVkaWN0aW9ucy1mb3ItbmV4dC01LXllYXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Norada Real Estate Investments,"The landscape of US mortgage rates is a dynamic and ever-evolving arena, influenced by a myriad of economic factors and policy decisions. As we look ahead to the next five years, potential homebuyers and current homeowners are keenly interested in how these rates might fluctuate, impacting affordability and the housing market at large. Current Trends and Forecasts for Next 5 Years Recent analyses and expert forecasts suggest a period of fluctuation in mortgage rates in the United States. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has remained below 7% in 2024, with expectations of a gradual decrease over the year, assuming the Federal Reserve implements anticipated interest rate cuts. This aligns with projections from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), which anticipates the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to end 2024 at 6.1%, with a further decline to 5.5% by the end of 2025. Fannie Mae's Housing Forecast echoes this sentiment, predicting the 30-year mortgage rate to conclude 2024 at 6.4%, a slight uptick from previous forecasts, but still indicative of a downward trend. Similarly, insights from the National Association of Realtors and Bank of America suggest rates hovering in the 6% to 7% range for the majority of the year, with potential rate reductions later in the year as economic conditions evolve. The U.S. News Housing Market Index provides a broader perspective, indicating that while mortgage rates are expected to slowly fall, the housing market will experience a gradual thaw, with prices stabilizing due to a persistent lack of supply. This gradual decline in rates is anticipated to encourage a rebound in existing home sales, which had fallen to a 28-year low in 2023. Trading Economics offers a more optimistic outlook, predicting a rise to 5% in 2023 before falling to 4.25% in 2024 and 3.25% in 2025. This forecast is supported by Morningstar's analysis, which projects rates between 3.75% and 4%. Preparing for Mortgage Rate Changes in the Next Five Years The prospect of fluctuating mortgage rates can be daunting for both prospective homebuyers and current homeowners. With predictions indicating a period of change in the coming years, it's crucial to have a strategy in place to navigate potential rate increases or decreases. Here are some steps to consider when preparing for mortgage rate changes over the next five years: 1. Stay Informed Keeping abreast of economic trends and mortgage rate forecasts can provide valuable insights into when rates might rise or fall. Regularly check reputable financial news sources and consider subscribing to updates from financial institutions. 2. Fixed vs. Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs) If you're concerned about rising rates, locking in a fixed-rate mortgage can provide stability. Conversely, if rates are predicted to fall, an ARM might offer initial savings, though it comes with the risk of rates increasing in the future. 3. Refinancing Opportunities If you already have a mortgage and rates drop, refinancing could lower your monthly payments and overall interest. However, it's important to consider closing costs and how long you plan to stay in your home before making this decision. 4. Budget for Fluctuations If you're in the market for a new home, budget for the possibility of higher rates. This might mean looking at homes below your maximum budget to accommodate potential rate increases. 5. Improve Your Credit Score A higher credit score can help you secure a lower mortgage rate. Take steps to improve your credit by paying down debt, making timely payments, and avoiding new credit inquiries. 6. Save for a Larger Down Payment A larger down payment can reduce your loan-to-value ratio, potentially qualifying you for better rates and terms. 7. Consider Loan Terms Shorter loan terms typically have lower interest rates but higher monthly payments. Determine what loan term aligns with your financial goals and capabilities. 8. Understand Rate Caps For ARMs, understand the rate caps that limit how much your interest rate can change at each adjustment period and over the life of the loan. 9. Government Policies and Programs Stay updated on government policies that may impact mortgage rates, such as changes in the Federal Reserve's policies or housing market regulations. 10. Consult Financial Advisors A financial advisor can offer personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals. They can help you understand the implications of rate changes and the best course of action. By taking these steps, you can position yourself to better handle the ups and downs of mortgage rates. Remember, preparation and knowledge are key to making informed decisions that align with your long-term financial well-being. Now, be informed that it's important to note that these predictions are subject to change based on unforeseen economic shifts, policy changes, and global events. The consensus among experts, however, points to a general trend of declining mortgage rates over the next five years, offering a glimmer of hope for those looking to enter the housing market or refinance their existing mortgages. As we navigate through these uncertain times, staying informed and consulting with financial advisors can help individuals make well-informed decisions regarding their mortgage options. The trajectory of mortgage rates will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the US housing market's future, and by extension, the dreams of countless Americans seeking to own a piece of it.",https://www.noradarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mortgage-rate-predictions-for-the-next-5-years.jpeg,2024-04-16,0.269,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MBA', 'latitude': -1.6971800327301025, 'longitude': 37.618080139160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank of America', 'latitude': 37.79444122314453, 'longitude': -122.40306091308594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Morningstar', 'latitude': 17.758310317993164, 'longitude': -64.76126098632812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ARM', 'latitude': 31.50305938720703, 'longitude': -90.01611328125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ARMs', 'latitude': 49.56684112548828, 'longitude': -85.99992370605469, 'location_type': 'REGION'}]","Fannie Mae predicts a gradual decline in mortgage rates over the next five years, with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage expected to end 2024 at 6.4% and further decline to 5.5% by the end of 2025."

The updated rules will increase inspections at multifamily properties tied to Freddie Mac loans — a move to cut down on inflated rents reflected in the financials sent to lenders, months after price discrepancies pushed Fannie Mae to stop doing business with two title insurers. The government-sponsored enterprise will also increase know-your-customer requirements, particularly around first-time borrowers or borrowers with limited experience. The agency will mandate more disclosures around the borrower’s liquidity. Freddie Mac said it would further provide new processes to limit business with certain title insurance companies. In addition, there will be more requirements to “to safeguard the independence, objectivity and impartiality of appraisers.” The guidelines come after Freddie Mac in November moved to require property owners to send loan documents directly to lenders, bypassing intermediaries like brokers. The guidelines also come amid Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae’s investigation into the commercial brokerage Meridian Capital Group over certain loans. The agencies have essentially blacklisted Meridian while the investigation is ongoing. Fannie Mae stopped doing business with two title insurance companies, Madison Title and Riverside Abstract, for their involvement in Brooklyn real estate investor Boruch Drillman’s deals. Drillman pleaded guilty in December for his role in a $165 million fraud scheme. As part of the scheme, Drillman and his co-conspirators used fake closings with inflated sales prices to obtain larger loans than they would have otherwise received. Madison and Riverside closed two of Drillman’s deals. Madison and Riverside have not been accused of any wrongdoing. Freddie Mac’s role is to provide liquidity to the mortgage market. Historically, more than 90 percent of the rental units the agency funds are affordable to families with low-to moderate incomes.

Today, I have a big market update. This post is designed to skim by topic or digest slowly. UPCOMING SPEAKING GIGS: 4/11/24 Lindsay Carlisle Event (private) 4/25/24 HomeSmart iCare Realty (details TBA) 4/26/24 Prime Real Estate (private) 5/9/24 Empire Home Loans (details TBA) 5/15/24 Investor Meetup (details TBA) 6/6/24 Golden 1 Credit Union (details TBA) 6/11/24 Elk Grove Regional MLS Meeting 8:30am 6/13/24 Sacramento Realtist Association (details TBA) INFLATION IS HOTTER THAN EXPECTED HIGHER RATES MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE Rates ticked up this week, and we could see the effect of that in closed sales in May. But backing up, closed sales volume in March was lackluster in Sacramento because rates went up in February, some buyers backed off, and that led to a lower number of sales in March after those February pendings closed. REALLY LOW MARCH This was the lowest month of March volume since at least 2001. What the? Volume for the year is up from one year ago, but March was lower in almost every single county due to a lower number of pendings in February most likely. The theme for this year is “More in 2024,” and so far for the entire year, we’ve seen more sales, more pendings, and more new listings, but if rates tick up too much, that’s going to interfere with the theme. NOTE: Someone said volume could be lower due to Leap Year at the end of February and then Good Friday to close out the last business day of March. That’s something to consider, and I guess time will help us see the trend. Yet, pending volume was legit lower in February per my stats and even Redfin stats, so we can’t discount that. Any thoughts? Here’s one more way to look at volume. Do you see how the March line sagged? In a normal year we should have seen this line rise much more. PENDINGS ARE WHERE WE SEE THE TREND We see the trend first in the pendings, but it takes a month or so for pending contracts to turn into closed sales. Do you see how February pendings were lackluster? This week mortgage rates spiked again, and if that persists, we could see fewer properties getting into contract. Of course, only time will tell, but an average of 7.37% today can definitely soften demand. NOTE: I’m careful to not get swayed by daily rate changes because it can be so manic from one day to the next. All I’m saying is we need to watch this because if we stay closer to 7.3%, that’s going to soften demand. NEW LISTINGS ARE OUTPACING LAST YEAR The number of new listings is thankfully higher than last year, but it’s still way down from normal. There has NOT been a flood of new listings like some people think. The number of active listings is still low too. Here’s another way to look at new listings. ALMOST NORMAL, BUT NOT QUITE Here’s an image from a presentation I’m giving today. As you can see, we’re more competitive than normal, but we’re way closer to normal than a year like 2021 (thankfully). BRO, SUPPLY IS STILL LOW Supply is still thin – even with more new listings compared to last year. This is a big part of why it still feels competitive out there. We’ve basically seen low supply and low demand meet. That’s a perfect way to describe the trend. COMPETING WITH FINANCED OFFERS & CASH The bulk of properties out there are being financed. That’s what the stats show, but I think the narrative at times says it’s all cash. Keep in mind there is more cash at higher price points. COMPETITIVE, BUT ALSO CLOSER TO NORMAL Here’s a cool way to look at the market. This percentage tells us how close properties sold compared to their original price. Last month, properties basically sold about 0.7% below the original price on average. This is still more competitive than normal, but so much closer to historic norms though too. PRICES HAVE GONE UP FOR THE SPRING SO FAR It’s been a pretty normal spring season so far, and we’re basically seeing all the normal stuff we tend to see with days on market going down, prices going up, more new listings, etc… I’ll have my county images out over the next week, so please see the STATS tab for data for nine counties. For now, here’s a look at the entire region. Keep in mind a 5-7% price metric increase from one year ago doesn’t automatically mean comps today are going to be that much higher. My advice? Look to the comps to understand. VOLUME COMPARED TO ONE YEAR AGO Prices are a bit higher this year, so we’re seeing less sales at lower prices this year (and more at higher prices). This is interesting to see because I find some people say things like, “The top of the market is getting destroyed,” when the stats actually don’t support that narrative. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS TICKED UP Unemployment is not at alarming levels, but we want to watch the trend. Here’s a look at the unemployment rate in a number of local counties. And I know the second image is a hot mess, but I wanted to show how some smaller counties look on a graph (much more erratic). FINANCING SINCE 2009 If you wanted to see what buyer financing and cash sales look like since 2009, you’re in luck. Hopefully your life is now complete. MORE COMPETITIVE THAN DOOM PROPHETS ARE SAYING Stats show it’s been more competitive than the pre-2020 normal, but not by too much though. It’s nothing like 2021 out there thankfully. Yet, it’s not a walk in the park. I think many people who perpetuate housing doom are actually quite disconnected with how competitive it is right now. In short, the good stuff goes quickly, and getting multiple offers is very common still. But getting 10 offers and going 10% over value is not the dynamic today. Granted, if you are priced 10% too low, you’re going to get bid up most likely. That’s what happens when pricing low. Anyway, more out on my socials this week. This post is getting too long.

At issue is a National Association of Realtors settlement that is expected to result in sellers no longer having to pay the commissions of buyers' real estate agents in conjunction with multiple listing services, but rather through other arrangements. The settlement has raised concerns about how the changes affect limits the two major government-related loan buyers have on seller contributions to borrowers' closing costs, which max out in a range of 2% to 9% of a property's value, depending on what's typical for an area. The two government-sponsored enterprises generally take a path similar to that of the Federal Housing Administration in their clarifications, noting that they won't count buyer fees toward limits on contributions so long as they are in line with the regional norm. ""If a seller or seller's real estate agent continues to pay the buyer's real estate agent in accordance with local common and customary practices, these amounts are not required to be counted toward the IPC limits for the transaction,"" Fannie said in a selling notice. Freddie issued a similar statement in an industry letter, noting, ""If these fees continue to be customarily paid by the property seller according to local convention, they will not be subject to financing concessions limits."" Both government-sponsored enterprises also mirrored the FHA in that they left the door open to make future changes to the policy as the Burnett et al. and Moehrl et al. cases play out. ""We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the proposed NAR settlement and other real estate agent commission lawsuits to determine if any updates of our requirements are necessary,"" Freddie said. Fannie used similar language, noting that it will keep following the lawsuits and ""evaluate the potential implications to the mortgage industry."" It said that its current clarification does not constitute a formal selling-guide change. Meanwhile, the question of how the Department of Veterans Affairs will handle potential changes to buyer real estate commissions was still outstanding at the time of this writing. Borrowers can't directly pay buyer commissions under VA's policy for the loans it partially guarantees, and that's more likely to be a scenario in homebuying going forward given changes contemplated as a result of recent legal developments. In a recent letter to the department, the National Association of Realtors urged the VA to allow the commissions amid the changes to the landscape to ensure borrowers with guaranteed loans can make competitive offers for homes in a market with a supply shortage. ""Where no offer of compensation is offered from a seller, VA buyers are immediately at a disadvantage, potentially forcing them to forgo professional representation, lose a property in an already limited inventory, choose a different loan product, or exit the market,"" the NAR said. The VA has been in consultation with the Department of Justice in regard to how to address the issue given a recent DoJ ruling has raised the potential for tweaks to the National Association of Realtors settlement.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/57/17/6c136a1140e7b6306759e4008863/fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac.png,2024-04-16,-0.217,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Burnett', 'latitude': 47.12944030761719, 'longitude': -122.04778289794922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NAR', 'latitude': 57.25727844238281, 'longitude': 18.625089645385742, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Department of Justice', 'latitude': 14.579360008239746, 'longitude': 120.98387145996094, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Fannie Mae clarified its policies regarding interested party contributions in response to legal developments concerning real estate commissions.

The Great Demotech Scare of 2022: A Catalyst for Change in the Florida Insurance Market - Bankrate.com,The Great Demotech Scare of 2022: A Catalyst for Change in the Florida Insurance Market  Bankrate.com,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 18:53:54 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtyYXRlLmNvbS9pbnN1cmFuY2UvaG9tZW93bmVycy1pbnN1cmFuY2UvZGVtb3RlY2gtZG93bmdyYWRlcy1mbG9yaWRhLW1hcmtldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Bankrate.com,"The summer of 2022 has been one of uncertainty for millions of homeowners in Florida. Rampant fraud, excessive litigation and a worsening climate have sent the Florida property insurance market into a tailspin. With news that 27 of Florida’s property insurance companies may be facing a financial rating downgrade, Florida homeowners brace themselves for the possibility of scrambling for new coverage in the middle of what scientists predict to be an active hurricane season. The Florida Legislature held a special session in May to tackle the issues in the Florida property insurance market, and as a result, they passed Senate Bill 2D. Although the provisions in this bill are promising, Florida homeowners face another new potential hurdle, as financial rating firm Demotech announced in late July that they are likely to downgrade the financial rating for 27 Florida homeowners insurance companies. Bankrate has investigated what these financial rating downgrades mean for Florida homeowners so that they can best prepare themselves for the uncertain future that may lie ahead. What is a financial rating downgrade? Financial analysis and ratings agencies like A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Demotech assign ratings to insurers based on their financial strength, called financial ratings or financial stability ratings (FSR). The FSR of an insurance company indicates its historical ability to pay out covered claims. While it’s essential that an insurance company can pay out claims when needed, your insurance company’s financial rating could also affect your mortgage. If your mortgage is federally-backed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae and your insurance company is rated by Demotech, that company must have an FSR of A or higher. If not, you run the risk of force-placed insurance. Which Florida property insurance companies are being downgraded? Since this process is confidential, knowing which companies are affected is impossible until the downgrade is official. As it stands, Demotech may downgrade the FSR of 27 Florida property insurance companies. On August 1, 2022, Demotech downgraded the FSR for United Property and Casualty Insurance (UPC) from an A to M. Demotech signaled that it would withdraw UPC’s FSR, and in response, UPC withdrew its business from Florida, Texas and Louisiana on August 25, 2022. UPC stated that they plan on withdrawing from New York, as well. Additionally, Demotech withdrew the FSRs for Weston Property Insurance and FedNat. Weston Property Insurance then declared insolvency on August 4, 2022. Often, a rating withdrawal can be the first step toward bankruptcy. Bankers Specialty Insurance and First Community Insurance (which shares the parent company Bankers Insurance Group) had its ratings withdrawn on August 3, 2022. Like UPC, Bankers Insurance Group then pulled its business out of Florida. What is being done to address the rating downgrades? As a stopgap measure, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) announced that state-backed Citizens would provide reinsurance for companies affected by Demotech’s downgrades. In essence, the OIR is using Citizens to insure downgraded companies if they do not have enough funds to pay for covered claims. According to OIR, this reinsurance plan should provide relief for homeowners by satisfying Freddie Mac’s and Fannie Mae’s insurance requirements. Whether Citizens can handle the extra strain remains to be seen. Because so many insurers are issuing non-renewals (or fleeing the state altogether), Citizens is the only option for many homeowners. In 2021, Citizens saw a 37.7% increase in new business and had nearly one million policyholders as of July 2022. This influx of new business and the added responsibility of providing a financial stopgap for downgraded insurers could prove problematic for Citizens. Mark Friedlander, Director of Corporate Communication for the Insurance Information Institute (Triple-I), says, Citizens is financially solid but its reserves appear to be inadequate for incurring significant storm activity. As of July 15, Citizens has $311 billion in exposure but only has the ability to pay about $11.3 billion in claims. If the 2022 hurricane season proves to be as severe as many climate scientists predict, Citizens and Floridian homeowners alike could be facing unprecedented hardship. How will the Citizens stopgap affect Florida premiums? Citizens is a not-for-profit insurance company created by the state of Florida in 2002. State law allows Citizens to obtain funding through policyholder premiums and in some circumstances, a statewide assessment. Florida law requires that Citizens impose fees on most Florida homeowners policies if they experience a deficit due to a catastrophe, regardless if Citizens holds the policy or not. This assessment is sometimes called the “hurricane tax,” and it can be levied on all auto, condo, renters and homeowners policies in Florida. For Citizens customers, this fee is capped at 15% per policy. For those insured elsewhere, the fee can be up to 2% of your total premium. If Citizens ends up in a deficit after providing claims payouts to downgraded companies, it’s possible that nearly all Florida residents with insurance will pay a higher premium to help rebuild the company’s claims reserves. Demotech responds to criticism On July 21, 2022, Florida’s insurance commissioner David Altmaier issued a letter to Demotech that questioned whether the company applied their methodologies in a fair and consistent manner. Bankrate had the opportunity to correspond with Demotech president Joe Petrelli. In response to Altmaier, Petrelli says, Recently, there has been unfair criticism of Demotech based on incomplete, premature, or misleading information about our ratings process. Petrelli also takes issue with the portrayal of the downgrade process. He went on to say, “These characterizations were an inaccurate depiction of our published process and rating methodology, most significantly because they portrayed preliminary letters as if they were final, when our process – the same comprehensive process we have used for years – involves a continual review of relevant data. The ratings process is an ongoing effort that takes into account a variety of internal and external considerations. Demotech uses a variety of factors to develop ratings assessments, including the following company information: quantity and quality of reinsurance; liquidity of assets; degree of leverage (liabilities compared to equity and premium); ability to properly estimate and reserve for claims; and operating environment (regulations, litigation, weather, etc.). We continue to review insurer data even after preliminary letters are sent, and this ongoing process sometimes results in a different rating action than initially indicated.” What happens if your property insurance company is downgraded? If your homeowners insurance company is downgraded, it is legally required to give you 30 days notice. If you receive a downgrade letter in the mail, here’s what you need to know: For now, no action is needed If Demotech downgrades your homeowners insurance company, there is nothing you need to do at this time. The OIR states that the Citizens Insurance stopgap will meet mortgage requirements. You can shop for new property insurance If your homeowners insurance company is downgraded, you can try to shop for new Florida homeowners insurance. Be aware, however, that the Florida property insurance market is challenged, and it may be hard to find an insurance company willing to take on new business. Additionally, since Demotech doesn’t announce downgrades until they happen, it’s possible to switch from one downgraded company to one marked for a downgrade in the future. Simply put, there’s no guarantee that you will be in a better position if you switch. What to do if you can’t find insurance As stated, you should not have to shop for new insurance if Demotech downgrades your current company. Many Floridians, however, are also receiving non-renewal notices from their property insurance companies. If you are being non-renewed, you have to obtain new coverage before your non-renewal date. Failure to do so will result in a lapse of coverage and possible consequences from your mortgage company. If you are having trouble finding a property insurance company in Florida that will offer you a policy, you may want to consider Citizens. Citizens is not a take-all-comers company, which means they can deny coverage. Still, they have a history of writing policies for many Floridians who other companies have rejected. The bottom line The Florida homeowners insurance market continues to hobble along, as evidenced by Demotech’s financial rating downgrades. Initially, it was unknown how these downgrades would affect Florida homeowners but for now, a stopgap measure through state-run Citizens has been imposed. If you are insured with a downgraded company, you should not have to shop for new insurance (provided that the company is still solvent). In reality, this stopgap measure is not likely to be the end of the Florida homeowner’s insurance crisis of 2022. Mark Friedlander went on to say, Compared to past turbulent markets, which were caused by hurricane property losses, the current crisis is completely man-made: a result of rampant roof replacement fraud schemes and excessive litigation filed against insurers. It is not the result of catastrophic weather events. Until the state passes effective legislation to address the core issues — fraud and frivolous litigation — Floridians will continue to pay the price.",https://www.bankrate.com/2022/08/25163416/Demotech-downgrades-what-they-might-mean-for-Florida-property-insurance-market.jpg,2022-08-25,-0.189,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'A.M.

Real estate CEO: Fed move 'very encouraging' - Yahoo Movies Canada,Real estate CEO: Fed move 'very encouraging'  Yahoo Movies Canada,"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 04:38:40 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtY2VvLWZlZC1tb3ZlLTIyMzA1Mjk1Ni5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Movies Canada,"Wednesday was a historic day with the Federal Reserve opting to raise target interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. The move may make some types of borrowing more expensive and put some prices under pressure. But with a limited effect on mortgages, the housing market shouldn't necessarily worry — indeed, the move might even be a good thing, one expert told CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""A modest move in rates because of a good economy, which is really the messaging around this move, I think is very encouraging,"" said Douglas Yearley, director and CEO of luxury housing company Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL). ""We're actually thinking that this is going to bring out some pent-up demand, it's actually going to move some demand in, and we're pretty optimistic about where we go."" When Wells Fargo raised its prime rate Wednesday, for instance, it told CNBC that a change in the federal funds rate will have no impact on the interest rates on existing fixed-rate mortgages and other fixed-rate consumer loans. At 4 percent, 30-year fixed rates, which is what Yearley focuses on, are less than 1 percentage point higher than their record low. And Yearley doesn't expect them to crawl higher as quickly as the short-term rates. To be sure, in the luxury market, mortgage rates are less of a determining factor, Yearley said. But Zillow, a real estate listing company, put out a report this week claiming that 70 percent of potential homebuyers it surveyed nationwide said they would not abandon their buying plans if mortgage rates were to hit 4.5 percent. ""There are still plenty of families, in their 30s, in their 40s, that ... are still looking to move up,"" Yearley said. ""They've been on the sidelines now for a better part of a decade, and we have a lot of demand for those houses still."" That optimistic sentiment was echoed by Timothy Mayopoulos, CEO of mortgage loan company Fannie Mae. But other reforms on the horizon do bode to have a bigger impact on the mortgage industry, Mayopoulos told ""Closing Bell"" Thursday. An omnibus spending bill in Congress includes provisions prohibits the Treasury Department from selling the government's stake in mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac until 2018 without future legislation, according to The Wall Street Journal. ""There's lots and lots of positive reform that's already happened,"" Mayopoulos said. ""I actually think it's good that policymakers are getting back into focusing on what needs to happen to finish the reform process."" Despite a changing regulatory landscape, Mayopoulos said that people remain committed to Fannie Mae's mission to make affordable housing and rentals available to millions of people. ""I think a slower, more deliberate process is important,"" Mayopoulos said. — CNBC's Diana Olick contributed to this report.

Image caption: Click n’ Close, Inc. “It’s no secret that the combination of rising interest rates, limited inventory and growing property appreciation have made it more difficult for potential homebuyers to purchase in today’s market. While existing homeowners have benefitted tremendously from skyrocketing home equity, that same trend has put buyers at a tremendous disadvantage,” said Click n’ Close Owner and CEO Jeff Bode. “By combining our proprietary DPA programs with a shared appreciation option, we’re not only helping buyers get into a home more easily but also reap the benefit of homeownership from day one.” Click n’ Close’s DPA with Shared Appreciation program offers a below-market interest rate for first-lien FHA and USDA loans and a repayable DPA second lien in exchange for up to 40% the home’s appreciation during the first five years. After the five-year accumulation period, the shared appreciation amount is added to the second lien and amortized over the remaining term. Program rates start at 4.75% for a 5-1 adjustable rate mortgage (ARM). DPA with Share Appreciation is available through Click n’ Close’s retail and wholesale divisions.

Mortgage costs have retreated more than 110 basis points over the last three months since the peak of 7.79% in October. That trend is boosting hopes for improved affordability as rates are poised to drop despite this week's minor climb. While rates are still hovering around mid-6% — significantly higher than the average in 2021 and 2022 — consumers are becoming increasingly active in the housing market. More buyers are applying for mortgages, signifying a belief that home prices will retreat along with mortgage rates. ""We do have home sales, and particularly existing home sales, [forecasted] to pick up around 4% this year,"" Mark Palim, vice president and deputy chief economist at Fannie Mae, told Yahoo Finance. ""We have a little bit higher of a pickup in 2025, by nearly 14%, because by then, the lower mortgage rates would have worked their way through the system."" Read more: Mortgage rates below 7% — is this a good time to buy a house? Homebuyers see a glimmer of hope Homebuyers are trickling back into the housing market as the level of mortgage applications increased by 3.7% from a week prior, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) in its weekly survey ending Jan. 19. The seasonally adjusted purchase index — measuring new home loans — jumped 8% week over week. However, the unadjusted purchase index remains 18% lower than the same week a year ago, and refinance activity is also 16% lower than the previous week. ""Conventional and FHA purchase applications drove most of the increase last week as some buyers moved to act early this season,"" said Joel Kan, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist. ""Refinance applications declined over the week and remained at low levels. There is still little incentive for homeowners to refinance with rates at these levels."" Read more: Mortgage refinancing: How to get started An upswing in buyers' mortgage activity paralleled an increase in homebuyers' confidence. Americans are feeling more optimistic about the housing market, according to the latest Home Purchase Sentiment Index (HPSI) surveyed by Fannie Mae in December. The share of respondents believing now is a ""good time"" to buy a home increased three percentage points to 17% from 14% a month earlier. Economists attributed the growing positivity to consumers' belief that mortgage rates will fall — bringing home prices with them. ""Mortgage rate optimism increased dramatically this month, with a survey-high share of consumers anticipating mortgage rate declines over the next year,"" Palim said. ""A more optimistic rate outlook among consumers may signal an expectation that home affordability pressures will ease in 2024."" Rates projected to drop below 6% by year-end Economists at Fannie Mae predicted that slowing economic growth in 2024 will bring rates down to around 5.8% by the end of the year. ""Part of [the rate cut] is the slow growth that we see across this year, and part of it is the Fed easing,"" Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. ""We do have [the expectation of] the Fed cutting rates four times this year."" But the first cut may come later than expected. Consumer prices increased 0.3% month-over-month and 3.4% annually in December. Overall price growth remained higher than the Fed's targeted 2% even after last year’s rate hikes, suggesting that inflation is stickier than previously thought.

Is the Housing Market Going to Crash? - Norada Real Estate Investments,Is the Housing Market Going to Crash?  Norada Real Estate Investments,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 13:44:24 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcmFkYXJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tL2Jsb2cvaXMtdGhlLWhvdXNpbmctbWFya2V0LWdvaW5nLXRvLWNyYXNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Norada Real Estate Investments,"The housing market is a complex and dynamic system influenced by various economic factors, policies, and consumer behaviors. As of 2024, the question of whether the housing market will crash is on the minds of many, from potential homebuyers to economic analysts. While the housing market has shown signs of stagnation with existing home sales at their lowest since 2010 and mortgage demand dropping significantly, most experts do not anticipate a crash in 2024. Factors such as average mortgage rates remaining more than double compared to 2020 and 2021, and home prices staying high, have contributed to this sluggish activity. However, despite these challenges and the possibility of a recession, the consensus among housing experts is that the market will likely come back into balance without a crash. Several experts have identified signs of a potential housing bubble since 2022, but the increase in home prices was attributed to factors other than speculation or credit expansion, such as low mortgage rates and a shift in housing demand. This suggests that while the market is under pressure, it may not be headed for a crash as seen in previous economic downturns. Others forecast a slower rise in home prices in 2024 compared to recent years, with fluctuations depending on regional market supply and demand. Business Insider echoes this sentiment, indicating that economists do not expect a housing market crash in 2024 or beyond, with home prices projected to increase modestly. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, expects a slight decrease in home prices by 2 percent in 2024, suggesting a correction rather than a crash. Similarly, The Guardian reports that most property companies predict small declines in home prices in 2024, with a return to growth expected in 2025. The housing market predictions for the second quarter of 2024 suggest a slight increase in home prices, with high demand persisting despite a low supply. Mortgage rates, while still on the higher side, could see a dip by the end of the quarter, providing some relief to potential homebuyers. Fannie Mae's forecast also aligns with this outlook, expecting an increase in home sales transactions compared to the previous year. However, the rise in home prices is anticipated to be slower, with regional fluctuations heavily dependent on local market supply and demand. Zillow's economists predict that home buyers will have more options and a bit more affordability in 2024, following the inventory crunch and mortgage rate hikes that dominated the previous year's news. This suggests a market that is adjusting to the new economic realities, offering opportunities for buyers who can navigate the high-rate environment. It's evident that while the housing market faces headwinds, it is not uniformly heading towards a downturn. Instead, certain areas are thriving, and others are adjusting to create a more balanced market. For prospective buyers and investors, these trends underscore the importance of regional research and staying abreast of the latest developments to make informed decisions in a shifting landscape. Factors That Could Prevent a Crash in the Housing Market Here are some of the important factors that could prevent a crash in the US housing market this year. 1. Stringent Lending Standards One of the key factors contributing to the stability of the housing market is the stringent lending standards that have been in place since the last financial crisis. These standards have ensured that borrowers are more qualified and less likely to default on their loans, creating a healthier environment for mortgage lending. 2. Homeowner Equity Another significant factor is the overall healthier balance sheet among homeowners. Many homeowners have built up substantial equity in their homes, which acts as a buffer against market fluctuations. This equity accumulation means that even if property values were to decline, many homeowners would still have equity, reducing the likelihood of widespread foreclosures. 3. Cautious Building Practices Builders have also adopted a more cautious approach in recent years, focusing on demand-driven construction rather than speculative building. This has helped prevent the over-supply issues that contributed to the housing market crash in 2008. 4. Demographic Demand The strong housing demand from millennials, who are now entering their prime home-buying years, is another factor that supports the market. This demographic shift is expected to create a sustained demand for housing, particularly as this age group seeks to own homes and start families. 5. Limited Housing Supply The limited housing supply, partly due to slower building rates and supply chain disruptions, has also played a role in maintaining home values. While this has posed challenges for affordability, it has also prevented a sudden drop in home prices that could trigger a market crash. 6. Economic Recovery and Job Market Strength The broader economic recovery and the strength of the job market are also crucial. A strong job market means more people can afford to buy homes, which supports housing demand and prices. Moreover, as the economy recovers, consumer confidence tends to increase, which can further bolster the housing market. 7. Policy Interventions Finally, policy interventions by the government and federal agencies can play a pivotal role in stabilizing the housing market. Measures such as interest rate adjustments, homeowner assistance programs, and housing market regulations can help mitigate the risk of a crash by addressing affordability and preventing speculative bubbles. Therefore, while the housing market is not immune to fluctuations, several factors in 2024 are working in tandem to prevent a crash. From stringent lending practices to demographic demand and limited supply, these elements contribute to a more balanced and resilient housing market. Factors That Could Lead to a Housing Market Crash While the US housing market has shown resilience, there are several factors that could lead to a crash as discussed below. 1. Rising Interest Rates One of the most significant factors that could contribute to a housing market crash is the rise in interest rates. The Federal Reserve has been increasing rates in an effort to combat inflation. Higher interest rates make mortgages more expensive, which can reduce the demand for home buying and put downward pressure on home prices. 2. Inflation and Eroding Purchasing Power Inflation, which has been at a 40-year high, erodes consumers' purchasing power. This means that even if incomes rise, the increased cost of living can make it more difficult for people to afford homes. If inflation continues to outpace income growth, it could lead to a decrease in home affordability and demand. 3. Potential Recession Economists have warned that the US economy may be headed for a recession in 2024. A recession typically leads to higher unemployment rates and lower consumer confidence, which can result in decreased demand for housing. This, in turn, can cause home prices to fall. 4. High Mortgage Rates and Inflated Home Values The combination of high mortgage rates and inflated home values can also be a precursor to a housing market crash. If homeowners are unable to afford their mortgage payments due to rising rates, it could lead to an increase in foreclosures. Additionally, if home values decline, homeowners may find themselves with negative equity, which can further exacerbate the situation. 5. Scarcity of Inventory While a limited housing supply has been supporting home prices, a sudden increase in inventory without a corresponding rise in demand could lead to a market crash. If builders respond to the current demand by rapidly increasing supply, it could create an oversupply that the market cannot absorb, leading to falling prices. 6. Household Debt Another factor to consider is the level of household debt, which has surpassed $17 trillion. Mortgages, credit cards, and student loans make up a significant portion of this debt. If households are stretched too thin financially, any economic downturn could lead to a wave of defaults and foreclosures. 7. Shifts in Disposable Income and Access to Credit Changes in disposable income and access to credit are also important factors. If disposable income decreases or if credit becomes more difficult to obtain, it could reduce the number of potential homebuyers in the market. This reduction in demand could lead to a decrease in home prices. 8. Rising Labor and Construction Material Costs Finally, rising labor and construction material costs can impact the housing market. If the cost of building new homes becomes too high, it could slow down new construction and limit the supply of new homes. This could initially support prices but could also lead to a bubble if demand decreases and supply suddenly increases. In summary, while the housing market faces challenges such as high mortgage rates, elevated home prices, and low housing stock, the majority of experts do not foresee a crash in 2024. Instead, they anticipate a market correction with a gradual balancing of supply and demand.",https://www.noradarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/is-the-housing-market-going-to-crash.jpeg,2024-04-16,0.146,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Morgan Stanley', 'description': 'U.S investment bank', 'full_name': 'Morgan Stanley', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Morgan-stanley-building.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Zillow', 'description': 'online real estate database', 'full_name': 'Zillow', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Zillow_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'The Guardian', 'latitude': 37.66360855102539, 'longitude': -107.54033660888672, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Access', 'latitude': 38.209251403808594, 'longitude': -83.07100677490234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not-related content.
Is AI in the Mortgage Industry? - ConsumerAffairs,Is AI in the Mortgage Industry?

Customer service Chatbots are hardly a new concept, but they are a good reminder of the use of AI with customer service inquiries. Lenders can now use AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants to provide more personalized assistance to borrowers by answering specific questions, offering guidance through the application process or facilitating communication with lenders. Tailored loan recommendations AI has the capability to recommend individual loan options for potential borrowers. It not only factors in personal financial information, such as income and spending habits, but also it can incorporate risk tolerance so a borrower receives a much more personalized loan recommendation. This can offer a helpful solution during the application process because it may suggest loan options that someone might be unaware of. Documentation review AI can assist with the documentation review portion of the loan application process, including automating the review of paystubs, bank statements and other documents. It can make quicker work of the submission process, which the borrower may appreciate, and can potentially reduce the number of human errors on the lender’s side. Creditworthiness assessment AI can use algorithms to assess a borrower’s creditworthiness in more advanced ways compared to the traditional underwriting process of relying on a credit score. Not only can AI analyze credit history, income and debt-to-income ratios, it can drill down even further. AI can analyze a borrower’s spending patterns, social media behaviors and bill payment history to form a more robust picture of a borrower’s financial habits. Using AI to create a well-rounded applicant profile can potentially benefit borrowers as well, since it may increase approval odds based on other factors outside the traditional approval parameters. Underwriting The use of automated underwriting is not a completely new concept, but more lenders may choose to adopt this approach as AI gains in popularity. For example, Fannie Mae uses a proprietary program called Desktop Underwriter for its underwriting process, which provides faster data validation which in turn can make the underwriting process more efficient. Fraud detection and compliance Whether a borrower is taking out a new mortgage or refinancing, AI can assist lenders in looking for application anomalies or red flags that might indicate fraudulent activity. AI can do this by analyzing any inconsistencies in applications, such as with employment verification, instances of identity theft or inflated income statements. Additionally, the mortgage industry is subject to a long list of regulations, which can make it harder for lenders to stay compliant. AI can help streamline the reporting process lenders face by automating much of the reporting. » MORE: 9 mortgage questions to ask your lender",https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/caimages/is-ai-in-the-mortgage-industry-desk.jpg,2024-04-16,0.166,[],Not-related content.
GSEs will not count buyer agent commissions in cap on seller concessions - HousingWire,GSEs will not count buyer agent commissions in cap on seller concessions  HousingWire,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 07:26:11 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9nc2VzLXdpbGwtbm90LWNvdW50LWJ1eWVyLWFnZW50LWNvbW1pc3Npb25zLWFzLWlwY3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will not count buyer’s agent commissions as part of their allowable interested party contributions (IPCs), according to announcements from the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) on Monday. The GSEs noted that this guidance was not an update to their selling guides but a clarification on the treatment of seller-paid real estate agent fees. Based on the selling guides in use by the GSEs, property sellers are allowed to make financing concessions toward the borrower’s closing costs at a maximum amount of 2% to 9% of the property value. In their guidance issued on Monday, the GSEs note that “fees or costs customarily paid by the property seller according to local convention are not subject to these financing concessions limits.” “Buyer agent fees have historically been fees customarily paid by the property seller or property seller’s real estate agent, and, as such, they are currently excluded from these financing concession limits,” according to the statement from Freddie Mac. Moving forward, the GSEs say that if these fees continue to be “customarily paid by the property seller according to local convention, they will not be subject to financing concessions limits.” These clarifications come after the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reached a nationwide settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the commission lawsuits. If the settlement is approved by the court, although agents and home sellers will not be able to list offers of compensation on the MLS, home sellers may still offer to cover the buyer’s agent fees if they so choose. In late March, NAR and the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) sent a letter to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director Sandra Thompson, Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar, Freddie Mac CEO Michael DeVito, and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Commissioner Julia Gordon asking for the officials to confirm their treatment of IPCs to home purchase transactions. On a recent episode of NextHome CEO James Dwiggins and chief strategy officer Keith Robinson’s podcast “Real Estate Insiders Unfiltered,” NAR president Kevin Sears announced that he received confirmation from Gordon that, per FHA policy, if sellers continue to pay buyer broker commissions and fees as a manner of state and local laws or customs, and if these expenses are reasonable in amount, the existing policy would not treat those payments as interested party contributions. NAR has also reached out to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs seeking similar guidance on VA loans, but Sears said that letter remains unanswered. Despite this, NAR was glad to see the news from the GSEs. “NAR is pleased to see that our letter in collaboration with the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) regarding the Interested Party Contributions (IPCs) garnered a timely response from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,” Mantill Williams, NAR’s vice president of communications, wrote in an email. The Community Home Lenders Association (CHLA) expressed support for the GSEs’ announcement. ”CHLA appreciates Fannie Mae’s clarification today that seller payment of buyer realtor commissions will not be counted towards seller concession caps,” a spokesperson wrote in an email. “CHLA wrote Fannie Mae, along with all of the federal mortgage program regulators, in December to ask for exactly this type of action to protect first time homebuyers in the wake of emerging realtor lawsuits which may shift the responsibility to buy a buyer’s broker from the seller to the buyer.” The American Real Estate Association (AREA), a startup trade organization, also was pleased by Monday’s announcement. “Today’s statement regarding seller commission compensation was well-received,” wrote Jason Haber, the co-founder of AREA. “Next, we hope Fannie will provide a similar framework for buyers. Will buyer payments for their own professional services count against the IPC cap? That remains an open question at this time.”",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1200x700_Freddie_Mac.jpg,2024-04-15,-0.109,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Keith Robinson', 'description': 'American actor', 'full_name': 'Keith Robinson', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Keith_robinson_2020.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NAR', 'latitude': 57.25727844238281, 'longitude': 18.625089645385742, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MBA', 'latitude': -1.6971800327301025, 'longitude': 37.618080139160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Gordon', 'latitude': -37.70000076293945, 'longitude': 175.8333282470703, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sears', 'latitude': 38.947898864746094, 'longitude': -77.07991027832031, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CHLA', 'latitude': 45.549720764160156, 'longitude': 41.96305847167969, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'AREA', 'latitude': -8.642800331115723, 'longitude': 122.02369689941406, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae announced that buyer's agent commissions will not be counted as part of their allowable interested party contributions (IPCs), clarifying that these fees are typically paid by the seller and are not subject to financing concession limits."

Go deeper: MBA has called on the GSEs, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify possible guideline clarifications or changes that may be needed because of new real estate agent compensation arrangements that may arise from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) commissions litigation and the recently announced settlement. • Following the details of the settlement announced in March, MBA sent a joint letter with NAR to leadership at FHA, FHFA, and the GSEs that asked for confirmation that their policies will continue to exclude seller or listing agent payment of buyer agents’ commission from IPCs.• FHA last month also confirmed that “under existing FHA policy, if sellers continue to pay buyer-side real estate agent commissions and fees as a matter of state or local law or local custom, and if the commissions and fees are reasonable in amount, existing policy would not treat those payments as interested party contributions provided all other requirements are met.” What’s next: MBA will continue its advocacy on this issue with the VA and Rural Housing Service. • In addition, MBA urged the VA in an April 3 letter to expedite regulatory changes to its rule that prohibits Veterans and active-duty service members from paying any portion of brokerage commission when purchasing a home with a VA mortgage. Failure to do so would put VA buyers at a significant disadvantage – especially in today’s tight inventory market.• MBA is also assessing other changes that may be needed in agency guides and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rules to ensure any new agent compensation arrangements do not limit access or raise the cost of mortgages.

(April 11, 2024) – Gantry, the largest independent commercial mortgage banking firm in the U.S., has secured a $40.5 million permanent loan to retire construction financing for the recently completed and now stabilized class-A apartment project. The 264-unit complex boasts a variety of floorplans, including 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom options, spread across 23 buildings nestled on approximately 17 acres of land. The property also includes a clubhouse offering a pool, therapeutic hot tub, sauna, 24/7 fitness center, and theater room as well as a sports court, playground, and off-leash dog park. Gantry’s Blake Hering, Principal, and Crischell Bacarro, Associate, with Gantry’s Portland and Los Angeles production offices, respectively, represented the borrower, a private real estate investor. The 5-year, interest-only agency loan was provided by Fannie Mae via Walker & Dunlop with an attractive fixed rate. According to Gantry’s Blake Hering, “The apartment project was successfully stabilized following its delivery in 2023, and our team was able to secure an optimized permanent loan for the sponsor to retire the project’s maturing construction financing. Multifamily properties hold a primary allocation target status among the majority of Gantry’s debt capital providers, and this requirement, as all client requirements, was engaged in discussions with a diverse range of capital sources. It became clear after this survey that an agency loan best met an experienced sponsor’s legacy hold investment plans.” About GantryAt Gantry, independent thinking is in our genes. As a privately held firm, we take an intentional approach to everything we do. So, as our industry consolidates and becomes less personal, we push ourselves to ignore convention, to set a high standard and to always prioritize people ahead of profits. With over 30 years of experience of loan production and managing an $18 billion national servicing portfolio, our firm leverages a well-established correspondent-driven platform to construct the best financing solutions for our clients.

The study, which has yet to undergo peer review but has been published online, indicates that most of these insurers are financially weak, falling short of federal guidelines required to back mortgaged homes. This raises concerns about the accuracy of ratings that may lead consumers to perceive these insurers as healthier than they are. The focus on Florida’s insurance market reveals a huge reliance on about 50 small insurers, covering 70% of policyholders, often rated by a single entity, Demotech Inc. The study underscores the consequences of relying on a single rating agency, especially after a public dispute in 2022 involving Demotech’s threat to downgrade 17 companies. The potential downgrade could have impacted the state’s housing market and led to challenges for policyholders. Comparing Demotech’s ratings to those of AM Best, a more established ratings company, the study found discrepancies. While Demotech’s “A” rating equates to AM Best’s “B” or “B+”, the study suggests that many of Demotech’s A-rated insurers would not meet the eligibility criteria of mortgage giants like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if rated by AM Best. These findings raise concerns about the reliability of rating agencies and the potential for rating shopping among lower-quality insurers. The study highlights the need for greater scrutiny and independent evaluations of insurers’ financial health, especially in disaster-prone areas like Florida. Despite the risks associated with small insurers, the study notes that Florida regulators have been relatively lax in their oversight. Recommendations from the survey include requiring insurers to be rated by multiple agencies and implementing programs to incentivize insurers to improve their ratings over time. While some lawmakers and regulators have acknowledged these risks, concrete actions based on the study’s recommendations have yet to materialize. The study’s findings underscore the ongoing challenges in Florida’s insurance market and the importance of robust regulatory measures to protect consumers and ensure the market’s stability.",https://www.theartistree.fm/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Harvard-University.jpg,2024-04-17,0.049,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'AM Best', 'description': 'company', 'full_name': 'A.

But there are many reasons for an analyst downgrade. Sometimes a stock has risen so much that the analyst believes it is no longer a good value relative to its price. At other times, competition, a perceived downturn in the general economy, or the resignation of a longtime insider who has known a company may lead the analyst to believe that a company is unlikely to perform well in the coming months. Whatever the reason, the usual result of a downgrade is a decline in the stock price. But the decline could be temporary as the company develops new businesses, economic forecasts improve or new leadership proves its worth. Take a look at three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that just received downgrades from analysts and some of the concerns that justified these decisions. TPG RE Finance Trust Inc. (NYSE:TRTX), a subsidiary of TPG Real Estate, is a mortgage REIT with a portfolio of $4.2 billion of first mortgage loans with an average loan size of $71.6 million, in geographically diversified primary and select secondary markets in the U.S. . On February 20, TPG RE Finance Trust reported its fourth quarter operating results. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.05 was above the estimate of $0.17. Revenue of $31.49 million was higher than estimates of $24.73 million, but lower than fourth-quarter 2022 revenue of $35.99 million. Do not miss it: Despite the less than favorable earnings report, earnings expectations were positive and investors continued to support the stock. Year-to-date, TPG RE Finance has achieved a total return of 16.33%. On April 12, Raymond James analyst Stephen Laws downgraded TPG RE Finance Trust from Strong Buy to Outperform, while keeping the price target at $8.50. This is still above the consensus one-year average price target of $7.90. Arbor Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:ABR) is a Long Island-based mortgage REIT (mREIT) that originates bridge and mezzanine loans for commercial and residential real estate. Many of the loans come from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. Arbor Realty Trust generates profits from the spread between the financing costs of the loan and the interest earned on that loan. Many of Arbor Realty Trust’s commercial loans are short-term first mortgage loans with higher interest rates. Arbor Realty’s mid-February quarterly report was somewhat mixed. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.51 beat the consensus estimate of $0.44 per share, but were 15% lower than fourth quarter 2022 earnings per share of $0.60. Revenue of $103.58 million also surpassed the consensus estimate of $97.65 million, but fell from $113.06 million in the fourth quarter. 2022. The story continues On April 11, Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless downgraded Arbor Realty Trust from Outperform to Neutral and lowered the price target 23.5% from $17 to $13. McCanless is concerned about the longer interest rates and the resulting risks Arbor Realty will face due to increased delinquencies and non-performing loans. He also sees opportunities for a lower loan volume. The analyst lowered the 2024 EPS estimate from $1.95 to $1.80. Popular Clipper Real Estate Inc. (NYSE:CLPR) is a small, New York-based, self-managed and self-managed REIT that owns, manages, operates and repositions multifamily residential and commercial properties in the New York City area. It was founded in 2017. On March 14, Clipper Realty reported fourth-quarter 2023 operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.15 per share beat the $0.13 per share estimate and represented a 36.36% increase over FFO of $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue of $34.87 million was below the consensus estimate of $37.28 million, but slightly above revenue of $0.15 per share. $33.01 million in Q4 2022. On April 11, JMP Securities analyst Aaron Hecht downgraded Clipper Realty from Market Outperform to Market Perform. Hecht noted Clipper’s recent announcement as part of its fourth-quarter earnings report that it will lose its tenant at the 12-story 250 Livingston Street in Brooklyn at the end of its lease in August 2025. The tenant is the City of New York , and the annual rental price is 15.4 million dollars. While that gives Clipper plenty of time to re-lease the space, the analyst also noted that the tenant in this 294,144-square-foot commercial and residential building accounts for approximately 15% of Clipper’s net operating income. This creates what Hecht called “tenant uncertainty,” and Hecht believes Clipper Realty is now fairly valued.

From Forms to Reports: A Look at the UAD Overhaul - Appraisal Buzz,From Forms to Reports: A Look at the UAD Overhaul  Appraisal Buzz,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 10:02:50 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYXBwcmFpc2FsYnV6ei5jb20vZnJvbS1mb3Jtcy10by1yZXBvcnRzLWEtbG9vay1hdC10aGUtdWFkLW92ZXJoYXVsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Appraisal Buzz,"By now, most appraisers are aware that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) have embarked on a complete overhaul of the Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD). UAD originated in 2010 and since then we appraisers are accustomed to using codes like “C4,” “N;Res,” and “1200sf0sfin” in our mortgage appraisal reports to communicate the results of our analysis. These codes, or language, make sense to appraisers but confuse uninitiated readers of our reports. To bridge this barrier, appraisers include addenda in their reports that translate these codes into human interpretable language. It seems it would be better just using descriptive terms that our intended users could understand rather than needing to translate. How did we get here? It all starts with the standard appraisal forms used in the mortgage process. There are 12 principal forms used for a mortgage origination appraisal. These forms have been around since the early 1980s with a few revisions over the years. The original forms were designed before the digital age, to be completed on typewriters. These forms became fixed in the mortgage industry and have remained the standard for decades. Appraisal software companies have innovated the process of “filling out “these forms, but they are still constrained with the original typewriter design. The UAD “codes” that we use as appraisers are a result of restrictive nature of the “forms,” there is only so much space available on the forms. As a result, saying that a site location is residential in nature, and neutral in terms of surrounding influences becomes “N;Res;” to fit in the legacy form field. It has been four decades since the forms originated, and nobody uses typewriters anymore. All our forms are generated by software packages that transmit our reports via Extensible Markup Language (XML). But we are still stuck with the “form” functionality. The abbreviations we use in our forms are in fact, data points for the GSEs. Using the form structure, GSEs have been ingesting these eclectic abbreviations to develop a large database of residential valuation. If typewriters are no more, it is time for forms to be retired as well. Really, appraisers have always thought this way. We produce appraisal “reports” not appraisal “forms.” That is the perspective that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are taking with the new version of UAD. No longer will there be forms; there will only be a “report.” The new data set is all encompassing for every property type (residential) that were traditionally divided into 12 separate forms. The appraiser will be led through a process, defined by the scope of work. This scope of work is determined by the type of property and the characteristics of the property. Appraisers will be presented with the data elements needed to report the characteristics of the subject property, and analyze the market, comparables, and other necessary parts of the appraisal process. Only those data and report elements that are important for the scope of work will be presented to the appraiser. Data will be emphasized and made more discrete. The intention is to make the appraisal more objective and less reliant on subjective language and commentary. Data fields that were once abbreviated will be displayed in human understandable text. There may be more data points, but there will be less narration necessary by the appraiser. Appraiser can focus on analysis and less on commentary. Objective data and appropriate analysis of that data will reduce the overall liability for the Appraiser. The output will be a report, just as Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) requires. USPAP only addresses “forms “beyond the Standards required of appraisers. When USPAP speaks to forms, it is usually in the context of problems that arise from the use of forms. In terms of compliance, the new process-based approach may be advantageous for appraisers, reducing subjective language and reinforcing compliance with commentary as necessary. Again, Scope of Work, required by USPAP, is central to this new methodology. This all sounds great, but the road of innovation ahead will have some curves that need to be negotiated. There are many stakeholders in the mortgage process that these changes will impact and require significant resources for change. Lenders, Lender Technology Providers, Appraisal Management Companies (AMCs), Appraisal Software Providers, and Appraisers will need to devote time and resources to this evolution. In this list of stakeholders, I am most closely aligned with Appraisal Software Providers and Appraisers themselves. How will the new UAD standard affect these two stakeholders? First, let’s talk about Appraisal Software Providers. Appraisers have grown accustomed to the appraisal software they utilize and are reluctant to change. There are numerous reasons for this hesitancy. In their software, appraisers have historical files that they may want to refer to, they have extensive template language already developed, and frankly they’re just used to it. Because of these and other factors, appraisal software companies have had “sticky” subscribers. Most software companies have a static number of users; very few appraisers change software vendors, and there have been a very low volume of new appraisers entering the industry. With the introduction of the new UAD standard, appraisal software companies can expect a reshuffling of their subscriber base. The new output going to the GSEs will be highly commoditized into a singular report output. The legacy way of “filling out forms” and providing efficiencies for this matching the requirements of these forms is going away. Because of the dynamic nature of the new dataset, the way of producing a report will be completely disrupted. No longer will appraisers find the right field and check the right box. Reports in the new standard, will be dynamic, expanding and contracting, based on the scope of work for that appraisal assignment. Software vendors will be challenged to build this process flow in the most efficient manner possible while adhering to the strict data standards set out by a new UAD. What will set one software vendor apart from another is how efficient they make this process for the appraiser. The introduction of the new appraisal standard creates an environment where all software providers, both established and emerging, must develop solutions that adhere to these updated requirements. This necessitates innovation and adaptation, potentially narrowing the technological and market advantage that existing providers might have had. Newer companies can enter the market on more equal footing, offering fresh perspectives and innovative features. This could lead to increased competition, driving improvements in software functionality, user experience, and customer service. Ultimately, this scenario benefits appraisers, as they will have access to a wider range of improved software options tailored to the new standards. Astute appraisers will enjoy this champion-challenger environment the new data standard brings. Rather than sticking with their “old standby” software vendor, they will be able to evaluate what all software companies are bringing to the table. All the barriers to change will fall away. There will not be historical files in the brand-new systems, it is a fresh start. Templating language will be a thing of the past with more discrete data points and less narration. And certainly, nobody will be used to the “old way of doing things “in this new dynamic report environment. Appraisers who have been with one software company, most of their careers, might find themselves continuing their practice with a completely different vendor. Mortgage appraisers will benefit from these software changes for the reasons described above, but there are some other things to consider. Most appraisers have diversity in their business channels. In addition to mortgage work, they may do legal work, estates as well as many other channels of business. The UAD standard is for mortgage work only and specifically for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Appraisers will want to make sure that their software vendors can accommodate non-lending work in their new platforms. Hopefully, some of the software vendors will embrace the “scope of work” concept and design alternative appraisal reporting with a similar process. Appraisers will want to avoid having two software platforms, one for lending, and one for non-lending. Again, appraisal software companies will compete for meeting these needs as well. There are other concerns as well. Some appraisers will express apprehension about adapting to the new standards, particularly regarding the shift from narrative descriptions to more discrete data input. This change could potentially impact the appraisal of complex properties, where nuanced details are crucial. Additionally, the need for technology upgrades and training to adapt to these new systems poses a challenge, especially for smaller firms or individual appraisers. The comprehensive overhaul of the UAD by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac marks a significant milestone in the evolution of the real estate appraisal industry. By moving away from the limitations of traditional forms and embracing a more adaptable, descriptive reporting format, this initiative promises to enhance the accessibility and quality of appraisal reports. While the transition demands significant adaptation and investment from all involved, the potential benefits—increased transparency, efficiency, and understanding—make a compelling case for embracing this change. As the industry navigates through these transformations, the focus must remain steadfast on the ultimate objective: to refine and improve the appraisal reporting process for the benefit of all stakeholders involved.",https://appraisalbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/business-4561935_1280-e1712090752800.webp,2024-04-15,-0.314,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'UAD', 'latitude': 7.155179977416992, 'longitude': 29.679140090942383, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Res', 'latitude': 42.58277893066406, 'longitude': 19.8075008392334, 'location_type': 'POI'}]","Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are overhauling the Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) to improve accessibility and quality of appraisal reports.

Biden must rethink his title insurance waiver pilot program | Commentary - The Post and Courier,Biden must rethink his title insurance waiver pilot program | Commentary  The Post and Courier,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 19:15:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9jb21tZW50YXJ5L2JpZGVuLXRpdGxlLWluc3VyYW5jZS13YWl2ZXItcHJvZ3JhbS1taXNndWlkZWQvYXJ0aWNsZV9kMzNmODkxMi1mYjNkLTExZWUtOGNkMC03M2ZjZWYyYWI1MzYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Post and Courier,"Title insurance is a comprehensively regulated product in South Carolina, but under this pilot program, Fannie Mae would be responsible for resolving title problems that arise, something that is far beyond its mission and expertise. The risks from this shift could expose the housing market to more instability, similar to the loosening of lending standards that preceded the 2008 financial crisis . This proposal is deeply concerning — not only for the risks it presents to the housing market, but also for the implications for South Carolina’s small businesses and broader economy. According to a recent study, the title industry directly contributes 800 jobs and $99 million to South Carolina’s gross domestic product annually. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle share these concerns and have introduced the bipartisan Protecting America’s Property Rights Act, which would require title insurance on all loans purchased by the government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae. I urge Sen. Tim Scott to help pass this bill and call on the Biden administration to rethink its misguided title insurance waiver pilot program. To be clear: Making homeownership more attainable for all Americans is a worthy goal and should be a key priority for the administration. However, the best way to do that is by addressing the true barriers to homeownership — burdensome regulations and a lack of housing supply. While saving homeowners a few hundred bucks is a good talking point, the reality is that this pilot program is too risky for South Carolina and too risky for the country.

Three REITs With New Downgrades This Week - Yahoo Finance UK,Three REITs With New Downgrades This Week  Yahoo Finance UK,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 19:30:11 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdWsuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aHJlZS1yZWl0cy1kb3duZ3JhZGVzLXdlZWstMTkzMDExMDQwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance UK,"It's difficult for investors when analysts downgrade their stocks. But there are many reasons for an analyst downgrade. Sometimes a stock has risen to the point where the analyst feels it's no longer a good value relative to its price. At other times, competition, a perceived downturn in the general economy or the resignation of a longstanding company insider may lead the analyst to believe that a company is unlikely to perform well in the coming months. Whatever the reason, the usual outcome from a downgrade is a drop in the share price. But the drop may be temporary if the company develops new business, economic forecasts improve or new leadership proves its merit. Take a look at three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that have just received analyst downgrades and some of the concerns that warranted those decisions. TPG RE Finance Trust Inc. (NYSE:TRTX), a subsidiary of TPG Real Estate, is a mortgage REIT with a $4.2 billion portfolio of first mortgage loans with an average loan size of $71.6 million, in geographically diversified primary and select secondary markets across the U.S. On February 20, TPG RE Finance Trust reported its Q4 operating results. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.05 missed the estimate of $0.17. Revenue of $31.49 million was ahead of estimates of $24.73 million but below revenue from Q4 2022 of $35.99 million.

Unlock Real Wealth with Cityfunds’ Exclusive 8% Yield Fund. Despite the less-than-favorable earnings report, the earnings call was upbeat, and investors have continued to support the stock. Year-to-date, TPG RE Finance has had a total return of 16.33%. On April 12, Raymond James analyst Stephen Laws downgraded TPG RE Finance Trust from Strong Buy to Outperform while maintaining the price target at $8.50. This is still above the consensus average one-year price target of $7.90. Arbor Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:ABR) is a Long Island-based mortgage REIT (mREIT) that initiates bridge and mezzanine loans for commercial and residential properties. Many of its loans originate through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. Arbor Realty Trust generates profits by the spread between the loan financing cost and the interest earned from that loan. Many of Arbor Realty Trust's commercial loans are first mortgage liens that are short-term with higher interest rates. Arbor Realty's mid-February quarterly report was somewhat mixed. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.51 beat the consensus estimate of $0.44 per share, but it was 15% below EPS of $0.60 in Q4 2022. Revenue of $103.58 million also beat the consensus estimate of $97.65 million but decreased from $113.06 million in Q4 2022. On April 11, Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless downgraded Arbor Realty Trust from Outperform to Neutral and lowered the price target by 23.5% from $17 to $13. McCanless is concerned about higher interest rates for longer and the subsequent risks that Arbor Realty will incur for more delinquencies and non-performing loans. In addition, he sees the potential for lower loan volume. The analyst lowered the EPS estimate from $1.95 to $1.80 for 2024. Trending Want to Create a Passive Income Stream? These High-Yield Real Estate Notes Might Be Your Holy Grail Clipper Realty Inc. (NYSE:CLPR) is a small, New York-based, self-administered and self-managed REIT that owns, manages, operates and repositions multifamily residential and commercial properties in the New York City area. It was formed in 2017. On March 14, Clipper Realty reported its Q4 2023 operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.15 per share beat the estimate of $0.13 per share and represented a 36.36% increase from FFO of $0.11 per share in Q4 2022. Revenue of $34.87 million was below the consensus estimate of $37.28 million but slightly above revenue of $33.01 million in Q4 2022. On April 11, JMP Securities analyst Aaron Hecht downgraded Clipper Realty from Market Outperform to Market Perform. Hecht noted Clipper's recent announcement as part of its Q4 earnings report that it is losing its tenant at 12-story 250 Livingston Street in Brooklyn at the end of its lease in August 2025. The tenant is the City of New York, and the annual rent is $15.4 million. While that gives Clipper plenty of time to re-lease the space, the analyst also noted that the tenant in this 294,144 square-foot commercial and residential building accounts for approximately 15% of Clipper's net operating income. This creates what Hecht called ""tenant uncertainty,"" and Hecht believes that Clipper Realty is now fairly valued. Read Next: Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

On a quarterly basis, home prices rose a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent in Q1 2024, essentially the same as the growth in Q4 2023. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, home prices also increased by 1.7 percent in Q1 2024. ""Home prices continued to rise in the first quarter as the housing market remained seriously supply constrained,"" said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. ""The stabilization of mortgage rates in the 6.6 to 6.7 percent range in January helped to boost demand early in the first quarter, with existing home sales and mortgage applications both rising. Mortgage rates have trended upward again of late, but there is support for home prices in strong demographic demand from younger generations. We expect home sales to rise modestly this year as potential homebuyers appear to be acclimating to the higher-rate environment and, in some cases, may be less able to put off moving for life reasons."" The FNM-HPI is produced by aggregating county-level data to create both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted national indices that are representative of the whole country and designed to serve as indicators of general single-family home price trends. The FNM-HPI is publicly available at the national level as a quarterly series with a start date of Q1 1975 and extending to the most recent quarter, Q1 2024. Fannie Mae publishes the FNM-HPI approximately mid-month during the first month of each new quarter.

Harvard Study Again Stirs the Pot on Demotech Ratings of Florida Carriers - Claims Journal,Harvard Study Again Stirs the Pot on Demotech Ratings of Florida Carriers  Claims Journal,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 05:00:08 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNsYWltc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvMjAyNC8wNC8xNy8zMjMwNTEuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Claims Journal,"A study by researchers from Harvard and Columbia universities and at the Federal Reserve has reopened the debate about the financial fortitude and the financial rating system for dozens of Florida property insurance companies. The president of Demotech, the firm that rates the vast majority of Florida-domiciled carriers, said the study was incomplete, out of date, and was a continuation of a “hit job” that began in 2022, after Demotech reportedly warned that it planned to downgrade multiple Florida insurers. “One of the authors contacted us yet never responded when I offered to send whatever data she needed,” Petrelli said in an email. Petrelli did not respond to Insurance Journal when asked for clarification on some of his other points. Demotech’s “A” financial stability ratings have long been considered to be roughly equivalent to AM Best’s “B”-level ratings, which are strong enough for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the quasi-governmental entities (GSEs) that buy mortgages and require homes to be insured. But the study found that Demotech’s examinations and ratings are not as rigorous. “In particular, our estimates imply that close to 67% of Demotech insurers would not meet Freddie Mac’s eligibility requirement and 21% would not meet Fannie Mae’s requirement (at a 90% confidence level),” reads the paper. “Overall, these results strongly suggest inconsistencies in the GSE eligibility requirements across rating agencies. These inconsistencies could encourage ratings shopping, in particular among poor quality insurers who would not otherwise meet GSE eligibility.” The Florida Association of Insurance Agents’ president, who was one of several officials who sharply criticized Demotech in 2022, declined to comment about the study. But others in the insurance industry, including Florida regulators and some reinsurers, have questioned the soundness of Demotech’s rating system, warning that the firm has been inconsistent and has not followed its own criteria at times. Despite Demotech’s strong ratings of several Florida carriers, for example, Everest Re Group last year dropped some Florida insurers from its portfolio, noting that they did not meet underwriting standards. And in Arkansas last fall, United Home Insurance Co. was rated highly by Demotech – just days before it was placed in receivership. The uproar over Demotech’s ratings was so strong in 2022 that Florida officials and some insurers called for a new approach – switching to KBRA, formerly known as Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or establishing a state-run rating agency. In the ensuing months, though, the state plan received little attention from Florida lawmakers. And only a handful of Florida carriers moved over to KBRA. Petrelli and others have been quick to remind Floridians that much of the Florida-grown insurance market may not exist without Demotech’s ratings. After Hurricane Andrew slammed south Florida in 1992, a number of major national carriers pulled out of the state. As smaller, Florida-domiciled insurers cropped up to fill the gap, Demotech was often the only firm that would provide examinations and ratings, allowing the new carriers to write homes with Fannie- and Freddie-backed mortgages. The recent study, by Paranitha Sastry of Columbia, Ishita Sen of Harvard, and Ana-Maria Tenekedjieva of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, finds “that these new insurers would not meet GSE eligibility thresholds if subjected to traditional rating agencies’ methodologies.” That causes mortgage lenders to sell a large portion of their loans to Fannie and Freddie. And that, in turn, leads the GSEs to bear a large share of insurance counterparty risk, “driven by their mis-calibrated insurer eligibility requirements and lax insurance regulation.” The Demotech ratings have inconsistencies and are not as meaningful as one would hope, co-author Sen told the Tampa Bay Times last week. A statement from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae said the organizations review insurance company ratings, but do not try to influence the rating firms’ methodologies. The study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, raises its own questions and examines issues that some would say are old news in Florida. It also appears to refer to Demotech as an “emerging rating agency,” despite the fact that Demotech has been in business for more than 40 years. And the review is based partly on data resulting from Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida in 2017. The analysis noted that fragile insurance carriers may have caused some homeowners to default on the loans, perhaps after suffering heavy losses in hurricanes and being unable to recoup full replacement value from their insurance policies. The authors recommend that insurers should be rated by at least two rating firms. The report came amid a growing sense of relief in the Florida market, after four years of insolvencies and soaring premiums. One carrier, Florida Peninsula, recently announced a slight reduction in average rates in the state. And in the last 18 months, Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation has approved eight new carriers. Five of those were recently granted “A” stability ratings by Demotech. The startup known as Manatee Insurance Exchange, part of Safepoint Holdings Inc., was rated “A” by Demotech but received a “BBB” rating from KBRA. Ditto for Orange Insurance Exchange. Orion180 Insurance Co. was rated as “A” by Demotech and “BBB+” by KBRA. Two other startups have yet to be rated by any of the three rating firms. Mainsail, part of Spinnaker Insurance, is not rated by Demotech but won an “A-” or Excellent rating from AM Best. The Harvard/Columbia report can be seen here.

I am intentionally building a team and culture that supports that vision,” Malek said in a statement. “Steve is the real deal and cares deeply about the people, the culture, and the work. He is already bringing magic to our creative product and growing client roster.” Denekas comes to Crispin from Basic/Dept and Dept, where he was chief creative officer and global senior vice president. Denekas entered advertising at BBDO, where he learned how advertising and design worked best and how kindness brings out the best in creative teams. He was later at Wieden+Kennedy, Stagwell and Instrument. Denekas has worked with brands including Levi’s, Nike and Dodge. Malek joined Crispin in 2023. Prior to that, she was CEO of Houston-based MMI Agency. Under her leadership, the integrated creative agency saw rapid growth, along with client and staff retention. She is also a U.S. Army veteran. “The first brief from Maggie was to define the next 20 years of advertising.

Is the Housing Market on the Brink in 2024: Boom or Bust? - Digital Journal,Is the Housing Market on the Brink in 2024: Boom or Bust?  Digital Journal,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 08:21:33 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9wci9uZXdzL2dsb2JlLXByLXdpcmUvaG91c2luZy1tYXJrZXQtYnJpbmstMjAyNC1ib29tLTE0MDA4ODk1NjQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Digital Journal,"A common question on many people's minds is whether the U.S. housing market will crash again. To address this concern, it's essential to consider various expert analyses and economic indicators that provide insight into the future of real estate. The forecasts show that the housing market in 2024 is expected to continue grappling with high home prices and elevated mortgage rates, which have been a significant barrier to homeownership for many. Fannie Mae's senior vice president and chief economist, Doug Duncan, suggests that the market will likely face continued affordability constraints due to these high prices and interest rates. However, there is an anticipation of an increase in home sales transactions compared to the previous year, with a slower rise in home prices. Other market analysts predict a gradual thaw in the market with added challenges. Their forecasts suggest that as mortgage rates slowly fall, more buyers and sellers will enter the market, stabilizing housing prices. This stability is expected to be influenced by various factors, including demographic shifts and the impacts of climate change. Zillow's forecast aligns with the notion of a stable market, projecting a modest 0.2% decrease in home values nationally, indicating a trend towards market stability rather than a sharp decline. Some of the forecasts offer a slightly more optimistic view, predicting that prices will begin to rise again in most US cities, albeit at a slower pace that reflects historical norms. This suggests that while some markets may experience a rebound, others that have seen a more significant downturn might take longer to recover. There could be moderate appreciation in the housing market from 2024-2028, with regional disparities emerging. The Southern region, in particular, is expected to see substantial home price growth. Factors That Could Influence a Housing Market Crash in 2024 The stability of the housing market is a topic of significant interest and concern for homeowners, investors, and policymakers alike. As we look ahead to 2024, several factors could potentially lead to a downturn in the housing market. Understanding these factors is crucial for anyone involved in the real estate sector. One of the primary concerns is the possibility of rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve has been increasing rates to combat inflation, which could lead to higher mortgage rates and, consequently, a decrease in housing affordability. This could result in reduced demand for homes, as potential buyers may find it more challenging to secure financing. Inflation itself is another factor that could impact the housing market. Currently, at a 40-year high, inflation erodes consumers' purchasing power, making it more difficult for them to afford homes at current prices. If wages do not keep pace with inflation, this could further strain the market A potential recession is also a concern that economists are warning about. If the US economy were to enter a recession in 2024, it could lead to job losses and a decrease in consumer confidence, which would likely reduce the demand for housing. Another factor to consider is the level of household debt. With mortgages, credit cards, and student loans leading the way, household debt has recently surpassed $17 trillion. High levels of debt can limit consumers' ability to take on additional mortgage debt, potentially slowing down the housing market. Supply disruptions, along with rising labor and raw construction materials costs, have been identified as contributing factors to sustained real house price gains. These issues could exacerbate the affordability crisis and lead to a market correction. The housing market's connection to economic fundamentals is also a point of analysis. When the market becomes unhinged from these fundamentals, such as shifts in disposable income and the cost of credit, it can lead to speculative bubbles. If many buyers operate under a 'fear of missing out' and drive up prices, this can heighten expectations of strong house-price gains and potentially lead to a bubble burst. Lastly, regional disparities could play a role. While some areas may see substantial home price growth, others that have experienced significant downturns might take longer to recover. This uneven growth can create pockets of instability within the broader market. In summary, while the term ""crash"" may not accurately describe the state of the US housing market in 2024, it is clear that the market is undergoing a period of adjustment. The consensus among experts points towards a market that is stabilizing and adapting to new economic conditions, rather than collapsing. As always, potential homebuyers and sellers should stay informed and consider their circumstances when navigating the housing market.

On a quarterly basis, home prices rose a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent in Q1 2024, essentially the same as the growth in Q4 2023. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, home prices also increased by 1.7 percent in Q1 2024. ""Home prices continued to rise in the first quarter as the housing market remained seriously supply constrained,"" said Doug Duncan , Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. ""The stabilization of mortgage rates in the 6.6 to 6.7 percent range in January helped to boost demand early in the first quarter, with existing home sales and mortgage applications both rising. Mortgage rates have trended upward again of late, but there is support for home prices in strong demographic demand from younger generations. We expect home sales to rise modestly this year as potential homebuyers appear to be acclimating to the higher-rate environment and, in some cases, may be less able to put off moving for life reasons."" The FNM-HPI is produced by aggregating county-level data to create both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted national indices that are representative of the whole country and designed to serve as indicators of general single-family home price trends. The FNM-HPI is publicly available at the national level as a quarterly series with a start date of Q1 1975 and extending to the most recent quarter, Q1 2024. Fannie Mae publishes the FNM-HPI approximately mid-month during the first month of each new quarter.

Fannie Mae - Sacramento Appraisal Blog,Fannie Mae  Sacramento Appraisal Blog,"Tue, 03 Oct 2017 06:23:01 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2FjcmFtZW50b2FwcHJhaXNhbGJsb2cuY29tL3RhZy9mYW5uaWUtbWFlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Sacramento Appraisal Blog,"Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but I find some people sounding off about housing seem disconnected from the actual market. I want to talk about that below and share some trends. Skim by topic or digest slowly. UPCOMING SPEAKING GIGS: 4/25/24 HomeSmart iCare Realty (details TBA) 4/26/24 Prime Real Estate (private) 5/9/24 Empire Home Loans (details TBA) 5/15/24 Investor Meetup (details TBA) 6/6/24 Golden 1 Credit Union (details TBA) 6/11/24 Elk Grove Regional MLS Meeting 8:30am 6/13/24 Sacramento Realtist Association (details TBA) CONSUMERS ARE JUGGLING This is a meme I made a few days back, and unfortunately it perfectly describes the moment. And this is why mortgage rate increases lately aren’t easy to digest since buyers are already juggling so much. STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET Look, you don’t have to be a practicing real estate professional to have a housing take or know the market. I’ll be honest. It bugs me when people are told to stay in their lane because they don’t work in a field. As if I can’t have an opinion about Taylor Swift since I’m not a musician. Or I can’t talk about basketball because I don’t play for the Kings (put me in coach). Or an athlete can’t talk about politics because she isn’t a politician (oh, that one got real). Of course, there is such a thing as expertise, so I’m not planning to lecture today about paleontology or the history of communism. Haha. When it comes to housing, there are some people spewing opinions that are pretty disconnected from the actual market since the narrative just doesn’t line up with what it’s like in the trenches. I find this to be especially prominent with a housing crash narrative that paints everything with darkness, but doesn’t tend to concede it’s been competitive.This can happen on the rosy side too when people aren’t willing to look at red flags in the marketplace because they’re distracted by multiple offers. Ultimately, some people only want to promote a narrative, and I find that to be very limiting because the market isn’t just one thing. We ARE really struggling with affordability, AND the market has been intense considering the lack of affordability. In short, everyone gets to have an opinion, but not every opinion has credibility. On that note, how do you gauge credibility for a housing analyst? And does credibility even matter to people today? Long story short. 54% of pendings over the past week had multiple offers in the Sacramento region in the midst of rate hikes, so it’s not totally frozen like some people are saying. Of course, could the housing temperature change very quickly ahead if rates continue to rise? You betcha. Do you know what would be surprising? If the temperature didn’t change with rates around 7.5%. GETTING CLARIFICATION ON CONCESSIONS In light of the NAR lawsuit, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac clarified yesterday that if a seller pays for the buyer’s agent commission, it will NOT count within the allowable amount for concessions (as long as it remains customary for sellers to cover the buyer’s side of the commission in the marketplace). This isn’t new policy, but it’s nice to have some clarity since we’ve been wondering. I wrote about concessions a few weeks ago, and I updated the post with links to the press releases. I also posted on my socials yesterday, and the posts have quite a bit of attention. SELLER GREED ISN’T SEXY I talked to a real estate agent this week who has an upset seller that the property didn’t go even higher above the asking price. Bro, it’s not 2021 out there, so don’t expect that dynamic. Technically, if you’re a seller wanting a bidding war, just price lower. Don’t expect buyers to go substantially above value though in a market where affordability is a struggle. LOOKING FOR HOUSING TEMPERATURE CHANGE One of the things I’m watching closely right is what sellers are giving buyers in terms of concessions. What are you noticing? About 38% of sales last month had concessions in Sacramento County, and it’s normal to see this number decline during a traditional spring. Do we start to see sellers have to offer more to buyers ahead if rates persist higher? My advice to sellers is to listen closely to what buyers need, and be open to lowering the price and/or offering concessions if the market requires. Please don’t take rate increases lightly. Go to a mortgage calculator to see how much it costs to buy your house right now. MORE ADVICE FOR BUYERS PLEASE Agent friends, I’d love to see more content that focuses on the buyer side. How do you get an offer accepted? How can a buyer get concessions in a market like today? What types of situations do you recommend offering below the list price? When do you need to go above? Often real estate professionals focus heavily on sellers, but buyers need attention and help right now. EXPECT LOWER DEMAND In coming weeks, we’re going to understand more about how higher rates are affecting buyers and sellers. I’d be shocked if the number of pendings didn’t dip if rates keep this high, but only time will tell. No matter what, we’ll see the trend first in the listings and pendings. If we only look to sales, it’ll be a month or two to see the trend since it takes time for properties to get into contract and close. Remember, the stories of today turn into the stats of tomorrow. So far, pendings and new listings for April as a whole have been pretty normal seasonally (still way lower than usual though). But let’s watch very closely ahead from this week onward. SOME ENCOURAGEMENT A few thoughts I shared on my social channels yesterday. Just some things on my mind. I wanted to offer some encouragement in the midst of what feels like uncertainty salad in the economy and real estate market. WATCH GROWTH IN LISTINGS I had the hardest time explaining this until I used blocks. In the fall of 2023, I made a reel with blocks to explain how listings can grow. At the time, we were seeing more active listings, but it wasn’t really due to sellers rushing the market. Well, today we’re legit having more new listings, but it’s still buyer behavior that can make the biggest difference. View this post on Instagram Thanks for being here. Questions: What are you seeing in the market right now? What are buyers and sellers saying? What do you think of Fannie Mae’s clarification on commissions? I’d love to hear your take.

Many lenders will issue government-backed FHA and VA loans to borrowers with credit scores starting at 580. Some lenders even offer FHA loans with a credit score as low as 500, though this is far less common. With a credit score above 600, your options open up even more. Conventional mortgages require only a 620 score to qualify. And with a credit score of 680 or higher, you could apply for just about any home loan. Verify your home loan eligibility. Start here In this article (Skip to...) Lowest score to buyWhat is bad credit?Home loans for bad creditBad credit mortgage lendersGetting a bad credit home loanFAQ Can I buy a house with bad credit? Yes, you can buy a house with bad credit. While getting approved for a home loan with bad credit is challenging, it’s not impossible. Check your home loan options. Start here Across the industry, the lowest possible credit score to get a mortgage loan is 500. However, it’s important to note that mortgage lenders willing to accommodate such low scores are few and far between. Additionally, these lenders usually charge higher interest rates to offset the risk associated with lending to borrowers with poor credit histories. What do mortgage lenders consider a bad credit score? The definition of a bad credit score varies between mortgage lenders. But, as a rule of thumb, the FICO scoring model considers scores below 580 to be “poor” or “bad.” If you’re looking for a mortgage with a credit score below 620, it may be considered a “low credit mortgage.” Verify your home loan eligibility. Start here FICO credit score ranges: Below 580: Bad credit580 to 669: Fair credit670 to 739: Good credit740 or above: Excellent credit Still, some home buyers can qualify for a home loan with a FICO score as low as 500, depending on the loan program. Home loans for bad credit Home buyers seeking bad credit home loans have multiple programs to choose from. Yet, the FHA loan stands out as the most common mortgage option for those with poor credit histories. When comparing home loans for bad credit, evaluate the loan terms, interest rates, and monthly payments to determine which suits your personal finances best. Verify your home loan eligibility. Start here Although each loan program and lender has its own unique credit score requirements and minimum down payments, here’s what you can generally expect to see: FHA loan: 500 credit score An FHA mortgage is a government-backed loan guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. This is why they’re a good option for borrowers with bad credit. You can qualify for an FHA loan with a low credit score of 500 and a 10% down payment, or 3.5% down if your FICO is 580 or above. FHA loans accept applicants with credit scores as low as 500.Applicants with scores between 500 and 579 need a 10% down payment.Borrowers with low or bad credit may pay higher mortgage interest rates, but FHA loan rate increases are typically lower than conventional loans.An upfront and annual mortgage insurance premium (MIP) is required, which adds to the loan’s overall cost. Another appealing quality is that, unlike conventional loans, FHA-backed mortgages don’t carry risk-based pricing. This is also known as “loan-level pricing adjustments” (LLPAs). Risk-based pricing is a fee added to loan applications with lower credit scores or other less-than-ideal traits. Check your FHA loan eligibility. Start here FHA loans are a strong option if you’re seeking home loans with bad credit. This type of mortgage offers lenient qualifying credit requirements and no risk-based pricing adjustments. Non-qualified mortgage (Non-QM): 500 credit score Non-QM loans offer a more flexible lending criteria for those who do not meet the strict qualifications of conventional mortgages, with some available to borrowers with credit scores as low as 500. Tailored for applicants unable to qualify for mainstream home loans.Usually charge higher interest rates compared to other types of loans. For individuals with bad credit, non-QM loans provide an alternative path to homeownership, albeit with potentially higher costs. Check your bad credit home loan options. Start here If you’re interested in a non-QM loan, check out the specialty mortgage programs some banks and credit unions offer that are neither conventional loans nor government-backed. Or, work with a mortgage broker who can recommend products from various lenders that might fit your needs. VA loan: 580 credit score The Department of Veterans Affairs offers VA loans to veterans, active-duty service members, and some military-affiliated borrowers. VA loans do not require a down payment or ongoing mortgage insurance payments. VA loans do not have a minimum credit score, but lenders typically prefer a minimum of 580 to 620.Borrowers with lower credit scores get rates comparable to those with higher credit scores.VA loans are renowned for offering the lowest interest rates available.A one-time funding fee is included, which most borrowers roll into their closing costs. Verify your VA loan eligibility. Start here VA loans are among the best options for financing a home for those who qualify, regardless of credit history. Conventional loan: 620 credit score Conventional loans are arguably the most common type of mortgage. Borrowers with low credit scores may wish to consider alternative options because a conventional loan would most likely have higher interest rates and fees. A minimum credit score of 620 is generally required.Loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs) are based on credit score and loan-to-value ratio (LTV).Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is required for down payments of less than 20% of the home purchase price. As your LTV rises and your credit score falls, your fee goes up. For instance, a borrower with a 20% down payment and a 700 credit score will pay 1.25% of the loan amount in LLPAs. But an applicant with a 640 score and 10% down will be charged a fee of 2.75%. Verify your conventional loan eligibility. Start here Still, despite the higher costs associated with lower credit scores, conventional loans remain a viable option for many, with FHA loans often presenting a more cost-effective route for bad-credit borrowers. Fannie Mae HomeReady: 620 credit score The HomeReady program by Fannie Mae offers an avenue for low- to moderate-income borrowers to secure financing with just a 3% down payment. A minimum credit score of 620.Available to both first-time and repeat home buyers.Offers reduced rates for private mortgage insurance compared to standard conventional loans. Verify your HomeReady eligibility. Start here HomeReady is an excellent program for those looking to finance homes in low-income communities. Freddie Mac Home Possible: 660 credit score Freddie Mac’s first-time home buyer program, Home Possible, can help buyers get into homes with a 3% down payment. Minimum credit score of 660Must be a first-time home buyerDown payment assistance programs are available for those unable to save the required down payment. Verify your Home Possible eligibility. Start here This loan program is particularly well suited for first-time home buyers with moderate credit. USDA loan: 640 credit score USDA loans are popular with home buyers in qualifying rural areas because they offer zero-down payment options and competitive mortgage rates. Applicants need a minimum 640 credit score to qualify.The property must be situated in a designated rural area.Household income cannot exceed 115% of the area median income (AMI).Whether you’re purchasing a home or refinancing your current mortgage with a USDA loan, you’ll pay a 1% upfront guarantee fee and a 0.35% annual fee. Verify your USDA loan eligibility. Start here A USDA mortgage is a government-backed loan guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This is why USDA loans are a great option for people looking to buy real estate in a rural area because they have flexible credit requirements and require no down payment. Bad credit mortgage lenders A less-than-perfect FICO score doesn’t mean you’re confined to dealing with subpar mortgage lenders. Surprisingly, some top-tier lenders specialize in assisting borrowers whose credit scores hover around or even dip below 600. While it’s true that qualification may not be possible for everyone and your interest rate might be above what a “prime” mortgage borrower would receive, you have just as much right to seek out the best mortgage rates, fees, and customer service. Don’t let your credit score deter you from exploring all available options. For comprehensive advice on finding the right lender for your situation, check out our guide to the best bad credit mortgage lenders. This resource lists the top lenders specifically catering to bad credit home loans, helping you make an informed decision that aligns with your needs. How to get a home loan for bad credit Improving your chances of getting a bad credit home loan may seem daunting, but there are strategies to boost your loan approval odds. As you begin the loan application process, mortgage underwriters will review your entire financial history. If your credit is low but the rest of your financial picture looks good, you’re more likely to get approved. Check your home loan options. Start here By following these proven steps, you can significantly improve your appeal to lenders and streamline your home buying process. Check your free credit report for accuracy The three major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) make mistakes sometimes. Your creditors can report inaccurate information to the credit bureaus, too. Monitor your credit history to notice errors before they lower your score. The government has set up a website where you can check your credit accounts free: annualcreditreport.com Dispute inaccurate information If you do find inaccurate information in your credit history, be sure to file a dispute, especially if the errors include huge blemishes like foreclosures, repossessions, or collections accounts. Collections accounts can linger on your credit reports for years. They can negatively impact your financial standing even after they’re paid, as paying off a collection upgrades its status to “Paid” but doesn’t remove it from your report. Negotiating for its complete removal, known as “Pay for Delete,” by contacting the collection agency and offering payment in exchange for deletion from your credit report is a game-changer. Always ensure this agreement is in writing before making any payments, effectively erasing the financial mishap and potentially boosting your credit score. Get mortgage loan preapproval Securing mortgage preapproval is a pivotal step for buyers with bad credit. It not only clarifies your budget but also boosts your appeal to sellers. The preapproval process can also pinpoint where to improve your credit so be honest about your finances when seeking preapproval; lenders may suggest programs for credit issues. Lower your DTI and credit utilization ratios Lenders evaluate your debt-to-income ratio, or DTI, to determine if you can afford a new monthly mortgage payment. Reducing existing debts before submitting a mortgage application can make qualifying for a home loan easier. Similarly, paying down credit card debt and personal loan balances also lowers your credit utilization ratio. Credit utilization measures your debt balance against your credit limit. For instance, a $7,000 balance on a $10,000 credit limit results in a 70% ratio, which is considered high. Aiming for a utilization ratio of 30% or lower can significantly boost your credit score. Improve your payment history Missed and late payments will lower your FICO score. Be sure to make on-time payments on all your loans and credit cards. It’s a good idea to set your accounts on autopay. Consider a co-signer If you’re unable to qualify for a mortgage due to a low credit score, you might want to consider bringing a co-signer into the equation. A co-signer essentially vouches for you, making lenders more comfortable with extending credit your way. In essence, you’re leveraging another person’s higher credit score and financial stability to boost your chances of securing that loan. That said, it’s crucial to understand the responsibilities and implications for both parties involved. The co-signer’s credit score will be affected, for better or worse, by the loan’s performance. Lenders might also average your credit scores, depending on their specific policies, which can make the loan more attainable. Nevertheless, your interest rates will often be based on the lower of the two scores, meaning you may pay a bit more over the life of the loan. Avoid unnecessary hard pulls First things first: not all credit checks are detrimental to your credit score. Soft inquiries, such as those conducted for background checks, don’t affect your score. However, hard inquiries, like the ones made when you apply for a new credit card or a loan, can lower your score a bit. Each hard pull can reduce your credit score by a few points. So always check whether the creditor will be performing a hard or soft pull on your credit report. Leverage home equity For homeowners who are unable to cash-out refinance due to bad credit, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a solution. A HELOC allows access to funds based on the equity built in the home. By tapping into home equity through a HELOC, individuals bypass the strict credit requirements of conventional cash-out refinancing. This approach can unlock cash for renovations, debt consolidation, or other financial needs, even when a poor credit score would typically close doors to such opportunities.

He resided with his parents in the St. Bernard Housing Project for many years prior to moving with his parents to the Lower Ninth Ward. He attended Booker T. Washington High School and Southern University in New Orleans. He was a lifelong resident of New Orleans until he joined the United States Air Force. Upon his discharge he then moved to Birmingham, Alabama where he worked at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. In New Orleans, he answered the Lord's call and embarked on becoming a Pastor in the Methodist Church, specifically St. Roch Methodist Church in New Orleans, Louisiana. He began his African Methodist Episcopal Pastoral services in 2012 at York Chapel A. M. E. Church. He was appointed to St. Peter-St. Paul A. M. E. Church on October 24, 2015.

The policy changes, which go into effect Thursday, impact capital underwriting and due diligence around Know Your Customer policies and appraisals. The changes mark the second significant policy shift since Freddie Mac launched an investigation into Meridian Capital Group in November. “Freddie Mac remains focused on risk management and works to enhance our processes to better detect and deter fraud and misrepresentation,” Ian Ouwerkerk, Freddie Mac's senior vice president of multifamily underwriting and credit, said in a statement. “We take these issues seriously, and these enhancements are just the latest step in our effort to manage risk and improve our execution.” The policy shifts are reflected in the government-sponsored entity’s new Multifamily Seller/Servicer Guide, to be released Thursday. They boost the number of unit inspections and the lease audit sample size for property inspections, along with requiring additional documentation to confirm the accuracy of reported tenant rent payments. The updated Know Your Customer requirements include additional due diligence for first-time borrowers or those with limited multifamily experience. The rules also call for enhanced liquidity verification for borrowers. Freddie Mac is also strengthening its appraisal review process and appraiser independence requirements to safeguard the “objectivity and impartiality of appraisers.” The lender will also update policies that limit business “with certain title companies when applicable” for its multifamily lending arm. The policy changes follow a November move from Freddie Mac to require that loan documentation come directly from borrowers and not from brokers involved in the transaction. Fannie Mae, the other federally backed purchaser of multifamily mortgages, made a similar move around the same time when it introduced a pre-review requirement for all agency-backed loans involving brokers. Freddie Mac is concerned that the position of the market in the real estate cycle could drive an increase in fraud attempts. The policy changes followed a November report that Freddie Mac was investigating Meridian Capital for allegedly fabricating numbers in applications to help clients get larger loans. The ongoing investigation caused Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to halt any transactions with Meridian. Brokers at the New York-based firm, one of the country’s largest brokers of commercial mortgages, have been blacklisted by Freddie Mac even if they left Meridian for other firms, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Meridian brokers have reportedly faced increased scrutiny amid the near-collapse of New York Community Bank, which used Meridian to find borrowers. No specific title companies are referenced in the new Freddie Mac rules, but Fannie Mae notified lenders in February that it would no longer accept loans from Riverside Abstract and Madison Title. The firms are linked to two deals with New York investor Boruch Drillman, who pleaded guilty in December to a years-long conspiracy to secure $165M in loans using fictitious documents. Neither firm was charged in the case. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are government-sponsored entities tasked with providing liquidity to the mortgage market. They have been overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since the 2008 financial crisis. Freddie Mac purchased more than $49B in multifamily loans in 2023, supporting 423,177 affordable rental units, while Fannie Mae closed the year with more than $52B in multifamily financing. The entities typically package the loans they acquire into securities and sell them to investors in the private market. Both agencies are capped at up to $70B each in multifamily loan purchases for 2024, not including mortgages they acquire for workforce housing.",https://imageserver-bisnow1.netdna-ssl.com/zma-QNGzfSrW3biW8VJ6F9wacmI=/710x484/publisher/662008a065f71-freddie-mac-headquarters-8200-branch-drive-mclean-virginia-washington-dc.jpeg,2024-04-17,-0.115,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meridian Capital Group', 'latitude': 40.703460693359375, 'longitude': -74.013427734375, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meridian', 'latitude': 43.165618896484375, 'longitude': -76.5368881225586, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Street', 'latitude': 51.12472152709961, 'longitude': -2.740000009536743, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'York', 'latitude': 44.0513916015625, 'longitude': -79.48027801513672, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Riverside', 'latitude': 33.95335006713867, 'longitude': -117.39615631103516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Madison', 'latitude': 40.75981903076172, 'longitude': -74.41709899902344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not-related content.

Wiley Nickel (D-NC)—who wrote a letter to President Biden expressing concerns regarding the administration's plan approved by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to waive title insurance on loans purchased by Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. ""While well-intentioned, this pilot program will not address the true issue of housing affordability in our communities and puts homebuyers at risk,"" the members wrote. ""Title insurance professionals halt fraudulent real estate transactions such as impersonation scams, elder financial exploitation, and attempts to defraud spouses, partners, or other property heirs. Under the new program, consumers and lenders will be forced into a completely experimental claims resolution process with the GSEs, ultimately risking being forced into property sale or foreclosure. We ask that you reconsider moving forward. While we understand the enormity of the housing affordability crisis, shifting risk from the well-regulated title insurance industry to the GSEs and pushing small businesses out of the real estate ecosystem is not the right path forward to address that crisis."" ""On behalf of title companies in every county nationwide, who work tirelessly every day to protect the American dream of homeownership, we commend the leadership of Rep. Nickel and his Democratic colleagues in raising serious concerns about the administration's title waiver pilot program,"" said ALTA CEO Diane Tomb. ""While well intentioned, this program is flawed—removing the expertise and protections provided by title professionals and doing little to promote homeownership affordability for those who need it the most while heightening risk at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It is encouraging to have such thoughtful Members of Congress who understand the importance of sound housing policy."" Other signers of the letter were Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-MA), Rep. Lou Correa (D-CA), Rep. Jim Costa (D-CA), Rep. Joe Courtney (D-CT), Rep. Angie Craig (D-MN), Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), Rep.

Jennifer Wexton (D-VA) and Rep. Nikema Williams (D-GA). To read the full letter, click here. The title waiver program has faced bipartisan backlash from Members of Congress since being revived ahead of the State of the Union. Last month, three Republican members from the House Financial Services Committee—Warren Davidson (R-OH), Bill Huizenga (R-MI) and Andrew Garbarino (R-NY)—wrote a letter to the FHFA questioning whether the program conflicts with the agency's Prior Approval for Enterprise Products rule.

Fannie Mae's New Mortgage-Scoring System Aims to Lift MBS Demand - Yahoo Finance,Fannie Mae's New Mortgage-Scoring System Aims to Lift MBS Demand  Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 16:12:32 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mYW5uaWUtbWFlLW1vcnRnYWdlLXNjb3Jpbmctc3lzdGVtLTE2MTIzMjM0NS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance,"(Bloomberg) -- Fannie Mae is selling agency mortgage backed securities designed to appeal to socially minded investors, as the mortgage giant looks to draw more buyers into the market to help fill a void left by the Federal Reserve stopping purchases. Most Read from Bloomberg Since March, the government-sponsored enterprise has been selling agency MBS that are scored according to a set of revamped criteria that gives extra weight to mortgages with certain characteristics, such as whether they’re used for affordable rental housing or are to borrowers in rural areas with high poverty levels. The goal is to give investors who buy MBS more visibility into the underlying mortgages. Greater availability of data can make it more attractive to buy MBS with loans to underserved borrowers, translating into lower interest rates to borrowers with those types of mortgages. “It costs money to originate one of these mortgages,” Fannie Mae Chief Executive Officer Priscilla Almodovar said in an interview, referring to the costs that lenders incur when they make mortgages to underserved borrowers. “This is the way for us to incentivize them.” The new program is an updated version of the “social” index first rolled out in late 2022. Change is needed, Almodovar said, because the agency MBS market is transitioning to a new era in which two of its biggest investor groups no longer hold the dominant roles in the market that they used to, or are missing in action altogether. Domestic banks have lessened participation and the Federal Reserve is letting MBS roll off its balance sheet. It’s hard to overstate how important those two players have been in the market the past 15 years, according to Devang Doshi, a senior vice president at Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae and sister groups Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae have issued around $4 trillion of MBS over that period — which Doshi said is nearly all accounted for by the Federal Reserve and domestic banks’ added holdings. “Mortgage rates are going to be dictated by asset managers and no longer the Fed’s portfolio,” he said, adding this is why Fannie Mae must take steps to ensure MBS are attractive to investors. Fannie Mae first auctioned mortgage bonds with Mission scores in March, with a second sale held earlier this month. Freddie Mac will begin applying the new Mission Index criteria to its own bonds starting in June. “It’s still too early to tell how effective the mission index will be in creating demand for underserved borrowers,” said Erica Adelberg, MBS strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence. “But there currently aren’t a lot of [MBS] pools that score high on the Mission rankings, so it seems like there’s room for upside.” Pools with high scores may not only appeal to investors looking to satisfy social mandates, Adelberg added, but also funds looking for more-favorable prepayment behavior. --With assistance from Stefani Reynolds.

Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are among those clarifying policies regarding how commissions could impact loans, Inman reported. While the seller side of a transaction is coming into focus, however, the new norms awaiting the buyer side remain elusive. Fannie and Freddie told lenders that sellers may continue to pay buyer agent commissions, as is standard, and that those payments won’t count against limits for “interested party contributions.” Fannie and Freddie restrict IPCs, or concessions that may benefit interested parties if homes sell for especially high prices, to between 2 and 9 percent of the property’s value. That protects lenders vulnerable to buyers paying more than a home’s actual worth, as buyers with home equity are less likely to be foreclosed upon. The Department of Housing and Urban Development appears to be in lockstep with Fannie and Freddie regarding FHA loans. HUD said sellers can pay buyer’s agent fees without that counting as a seller concession. While those decisions should help clarify existing policies, they don’t shed light on what happens if a buyer prefers to pay for their agent on their own and if that can be incorporated into a mortgage. The pending $418 million settlement by the National Association of Realtors of various legal actions would ultimately see commissions paid to buyer’s agents being removed from asking prices. Consumer Federation of America senior fellow Stephen Brobeck suggested in a report buyers would be more inclined to hire an agent if they were allowed to finance agent compensation through mortgages no larger than their current loans. One proposal on the table would see Fannie, Freddie and the FHA gain the power to guarantee loans slightly exceeding the appraised value of a home, so long as excess funds are used to pay non-recurring closing costs such as commissions. — Holden Walter-Warner",https://static.therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NATL-Mortgage-industry-contend-with-new-commission-rules-FEATUREIMG_v2.jpg,2024-04-18,-0.084,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Inman', 'latitude': 38.230281829833984, 'longitude': -97.77278137207031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HUD', 'latitude': 53.64799880981445, 'longitude': -1.784999966621399, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Federation', 'latitude': -28.83146095275879, 'longitude': 121.7739028930664, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Warner', 'latitude': 35.494258880615234, 'longitude': -95.3055191040039, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have clarified that sellers can continue to pay buyer agent commissions, and those payments won't count against limits for ""interested party contributions.""

First-time buyer loans typically have more flexible requirements, such as a lower down payment and credit score. Many help buyers with closing costs and the down payment through grants and low-interest loans. Here is our comprehensive guide to both first-time homebuyer loans and programs. What is a first-time homebuyer program? First-time homebuyer programs help make homeownership more affordable for people who haven’t ever owned a home (or haven’t owned a home in some time). These programs come in a variety of flavors, but usually include a mortgage with a better interest rate, lower down payment requirement and other upsides like down payment and closing costs assistance. Types of first-time homebuyer programs Low-down payment conventional loans: Conventional loan programs that require just 3 percent down Down payment assistance (DPA) programs: Loans, grants and matching programs to help you with your down payment Federal first-time homebuyer programs: Loans and programs backed or offered by the federal government State, non-profit and employer-sponsored programs: Homebuying assistance at the local level Along with these, first-time homebuyers who are students or in a certain profession might qualify for a special type of loan, as well. Below, we’ll break down what each of these programs entails: Low-down payment conventional loans Conventional loans are the most popular type of mortgage, and only require 3 percent down. This makes them an attractive option for first-time homebuyers who might not have considerable savings to draw from. These low-down payment loans include the: Conventional 97 mortgage: This conventional loan, backed by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, requires just 3 percent down and a minimum credit score of 620. It also requires you to pay for private mortgage insurance (PMI), a type of policy that protects your mortgage lender should you stop paying back your loan. You’ll pay these premiums until you pay down your balance to 80 percent of the value of your home. HomeReady mortgage: Similar to the Conventional 97 program, Fannie Mae’s HomeReady mortgage program also requires just 3 percent down (with PMI, although it might be less expensive). Home Possible mortgage: Freddie Mac’s Home Possible mortgage program is the counterpart to the HomeReady mortgage, with a 3 percent minimum down payment requirement. HomeOne mortgage: This Freddie Mac-backed mortgage also allows for just 3 percent down with PMI, but is available only to first-time homebuyers. You won’t get your low-down payment conventional loan directly from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Instead, you’ll work with a mortgage lender of your choosing, which might be a bank, online lender or credit union, for example. Through state housing finance agencies (HFAs), Fannie and Freddie also back another set of 3 percent down payment programs, called HFA Preferred and HFA Advantage, respectively. Down payment assistance (DPA) options There are many types of down payment assistance, including: Down payment assistance loans Many first-time homebuyer programs offer a lower-cost first mortgage to help you buy the home, then a second mortgage to help you cover your down payment and closing costs. These second mortgages are commonly structured as either: Low-interest loans: A low-interest second mortgage you’ll repay over the course of a few years Deferred-payment loans: A no-interest second mortgage you’ll repay when you sell the home, refinance or pay off your first mortgage Forgivable loans: A second mortgage you won’t have to pay back so long as you stay in the home for a certain amount of time (the exact period depends on the program) and stay up-to-date with your mortgage payments Down payment savings match Down payment savings match programs provide matched funds up to a certain amount. The money can only be used for your down payment and closing costs. One type of matched savings program is an Individual Development Account (IDA). If you qualify, you’ll work with an assigned counselor to deposit funds into an IDA over a set period of time. If you follow the savings plan, you’ll receive the match when you close on the home. Down payment grants A down payment or first-time homebuyer grant is essentially free money to help you cover your down payment or closing costs. The grants are usually awarded to low- or moderate-income borrowers, typically defined as those earning no more than 80 percent of the median income in their area. They might have other requirements, too, like a minimum credit score and maximum home purchase price. Federal first-time homebuyer programs Government-backed mortgage loans The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Agriculture (USDA) back mortgage programs that are often an option for first-time homebuyers. These loans aren’t created or funded by these agencies, however; they’re offered through approved mortgage lenders throughout the U.S. Some lenders even specialize in certain types. Here’s an overview: FHA loan: Insured by the Federal Housing Administration, FHA loans allow you to buy a home with a minimum credit score of 580 and as little as 3.5 percent down, or a credit score as low as 500 with at least 10 percent down. If you put down less than 20 percent, you’ll pay FHA mortgage insurance premiums (MIP), similar to the insurance you’d pay for a low-down payment conventional loan. The difference, though: You can’t stop paying FHA MIP unless you refinance out of an FHA loan entirely. VA loan: The VA guarantees home loans for eligible U.S. military members (active duty, veterans and surviving spouses). These don’t require a down payment, though there is a funding fee. USDA loan: USDA loans don’t require a down payment, but you’ll need to purchase in a designated rural area and all under area-specific income limits to qualify. Good Neighbor Next Door The Good Neighbor Next Door program, overseen by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is geared toward law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and pre-kindergarten through 12th grade teachers. If you work in one of these professions, you could buy a home in a “revitalization area” for 50 percent off, provided you live in the home for at least three years. You can search for properties available in your state on the program’s website. HomePath Ready Buyer Program Fannie Mae’s HomePath ReadyBuyer program is geared toward first-time buyers interested in a foreclosed home. After taking a required online homebuyer education course, you can receive up to 3 percent in closing cost assistance toward the purchase of a property that’s been foreclosed and is now owned by Fannie Mae.This program isn’t for everyone, however: Not only are you limited in your choice of properties, but the options (like many foreclosed homes) might need lots of repairs. Energy-efficient mortgage (EEM) Making green upgrades can be costly, but you can get an energy-efficient mortgage (EEM) (either a conventional loan or one backed by the FHA or VA) to help finance them. This type of mortgage allows you to tack the cost of energy-efficient upgrades (think new insulation, a more efficient HVAC system or double-pane windows) onto your primary loan, without requiring a larger down payment. However, EEMs come with larger mortgage payments (since you’re borrowing more), and there are certain requirements, including an energy assessment. Those larger payments might be worth it, though, as you could wind up saving on your utility bills in the long run. Native American Direct Loan (NADL) and Section 184 program The Native American Direct Loan (NADL), guaranteed by the VA, and Section 184 loan, guaranteed by HUD, provide financing to eligible Native American homebuyers. A Section 184 loan requires just 2.25 percent down. The NADL program has no down payment requirement, but is only for Native American veterans and their spouses. First-time homebuyer programs by state Each U.S. state operates a housing finance authority (HFA) that serves to encourage homeownership, among other responsibilities. Here are these HFAs and other first-time buyer resources by region: Midwest Caret Down Housing finance agency Mortgage lenders Illinois Housing Development Authority Illinois mortgage lenders Indiana Housing & Community Development Authority Indiana mortgage lenders Iowa Finance Authority Iowa mortgage lenders Kansas Housing Resources Corporation Kansas mortgage lenders Michigan State Housing Development Authority Michigan mortgage lenders Minnesota Housing Finance Agency Minnesota mortgage lenders Missouri Housing Development Commission Missouri mortgage lenders Nebraska Investment Finance Authority Nebraska mortgage lenders North Dakota Housing Finance Agency North Dakota mortgage lenders Ohio Housing Finance Agency Ohio mortgage lenders South Dakota Housing Development Authority South Dakota mortgage lenders Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority Wisconsin mortgage lenders Northeast Caret Down Housing finance agency Mortgage lenders Connecticut Housing Finance Authority Connecticut mortgage lenders Maine State Housing Authority Maine mortgage lenders Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development Massachusetts mortgage lenders New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority New Hampshire mortgage lenders New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency New Jersey mortgage lenders State of New York Mortgage Agency New York mortgage lenders Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency Pennsylvania mortgage lenders Rhode Island Housing Rhode Island mortgage lenders Vermont Housing Finance Agency Vermont mortgage lenders South Caret Down Housing finance agency Mortgage lenders Alabama Housing Finance Authority Alabama mortgage lenders Arkansas Development Finance Authority Arkansas mortgage lenders Delaware State Housing Authority Delaware mortgage lenders Florida Housing Finance Corporation Florida mortgage lenders Georgia Department of Community Affairs Georgia mortgage lenders Kentucky Housing Corporation Kentucky mortgage lenders Louisiana Housing Corporation Louisiana mortgage lenders Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development Maryland mortgage lenders Mississippi Home Corporation Mississippi mortgage lenders North Carolina Housing Finance Agency North Carolina mortgage lenders Oklahoma Housing Finance Agency Oklahoma mortgage lenders South Carolina State Housing Finance & Development Authority South Carolina mortgage lenders Tennessee Housing Development Agency Tennessee mortgage lenders Texas first-time homebuyer programsTexas Department of Housing and Community Affairs Texas mortgage lenders Virginia Housing Virginia mortgage lenders District of Columbia Housing Finance Agency Washington, D.C. mortgage lenders West Virginia Housing Development Fund West Virginia mortgage lenders West Caret Down Housing finance agency Mortgage lenders Alaska Housing Finance Corporation Alaska mortgage lenders Arizona Industrial Development Authority Arizona mortgage lenders California Housing Finance Agency California mortgage lenders Colorado Housing and Finance Authority Colorado mortgage lenders Hawaii Housing Finance & Development Corporation Hawaii mortgage lenders Idaho Housing and Finance Association Idaho mortgage lenders Montana Housing Montana mortgage lenders Nevada Housing Division Nevada mortgage lenders New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority New Mexico mortgage lenders Oregon Housing and Community Services Oregon mortgage lenders Utah Housing Corporation Utah mortgage lenders Washington State Housing Finance Commission Washington mortgage lenders Wyoming Community Development Authority Wyoming mortgage lenders Nonprofit programs Nonprofit program options tend to be reserved for first-time homebuyers with incomes that are significantly lower than the median income in their area, or buyers who fit certain demographic or other criteria. Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America The Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA) is a nonprofit that provides low-rate mortgages to low- and moderate-income borrowers without requiring a down payment or closing costs or any mortgage insurance. The nonprofit doesn’t use credit scores to qualify you, either: Instead, it looks at other factors such as rent payment history. Habitat for Humanity If your annual income is 60 percent or less of the median income in your area, you might qualify for Habitat for Humanity’s homeownership program. Along with not exceeding the income threshold, you’ll need to contribute sweat equity​​ — in other words, help build the home or a home for another applicant — to qualify. Employer-sponsored programs Employer-assisted housing (EAH) programs help employees with housing needs, usually in neighborhoods near the workplace. This assistance can come in many forms, such as a forgivable loan coupled with required homeownership education. EAH programs are often limited to certain occupations, and there could be other restrictions, such as a first-time homebuyer or specific tenure requirement, or income limits. First-time homebuyer programs for students If you recently graduated from college, you might be eligible for help buying your first home. For example, the state of Ohio offers a Grants for Grads program with up to 5 percent down payment assistance for anyone who finished an academic program in the last 48 months. These programs typically come with a requirement to stay put for a given time (in Ohio, it’s five years), or else you’ll need to repay the funds. How to apply for a first-time homebuyer loan or program Your mortgage lender can help you determine whether you qualify for a first-time homebuyer program, as well as apply for one if you do. You can also check out your state’s housing finance agency (HFA) website to learn eligibility criteria and take next steps to apply. There will be forms to fill out, but the payoff can make the investment well worth the time. First-time homebuyer FAQ Who qualifies for first-time homebuyer programs? Caret Down A first-time homebuyer refers to a homebuyer who hasn’t owned a home previously. However, in terms of qualifying for a first-time buyer program, it often doesn’t have to be your very first time. Many programs define “first-time homebuyer” as a buyer who hasn’t owned a home within the past three years. Depending on the program, the qualifications might also include not exceeding a certain income or buying a home above a specific price point. Which loan is best for first-time homebuyers? Caret Down The best type of mortgage for a first-time homebuyer (or any borrower) is one that’s affordable. This might mean a loan that has a lower interest rate, lower down payment requirement, low or no mortgage insurance and other ways to save.That said, many first-time buyers go with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage because the monthly payments are lower and more predictable. Two popular 30-year fixed-rate choices: conventional loans and FHA loans. What are first-time homebuyer education programs? Caret Down First-time homebuyer education programs are designed to help you understand the various aspects of owning a home. To qualify for many first-time buyer loan programs, you’ll need to take a course. If you’re obtaining a conventional loan, you might be able to take the Fannie Mae HomeView online class to satisfy this requirement.

"Loan buybacks haven’t disappeared, but they are trending down - HousingWire","Loan buybacks haven’t disappeared, but they are trending down  HousingWire","Thu, 18 Apr 2024 15:57:30 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sb2FuLWJ1eWJhY2tzLWhhdmVudC1kaXNhcHBlYXJlZC1idXQtdGhleS1hcmUtdHJlbmRpbmctZG93bi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"As of third-quarter 2023, the most recent data available, Freddie Mac’s repurchase volume was $384 million, with Fannie Mae’s volume at $382 million. The report notes, however, that “in Q3 2023, Freddie repurchases fell 35% from the prior quarter while Fannie’s fell only 12%.” Brett Ludden is managing director and co-head of the financial services team at Sterling Point Advisors, a merger and acquisitions advisory firm. He is also the co-founder and managing partner of Augment Analytics. “We’re seeing a downward trend in total [loans] repurchased [on a dollar basis], and that’s true for both Fannie and Freddie,” Ludden said. “I anticipate that trend continues for both. “… But the data [for Q3 2023] indicate that Freddie’s repurchase rates are going down at a much faster pace [than Fannie’s]. … We’ll get more definitive data when we get the fourth-quarter results to see if the trends continue at that point.” A report from the Urban Institute focused on Fannie and Freddie loan repurchase rates shows that the GSEs in recent years “have become more aggressive, forcing more repurchases earlier in the life of the loan than was the case in earlier vintages.” The Urban Institute report, published in November 2023, shows that the average number of months from origination to repurchase between 2005 to 2008 (prior to and during the early stages of the global financial crisis) was 46 months for Freddie Mac and 52 months for Fannie Mae. From 2018 through Q1 2023, however, that same figure was 11 months for Freddie and 13 months for Fannie. Policing loans Even as the agencies have become more aggressive in loan repurchases in the past several years, particularly in the wake of record origination volumes in 2020 and 2021, data seems to indicate that lenders have also become more vigilant in policing loan originations to ensure quality control (QC). ACES Quality Management, a fintech that provides quality-control software for the financial services industry, issued a Mortgage QC Industry Trends report with data through Q3 2023. The report provides a quarter-by-quarter critical-defect rate for mortgages (primarily Fannie, Freddie and Federal Housing Administration loans) that were analyzed via its software. According to the ACES report, the critical-defect rate declined from 2.47% in third-quarter 2022 to 1.67% in Q3 2023, the most recent data available. The report defines a critical defect as one that “would result in the loan being uninsurable or ineligible for sale.” One of the QC efforts now underway to stem agency loan repurchase demands was launched by Fannie Mae this past September. It mandates, among other measures, that companies that sell loans to the agency must complete monthly prefunding reviews on either 10% of its prior month’s loan originations or 750 loans, whichever is less. Because loan repurchase data from the GSEs is only current through the third quarter of 2023, it’s still too early to tell if Fannie Mae’s program will have a material impact on its repurchase demands. “Repurchases have been a hot topic for lenders, and to some degree, the agencies and investors have gotten a bad rap in these discussions,” said Nick Volpe, executive vice president of ACES Quality Management. “It makes sense that the investors are asking lenders to ward off as many problems as possible [via QC efforts] before a loan is made. “The overarching goal of prefunding QC is to ward off problems before they become issues on closed loans. The problem obviously is bad loans that lead to repurchase and indemnification.” Non-QM vigilance Pamela Hamrick, president of Incenter Diligence Solutions, which provides due-diligence reviews and document management services for the mortgage industry, said that prefunding reviews are also gaining more traction in the nonqualified mortgage (non-QM) space. Non-QM loans are those that cannot be purchased by the GSEs. The pool of non-QM borrowers includes real estate investors, foreign nationals, business owners, gig workers and the self-employed, as well as a smaller group of homebuyers who face credit challenges, such as past bankruptcies. “There are a lot more of the non-QM and DSCR (debt-service-coverage ratio) loans than there have been in the past,” Hamrick said. “And those loans are historically riskier than a typical conventional loan.” She added that a growing share of non-QM lenders are starting to “embrace more QC prefunding eligibility reviews … because they have major concerns about liquidity in the secondary market for their non-QM and DSCR loans.” “If a lender closes a loan and a mistake is discovered, it’s likely that their loan won’t get purchased,” Hamrick explained. “So, having a prefunding eligibility review better ensures that the loan transaction can be problem free.” John Levonick is a senior partner with the law firm Garris Horn LLP, which serves mortgage companies, secondary market investors, quality control firms, third-party review firms and others in the financial services space. He also previously served as CEO of Canopy, a third-party review firm. Levonick said that in today’s market, the economics have shifted toward encouraging more quality control reviews at the originator level. “The presumption is that the investors give better pricing for the loans if they have been [run through a quality control review] by the originator,” he added. “And when that happens, the investor will purchase the loans and also purchase the rights to the due diligence through what’s called a reliance letter, which permits the investor to rely on the work done for the lender as if it was done for the investor [satisfying regulator and rating agency requirements]. “So, the lender, regardless of size, has to come out of pocket and pay for the due diligence, but then they allegedly recapture that cost through better execution [of the loan sale to the end investor].” A&D Mortgage is one example of an originator that is committed to prefunding quality control reviews. Alexander Suslov, the company’s head of capital markets, said that originators perform prefunding reviews on 100% of A&D’s overall loan production, including its non-QM originations. “Because we do 100% of the prefunding review, we didn’t have that many loan repurchases for it to be super alerting,” Suslov said. “With the little increase that we had, it simply alerted us that we need to be more careful [in certain areas].” Future technology Alan Qureshi, managing partner of Blue Water Financial Technologies — a technology solutions provider for the secondary mortgage market that also offers risk management services — said he holds out great hope for the future of tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and digital quality control reviews in helping to level the playing field in the mortgage market, including on the loan repurchase front. “Because of the nature of buybacks and because of the non-standardization of loan delivery, I have a fundamental problem around counterparty selection in a market where the big get bigger and the small, well, they get cast aside, but that’s not good for the consumer,” Qureshi said. “The flip side is if I instead have a platform that leverages technology (such as AI and optical character recognition software, or OCR) to essentially level the playing field. That’s a much better outcome and solution for the industry.” Verus Mortgage Capital is an aggregator and affiliate of asset manager and investment adviser Invictus Capital Partners, which sponsors a nonagency securitization platform. Verus has acquired more than $30 billion in residential loans and completed 58 securitizations since its inception, according to Dane Smith, Verus’ senior managing director and president. “There’s a lot of stakeholders throughout the mortgage ecosystem, and due diligence is kind of the common thread that allows … [loan] documents [assembled in a PDF file] to be turned into an institutional-quality asset,” Smith said. In a business that is inherently high volume and high stakes, Smith also said advances in technology — including on the AI and OCR front — promise to create even greater efficiencies and accuracy in the system at all levels. He stresses, however, that the industry is still a long way from removing all human touch and judgment from the quality control process, which is essentially the bond of trust holding the system together. “We buy loans from over 100 different mortgage banks in a given month,” Smith said, “… and we’ve been working with and training a [generative AI] system on our [non-QM] guidelines.” He stressed that the AI system is still in development and not in general use at this point. “We’ve been training it just so you can ask a question, and it can give you the various guidelines in response,” Smith explained. “So, we’re much closer [to AI underwriting in the non-QM space], but I still think there’s still a pretty decent ways to go before you could upload all the mortgage docs, and it can understand what type of loan it is, or it could understand and underwrite the loan, and it could bump it up against guidelines. “ …There’s lots of ways we can use AI to increase productivity. Unfortunately, we’re still a ways from decisioning and underwriting and QC.“",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AdobeStock_396094113.jpeg,2024-04-18,-0.291,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Dane Smith', 'description': 'Canadian basketball player', 'full_name': 'Dane Smith'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sterling', 'latitude': 39.006221771240234, 'longitude': -77.42859649658203, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ludden', 'latitude': 46.00917053222656, 'longitude': -98.12667083740234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Institute', 'latitude': 35.35765838623047, 'longitude': -77.71385955810547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ACES', 'latitude': 43.43333053588867, 'longitude': -6.066669940948486, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hamrick', 'latitude': 35.80984115600586, 'longitude': -82.19901275634766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Garris', 'latitude': 43.343299865722656, 'longitude': -1.059999942779541, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Suslov', 'latitude': 58.56639862060547, 'longitude': 70.14450073242188, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Qureshi', 'latitude': 28.258670806884766, 'longitude': 68.93536376953125, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Smith', 'latitude': 39.32038116455078, 'longitude': -77.27220916748047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae's repurchase volume was $382 million in Q3 2023, a 12% decrease from the previous quarter.

FHFA annual report highlights GSE actions on affordable housing - HousingWire,FHFA annual report highlights GSE actions on affordable housing  HousingWire,"Thu, 18 Apr 2024 17:57:33 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9maGZhLWFubnVhbC1yZXBvcnQtaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy1nc2UtYWN0aW9ucy1vbi1hZmZvcmRhYmxlLWhvdXNpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) this week released its annual Housing Mission Report, offering insights into the actions the agency took in 2023 on a host of issues. These include oversight of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, mortgage purchases designed to improve affordability for low-income homeowners, vendor partnerships and investments in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. All told, the GSEs purchased more than 136,000 single-family mortgages to low- and moderate-income homebuyers last year through the HomeReady and Home Possible programs. They also added “enhancements” to the programs themselves, including the addition of “a credit of $2,500 for very low-income borrowers that lenders must pass through to borrowers by applying it to the down payment or closing costs,” the report stated. The GSEs also purchased 15,000 Special Purpose Credit Program (SPCP) loans “through both lender-sponsored initiatives and their proprietary SPCPs.” These are designed to support homeownership efforts for borrowers in underserved communities. Through the HomeReady First SPCP, Fannie Mae acquired 921 loans with a total of more than $5 million in down payment or closing cost assistance, the report stated. Seventy-nine percent of participating borrowers self-identified as “members of historically underserved groups.” Fannie also purchased 4,747 loans through lender-sponsored SPCPs in which 81% of borrowers self-identified as part of such groups. Freddie Mac’s BorrowSmart Access SPCP saw the acquisition of 2,462 loans “with close to $4 million in down payment or closing cost assistance,” according to the report. The GSE also purchased 6,828 loans originated through lender-sponsored SPCPs. More than half (57%) of these loans were “obtained by underserved borrowers.” Nearly 9,300 households took advantage of either Freddie Mac’s program or its support for lender-sponsored SPCPs. Stemming from its equitable housing finance plans, FHFA also oversaw the GSEs’ partnerships with certain vendors to make more rent-payment data available to credit bureaus from participating multifamily housing property owners. Rent payment data gives renters a more efficient avenue to either establish or strengthen their credit profiles. Nearly 3,000 multifamily properties were added last year to the GSEs’ programs. Through Fannie Mae, 27,845 renters established credit profiles while 117,182 renters strengthened their existing profiles. Freddie Mac had 55,300 renters establish profiles and 304,194 strengthen them, according to the report. The GSEs also “invested over $1.7 billion last year in [LIHTC] equity, including transactions that support housing in Duty to Serve-designated rural areas, preserve affordable housing, support mixed-income housing, provide supportive housing, or meet other affordable housing objectives.” More than 90% of these LIHTC investments by the GSEs, or some $1.6 billion, were made in “targeted transactions,” meaning they were investments that either support housing in Duty to Serve-designated rural areas or “meet other affordable housing objectives defined by FHFA,” the report explained. “FHFA maintains a keen focus on ensuring the entities we regulate fulfill their missions to support access to housing opportunities in a safe and sound manner,” FHFA Director Sandra Thompson said in an announcement of the report. “Ongoing affordability challenges throughout the country only heighten the importance of this responsibility.”",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AdobeStock_301407574_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg,2024-04-18,0.116,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Low', 'latitude': 53.00667190551758, 'longitude': -0.9980599880218506, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Duty', 'latitude': 19.649999618530273, 'longitude': -72.30000305175781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]","Fannie Mae purchased over 136,000 mortgages for low- and moderate-income homebuyers through HomeReady and Home Possible programs, adding enhancements like a $2,500 credit for very low-income borrowers.

Mortgage Lenders View TSPs as Indispensable (but Expensive) Partners - Fannie Mae,Mortgage Lenders View TSPs as Indispensable (but Expensive) Partners  Fannie Mae,"Thu, 18 Apr 2024 13:59:17 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhbm5pZW1hZS5jb20vcmVzZWFyY2gtYW5kLWluc2lnaHRzL3BlcnNwZWN0aXZlcy9tb3J0Z2FnZS1sZW5kZXJzLXZpZXctdHNwcy1pbmRpc3BlbnNhYmxlLWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1wYXJ0bmVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fannie Mae,"Over the past decade, as mortgage-related services have increasingly moved toward digitalization, Technology Service Providers (TSPs) have become an essential part of lenders' day-to-day operations. Mortgage lenders leverage TSP technology offerings to help improve loan quality, reduce origination cycle time, and drive a better customer experience, among other benefits. Earlier this year, Fannie Mae's Economic and Strategic Research (ESR) Group surveyed nearly 200 senior mortgage executives to better understand how they feel about the TSP marketplace, as well as their experiences with the various services offered. Our survey considered solutions and applications spanning the entire mortgage lending life cycle, including those related to point of sale (POS) systems, borrower credit reporting, verification of borrower income / employment / assets (VOI/E/A), loan origination systems (LOS), appraisals, closing, servicing, compliance, and business analytics. Among the key findings: When selecting TSPs, lenders cited cost considerations, functionality, and integration capabilities as the most important criteria. These criteria were also the top three listed in 2016, when we last surveyed lenders on this topic. This time around, however, cost considerations leapfrogged the others to become the most important criterion; in 2016, integration was cited as most important. TSP technology offerings for LOS and POS solutions are considered by most lenders as business critical (or ""must haves""). Given their criticality, LOS and POS solutions also ranked highest in terms of total TSP investment, which includes headcount and/or budget invested toward implementation and usage. The majority of respondents reported that the value they receive from their LOS TSP investments matches or exceeds their expectations, but many believe that there are too few competitors in this space. By contrast, lenders see the investment returns on VOI/E/A and credit reporting TSP solutions as delivering the least value relative to expectations. Here, too, many respondents believe there to be a lack of competitive offerings. Click image above for larger view As part of the survey, we also encouraged lenders to share their thoughts about the TSP marketplace generally and the value of their investments. In their comments, lenders expressed particular frustration with the rising cost of TSP solutions, which many believe is driven by a lack of competition. This frustration was most prevalent among TSP solutions focused on LOS, borrower credit reporting, and borrower VOI/E/A. Some lenders pointed out that the costs in these areas have climbed and continue to rise, leading to significantly increased loan origination costs and, because these expenses are sometimes passed through to consumers, higher borrower closing costs. Click image above for larger view Mortgage lenders face tremendous cost pressures in today's higher rate, lower volume business environment. Many of the lenders surveyed mentioned that they would like to see more competition in the TSP marketplace to help alleviate some of these costs, but they also acknowledged that the barriers to entry in the technology space are often high. Additionally, respondents noted that new entrants' functionalities might be limited, and the up-front integration challenges, which are typically costly, could discourage many lenders from even considering new providers. Furthermore, even for the functional areas in which lenders believe there is ample competition, some commented that they lack the bandwidth to research new options. In the end, while the mortgage lending community views TSPs as indispensable partners, the rising costs required to implement, maintain, and use their services is top of mind for many lenders.

The data, contained in Fannie Mae’s latest Home Price Index, shows that’s up from the previous quarter’s revised annual growth rate of 6.6%. “Home prices continued to rise in the first quarter as the housing market remained seriously supply constrained,” said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “The stabilization of mortgage rates in the 6.6% to 6.7% range in January helped to boost demand early in the first quarter, with existing home sales and mortgage applications both rising. Mortgage rates have trended upward again of late, but there is support for home prices in strong demographic demand from younger generations. We expect home sales to rise modestly this year as potential homebuyers appear to be acclimating to the higher-rate environment and, in some cases, may be less able to put off moving for life reasons.” On a quarterly basis, home prices were up a seasonally adjusted 1.7%. That’s flat from the growth reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. And, looking on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, home prices were also up 1.7% in the first quarter.

When Will Mortgage Rates Go Down to 3%? - Norada Real Estate Investments,When Will Mortgage Rates Go Down to 3%?

The answer is not anytime soon, according to most experts and forecasts. In fact, mortgage rates are expected to stay above 6% for most of 2024, and only gradually decline by the end of the year. Mortgage Rates and Influencing Factors Mortgage rates are influenced by many factors, such as the supply and demand for housing, the economic growth, the inflation, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, and the global market conditions. In 2023, mortgage rates soared to their highest levels in decades, as the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate six times to combat rising inflation and overheating economy. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate reached 8.45% in October 2023, considered to be the highest level for 30-year rates since 2000. Thereafter, in less than two months since October's historic high-water mark, 30-year mortgage rates dropped back down to about 7%. Now, the Fed has paused its rate hikes, as inflation has started to moderate and economic growth has slowed down. The Fed also signaled that it expects to cut its interest rate three times in 2024, as it sees a more balanced outlook for the economy. This has led to a drop in mortgage rates, which fell to 6.60% in January 2024. But don't expect mortgage rates to fall much further in the near future. Most forecasts agree that mortgage rates will remain above 7% for most of 2024, as the Fed will still be cautious about cutting rates too quickly or too deeply. Projections from Different Sources Goldman Sachs Research: The analysts expect the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to be 7.6% at the end of 2023, and 7.1% at the end of 2024. Forbes Advisor: The experts predict that mortgage rates will average 7.5% in the first quarter of 2024, dropping to 6.9% in the second quarter, and falling to 6.5% by the end of the year. U.S. News: The publication forecasts that mortgage rates will continue to fall to 6.3% by the end of 2024. Mortgage Bankers Association: The trade group projects that mortgage rates will slide to 6.1% by the end of 2024. Fannie Mae: The government-sponsored enterprise expects that mortgage rates will dip to 6.5% by the end of 2024. Bright MLS: The real estate listing service anticipates that mortgage rates will decline to 6.2% by the end of 2024. As you can see, none of these forecasts expect mortgage rates to go down to 3% in 2024. In fact, that level of mortgage rates has not been seen since early 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a historic plunge in interest rates and a surge in refinancing activity. Implications for Homebuyers and Homeowners So what does this mean for you as a homebuyer or homeowner? It means that you should not wait for mortgage rates to drop significantly before making your move. If you are ready to buy a home or refinance your existing mortgage, you should act sooner rather than later, as mortgage rates are still relatively low compared to historical averages. You should also shop around for the best mortgage rate and terms for your situation, as different lenders may offer different deals. Mortgage rates are unpredictable and can change quickly depending on various factors. Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the market trends and news, and consult with a trusted mortgage professional who can help you navigate the process and find the best option for you.",https://www.noradarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/when-will-mortgage-rates-go-down-to-3.jpeg,2024-04-19,-0.447,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Forbes', 'latitude': 45.943580627441406, 'longitude': -98.78205108642578, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]","Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored enterprise, forecasts that mortgage rates will dip to 6.5% by the end of 2024.

"Home Sales Tumble, But There's Hope for a Turnaround - National Association of REALTORS®","Home Sales Tumble, But There's Hope for a Turnaround  National Association of REALTORS®","Thu, 18 Apr 2024 17:46:12 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hci5yZWFsdG9yL21hZ2F6aW5lL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLW5ld3MvaG9tZS1zYWxlcy10dW1ibGUtYnV0LXRoZXJlcy1ob3BlLWZvci1hLXR1cm5hcm91bmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,National Association of REALTORS®,"The spring housing market is off to a sluggish start, with home sales falling in March. Economists say a resurgence in mortgage rates and inflation could be softening sales at the start of what is traditionally real estate’s busiest season. Despite the headwinds, sellers continue to see home prices grow, buyers’ appetite for housing remains high and bidding wars are still occurring. On top of that, a growing job market may offer some rosier prospects for more sales. Existing-home sales dropped 4.3% in March compared to the previous month and are nearly 4% lower than a year ago, the National Association of REALTORS® reported Thursday. While more listings came on the market last month, the increased competition among sellers didn’t appear to hurt home prices. The median existing-home sales price increased 4.8%, reaching $393,500—the highest price ever recorded for March, NAR reports. Meanwhile, builders pressed the brakes on new-home construction, sensing buyer hesitancy from rising mortgage rates. Builders also reported facing higher construction costs and tighter lending conditions last month. The Commerce Department reported this week that permits for single-family housing starts dropped to a five-month low, indicating a slowdown in future construction as well. Spring Thaw? Nevertheless, homebuying and selling sentiment remains strong, according to Fannie Mae’s latest Home Purchase Sentiment Index. “Both our ‘good time to buy’ and ‘good time to sell’ measures continued their slow upward drift this month,” says Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae’s chief economist. “However, consumers took a slightly more pessimistic view on the likely direction of mortgage rates, reflecting the fact that actual mortgage rates have moved upward since the start of the year. With the historically low rates of the pandemic era now firmly behind us, some households appear to be moving past the hurdle of last year’s sharp jump in rates, an adjustment that we think could help further thaw the housing market.” Fannie Mae predicts a gradual increase in sales transactions and home listings this year. Indeed, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun notes there are nearly 6 million more jobs compared to pre-COVID highs. That “suggests more aspiring home buyers exist in the market,” he says. Latest Housing Data Existing home sales fell in March in the Midwest, South and West but rose in the Northeast for the first time in about four months. Here’s a closer look at key housing indicators from NAR’s latest report: Housing inventories are rising: Total housing inventory was up nearly 5% compared to February and up 14.4% from a year ago. “More inventory is always welcomed in the current environment,” Yun says. “Frankly, it’s a great time to list, with ongoing multiple offers on mid-priced properties and, overall, home prices continuing to rise.” Home prices climb: The median existing-home price for all housing types was $393,500, up 4.8% compared to a year earlier. All four major regions of the U.S. posted price gains last month, led by the Northeast and Midwest. Days on the market up slightly from a year ago: Properties typically remained on the market for 33 days. That is a quicker pace than the 38 days recorded in February but is up from 29 days a year ago. First-time buyers are increasing: The share of sales to first-time home buyers grew to 32%, up from 26% in February and 28% from a year earlier. All-cash sales still remain high: All-cash sales comprised 28% of transactions, down from 33% in February but up from 27% a year earlier. Individual investors and second-home buyers tend to make up the biggest bulk of all-cash sales. They accounted for 15% of sales, up slightly from 17% a year ago. Regional Breakdown Here’s a closer look at how home sales fared across the country in March, according to NAR’s report: Northeast: Existing-home sales rose 4.2%, reaching an annual rate of 500,000. Home sales are down 3.8% from a year ago. Median price: $434,600, up 9.9% from one year ago. Midwest: Sales dropped 1.9% compared to a month ago, reaching an annual rate of 1.01 million. Sales are down 1% from the prior year. Median price: $292,400, up 7.5% from March 2023. South: Sales fell 5.9% compared to February, settling in at an annual rate of 1.9 million. Sales are 5% lower than a year earlier. Median price: $359,100, up 3.4% from last year. West: Sales decreased 8.2% from a month ago, reaching an annual rate of 780,000.

Newly introduced enhancements to these programs included the addition of a $2,500 credit to assist very low-income borrowers with down payments and closing costs.

On a quarterly basis, home prices rose a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent in Q1 2024, essentially the same as the growth in Q4 2023. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, home prices also increased by 1.7 percent in Q1 2024. ""Home prices continued to rise in the first quarter as the housing market remained seriously supply constrained,"" said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. ""The stabilization of mortgage rates in the 6.6 to 6.7 percent range in January helped to boost demand early in the first quarter, with existing home sales and mortgage applications both rising. Mortgage rates have trended upward again of late, but there is support for home prices in strong demographic demand from younger generations. We expect home sales to rise modestly this year as potential homebuyers appear to be acclimating to the higher-rate environment and, in some cases, may be less able to put off moving for life reasons."" The FNM-HPI is produced by aggregating county-level data to create both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted national indices that are representative of the whole country and designed to serve as indicators of general single-family home price trends. The FNM-HPI is publicly available at the national level as a quarterly series with a start date of Q1 1975 and extending to the most recent quarter, Q1 2024. Fannie Mae publishes the FNM-HPI approximately mid-month during the first month of each new quarter.

McCargo, who was sworn in as the 18th president of Ginnie Mae in December 2021, will step down from her post on May 3. She is notable for being the first woman and the first woman of color to head Ginnie Mae, or officially, the Government National Mortgage Association. Before being nominated by President Joe Biden to helm Ginnie, McCargo had served in the administration since January 2021, appointed as a senior advisor for housing finance for Marcia Fudge, then secretary of HUD. Her career in housing started long before her entry into HUD; prior to her appointment, she was vice president of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, focused on narrowing the racial homeownership gap and eliminating barriers to minority credit access. She also held leadership roles at the Mortgage Servicing Collaborative, CoreLogic, and JP Morgan Chase, and worked for a decade at Fannie Mae on secondary mortgage market and policy development. “The past 3.5 years in public service with the Biden-Harris administration has been the most important and fulfilling work of my 25-year career in housing finance, and I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve my country and advance a bold housing agenda across the globe as president of Ginnie Mae,” McCargo said in a statement. “I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished together and grateful for the housing leadership this Administration and agency have demonstrated since our first day in office. “This has been a deeply personal decision to return to private life,” McCargo concluded. Acting HUD Secretary Adrianne Todman, who replaced Fudge upon her resignation earlier this year, thanked McCargo for her service. “In her time at the agency, she has been a zealous advocate for housing affordability and ensuring a more equitable housing finance system,” Todman said. “As President of Ginnie Mae, Alanna has helped expand Ginnie Mae’s reach in serving historically underserved communities and has been a champion for advancing market-driven initiatives that support mortgage programs across the government. “It has been a joy to work with President McCargo. I am proud to say that she has left Ginnie Mae stronger than when she arrived, and her tenure sets a high standard for servant leadership.” Bob Broeksmit, president and CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), likewise offered his gratitude for McCargo’s leadership, highlighting her work on affordable housing initiatives and improving the function of capital markets during her tenure. “We commend President McCargo and her staff for their contributions on numerous issues, including supporting mortgage servicers in their commitment to helping struggling homeowners enter and exit COVID-19 forbearance programs, investing in technology to improve the experience for issuers, and enhancing liquidity for Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities,” he said.",https://www.scotsmanguide.com/files/sites/2/2023/01/f0b643ab_ginniemaelogo.jpg,2024-04-19,0.433,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HUD', 'latitude': 53.64799880981445, 'longitude': -1.784999966621399, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 39.608978271484375, 'longitude': -78.94029998779297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Institute', 'latitude': 35.35765838623047, 'longitude': -77.71385955810547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Biden', 'latitude': 5.229050159454346, 'longitude': -1.0081199407577515, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Harris', 'latitude': -40.76667022705078, 'longitude': 175.5500030517578, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Administration', 'latitude': 32.22787857055664, 'longitude': 35.22243118286133, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'President', 'latitude': 42.50199890136719, 'longitude': 1.5119999647140503, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Alanna', 'latitude': 13.266670227050781, 'longitude': 25.549999237060547, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MBA', 'latitude': -1.6971800327301025, 'longitude': 37.618080139160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]",Not-related content.

She was an incredible woman with a uniquely wonderful way of touching the lives of everyone she met. If you knew her, you were blessed. She was a strong Southern woman, the bless your heart kind, who could do it all; family, career, and home while still serving the community with her huge servant’s heart. She was a devoted wife, mother, daughter, and friend, who also influenced many young people in her 33 years as an educator. She was born to Theodore Solomon and Fannie Mae Solomon on July 5th, 1937, and spent her youth in Wilmington and Kannapolis. She met her true love, Murphy Osborne, at High Point College and they married. Janice and Murphy shared a wonderful life together full of family, friends, travel, and faithful devotion not only to each other but also to their faith. Their love for each other was immeasurable and they faced the joys and the challenges of their lives hand in hand. They were married for more than 67 years and never tired of sharing each other’s company. They completed each other. To her daughters, Janice was the perfect example of a Christian servant, showing them how to be women of character, faith, and strength by example. To her grandsons, she was magical! To her friends, she was loyal and helped share the burdens and joys of life. To her students, she was the favorite teacher, leaving an impression far beyond what she taught them academically. If you were one of her “projects”, you were blessed immensely. She was involved with many organizations, often in a leadership role but some of her happiest memories were the years spent as the Co-Chairman of the First Baptist Church Clothing Ministry, where she touched many lives with her compassion, serving as the hands and feet of Jesus Christ for more than 30 years. She will be truly missed by everyone she loved and served. Janice is survived by her devoted husband, Dr. Murphy M. Osborne, Jr.; daughters, Cindy Jones (Skip) and Lisa Blackwood (Geary); grandsons, Street Jones (Ashton), Blake Painter, Liam McGeever, Daniel McGeever: brother Ted Solomon (Melanie); great grandchildren, E Jones and Wells Jones; sister-in-law Jean Wheeling: lifelong friend, Lorraine Griffin. Janice was predeceased by her father, Theodore Solomon; her mother, Fannie Mae Solomon; her brother, Ed Solomon; her stepmother, Lucille Solomon. The family would like to thank the Springmoor staff and Hospice for the loving and tender care that was given to her.

Fannie & Freddie stock double after election Two stocks that have surged on the Trump rally are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Shares of the housing government sponsored enterprises, which buy and package mortgages, have nearly doubled in price over the last two weeks on expectations that Trump will be favorable to investors. One of those investors is Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, which purchased a sizable stake in 2013, making the hedge fund mogul the largest shareholder in both companies. Instagram targets Snapchat with disappearing photos, live video Turning to the world of social media, Instagram is trying to turn up the heat on Snapchat. Instagram, owned by Facebook, announcing it will offer live video streaming, as well as video and photos that disappear. And yes, disappearing media is what helped make Snapchat a huge success, with more than 150 million daily users. But no, Snapchat does not have live video—at least not yet.

Decisions on interest rates, influenced by economic data and inflation targets, directly impact the cost of borrowing. The Fed's signaled interest rate cuts could lead to a decrease in mortgage rates, fostering a more favorable borrowing environment. Inflation: Inflation remains one of the most significant factors affecting mortgage rates. Efforts to curb inflation could result in adjustments to interest rates, with higher inflation typically leading to higher mortgage rates to counteract the economy's overheating. Economic Growth: The overall health of the economy plays a crucial role. Strong economic indicators might push rates up as demand for credit increases, while signs of a slowdown could lead to decreases in an effort to stimulate borrowing and investment. Housing Market Dynamics: The balance of supply and demand in the housing market will also impact rates. A surplus of homes could lead to lower rates to encourage buying, whereas a shortage might drive rates up as competition for available homes increases. Global Events: International events, such as geopolitical conflicts or global economic downturns, can affect investor confidence and lead to fluctuations in mortgage rates as investors seek safer assets like U.S. Treasury bonds, influencing yields and borrowing costs. Government Policies: Fiscal policies, including tax laws and housing regulations, can influence mortgage rates. For example, policies that stimulate housing construction can increase supply, potentially leading to lower mortgage rates. Consumer Behavior: The demand for mortgages is also shaped by consumer confidence and demographic trends. Changes in homebuyer preferences or shifts in population growth can affect the demand for mortgages and, consequently, the rates. Bond Market Movements: Mortgage rates are closely tied to the bond market, particularly the 10-year Treasury yield. As investors' perceptions of risk change, so do bond yields, which can lead to corresponding changes in mortgage rates. Banking Sector Health: The financial stability and lending practices of banks can influence mortgage rates. A robust banking sector may offer more competitive rates, while a struggling one might tighten lending and increase rates. Technological Advancements: The rise of fintech and online lending platforms has introduced more competition into the mortgage industry, which could lead to more favorable rates for consumers as companies vie for business.",https://www.noradarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mortgage-rate-predictions-for-next-2-years.jpeg,2024-04-20,0.085,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S. Treasury', 'latitude': 33.32728958129883, 'longitude': -107.71475982666016, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not-related content.

A Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that a mere 55% of adults say buying a home is the best investment families can make. That's down from 59% last November, 67% last May and 79% in June 2008. A similar question on a Fannie Mae's National Housing survey found that in 1996, a whopping 89% of Americans believed one was better off owning a home rather than renting. The new skeptics include folks like Dave Guilford, a former stockbroker and small business owner who, in November 2008, sold his Mandeville, La. home for $220,000 and put his stake in a 4-bedroom Paris rental. ""If it's up to me, we'll never own another home again, unless it's investment property and not our own residence,"" he says. ""I'm perfectly content to rent for the rest of my life."" Guilford, 40, managed to scrape some equity out of the home, which he bought for $180,000 in 2003. But he thinks he would've gotten a better return if he had put the money into stocks or a retirement savings account -- especially after watching the home's value fall from its peak of $350,000. ""Owning your principal residence is perhaps the worst investment an adult can make,"" he says. ""A lot of marketing has gone into convincing Americans that this is a good investment, when it is in fact a horrible investment for 90% of the population.""",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,2010-01-20,0.05,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'American Dream', 'latitude': 4.6327900886535645, 'longitude': -74.09188842773438, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Rasmussen', 'latitude': -19.352399826049805, 'longitude': 146.72279357910156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 46.02280044555664, 'longitude': 7.7513298988342285, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mandeville', 'latitude': 30.35824966430664, 'longitude': -90.06562805175781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Paris', 'latitude': 48.85340881347656, 'longitude': 2.34879994392395, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Guilford', 'latitude': 39.915409088134766, 'longitude': -77.6010513305664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not-related content.

Lawyers for the regulator will face off with attorneys of Nomura Holdings Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L) in a non-jury trial in Manhattan federal court, one of the few cases spilling out of the financial crisis by the U.S. government to reach trial. Barring a last-minute settlement, the trial would be the first to result from 18 lawsuits filed in 2011 by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to recover losses on some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that various banks sold Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB). The FHFA said Japan's Nomura, the securities' sponsor, and RBS, an underwriter, misstated important details of the mortgages underlying more than $2 billion in securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, which came under government control amid the economic upheaval seven years ago. The FHFA says that 68 percent of a sample of the loans were not underwritten in accordance with underwriting guidelines and that appraised values were inflated on average by 11.1 percent. Nomura and RBS deny the allegations, arguing no misleading statements were made and any false statements were immaterial. The FHFA is seeking more than $1 billion. If the banks have to pay damages, they would receive the mortgage bonds in exchange, which earlier this week were valued at $480 million. The defendants plan to call former Fannie and Freddie employees, including ex-Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd, to show that factors such as falling housing prices and rising unemployment were behind the losses. Nomura, RBS and the FHFA declined comment before trial. The banks' decision to go to trial contrasts with competitors, who cut settlements for nearly $17.9 billion following a series of adverse rulings by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote. Those other banks included Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). RBS, which paid $99.5 million to resolve claims in one of the lawsuits, faces a separate case in Connecticut federal court over $30.4 billion in mortgage-backed securities. While the U.S. government has obtained billions of dollars in settlements with banks, few cases have gone to trial. The U.S. Department of Justice last year secured an order requiring Bank of America to pay $1.26 billion after a jury found it liable for the sale of questionable mortgages to Fannie and Freddie. Unlike that case, the FHFA's lawsuit is not a law enforcement action but was brought in an investor capacity through lawyers at law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. The case against Nomura and RBS was set to go to a jury. But in January, the FHFA dropped a key federal securities law claim, enabling it to pursue the case before Cote as a bench trial. Many of Cote's rulings in the FHFA case have been favorable to the government agency, including denying bids to dismiss the case. The banks have in court filings complained about her ""gravely prejudicial"" decisions. At a hearing Monday in the FHFA case, Cote said she had already begun reviewing some of the evidence and drafting a decision, but gave no indication of which way she would rule in the trial.

Homeowners now face a new fee when refinancing - Yahoo Movies Canada,Homeowners now face a new fee when refinancing  Yahoo Movies Canada,"Sat, 20 Apr 2024 03:56:15 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvaG9tZW93bmVycy1mYWNlLW5ldy1mZWUtd2hlbi1yZWZpbmFuY2luZy0yMTMyMjEyODEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Movies Canada,"A new refinance fee is now in effect, potentially increasing the interest rate homeowners are quoted if they can’t convince the lender to waive the fee. The enactment comes as the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage hit a new low of 2.71%, marking the 14th record this year. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which supervises Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that back millions of mortgages, imposed a 0.5% fee on lenders for new refinanced mortgages starting December 1. Loans below $125,000 are exempt from the fee altogether. Mortgage rates hit all-time low: Is it time to refinance? “Most applicants will not see the fee as a cost or points charged to them,” said Tony Grech, senior mortgage loan officer at Luxury Mortgage Corp, a mortgage lender. “The refinance fee will be reflected in the interest rate rather than the fees. To the average borrower, this equals .125% to .25% higher in rate.” Why is there a fee? Under the CARES Act passed in March, homeowners struggling from a coronavirus-related hardship could postpone their mortgage payments for 180 days and receive another 180 days of forbearance, depending on their need. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government agencies backing those home loans incurred more than $6 billion in losses related to the forbearance plans. To compensate for this loss, the agencies are tagging the 0.5% fee onto new refinance loans. Here's the history of the 30-year fixed mortgage rate “In my opinion this is nothing more than a money grab,” said Scott Sheldon, branch manager at New American Funding, a mortgage lender. “And the government was very methodical in adding this fee.” Mortgage data and analytics firm, Black Knight reported that, as of December 1, 2.76 million homeowners remain in active forbearance plans, representing $561 billion in unpaid principal. Still, this is a 5.3% decline from the previous week. What can borrowers do? Borrowers should be upfront with their lenders about the fee and ask if it can be lowered or waived altogether. “On the flip side, lots of lenders —us included — on a case-by-case basis, have the ability to waive that fee anyway,” Sheldon said. “It’s going to be contingent on the lender whether to charge or eat the fee.” Borrowers can — and should — shop around to find the best deal along with a lender that is willing to absorb the fee. Record low mortgage rates: Should you cash out and refinance? Despite the new fee, homeowners likely won’t be discouraged from refinancing — given the historically low mortgage rates — and experts expect the refinance boom to continue into 2021. “We have massive demand for refinancing at the moment,” said Sheldon, whose mortgage firm in Santa Rosa, California, experienced a 74% increase in refinance volume from last year. “This fee is not deterring new mortgage loan requests and the government knows it, which is why they can collect this fee.” Dhara Singh is a reporter at Cashay and Yahoo Finance.

It might just take a little longer,” the former JPMorgan exec told Fortune this week. Almodovar runs the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which was created during the Great Depression to expand the secondary mortgage market. Today, the government-sponsored enterprise holds one-in-four U.S. mortgages and $4.3 trillion in total assets. Fannie Mae doesn't actually provide mortgages to consumers, instead they buy them from lenders and then repackage them into mortgage-backed securities which they sell to investors. This provides liquidity for the housing market, as Almodovar explained. But despite Fannie Mae’s efforts to boost the housing market, Almodovar noted that “affordability is an issue” for consumers today. She still believes there is a path to home ownership for the average American in spite of this, but it won’t be easy. The CEO recommended consumers that are frustrated with current market conditions work to improve their credit, and wait for an opportunity with the prospect of interest rate cuts on the horizon. “There’s a lot you can do in the meantime. Just get smart about what it is to be a homeowner and save and it’ll happen,” she said. Almodovar went on to explain that her two “strategic objectives” at Fannie Mae are figuring out how to make the housing market “more fair and more sustainable,” including by offering a new way for renters to build credit and qualify for mortgages. “Before, if you were a renter in this country, your rent did not count [toward your credit score],” she explained. “Through technology, Fannie Mae is taking that credit risk. If the consumer shows us their bank statements, we can tell what probably is a rent payment, the regularity of that payment, and we can make that consumer eligible.” Almodovar noted that over 500,000 rental units are reporting rent payments today, which is helping renters build sufficient credit to qualify for mortgages. Still, despite this new program and Almodovar’s optimistic outlook on the American Dream, the average American isn’t buying their first home until they turn 36 due to sky-high home prices and mortgage rates. Compared to baby boomers, who managed to buy their first homes by an average age of 29 in 1981, the American Dream has been delayed significantly for millennials and Gen Z. And Almodovar admitted that owning a home is one of the keys to what most Americans believe makes a “good life.” She even referenced how her immigrant parents bought their first home when she was growing up and it “changed the trajectory” of their lives. “At my kitchen table, I heard, like probably many American families do today, talk about a good job, education…and saving for a home,“ she said. “I still remember when I was five years old, they bought their first home. I remember the first night I slept in my room. And I think that’s informed a lot of what I do.” Despite understanding just how critical homeownership is to the American Dream, Almodovar argued that renting is a solid option right now. “A third of households are renters, and I grew up as a renter, so my bias is that being a renter is fine,” she said. Even though homeownership is still the number one way Americans build wealth, and most Americans will say it’s a necessary feature of a “good life,” Almodovar argued that the perception of renting should change. “I do believe millennials still want to be homeowners to raise a family, but it’s not the only way,” she said. “Being a renter, if you have a stable, affordable home, you have roots in your community as well.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vHsGR9WyPz8M1LnkSarX1g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_fortune_385/84a3607932a507ae8b1ffa8ade465b2f,2024-03-20,-0.452,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'American Dream', 'latitude': 4.6327900886535645, 'longitude': -74.09188842773438, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fortune', 'latitude': 35.41481018066406, 'longitude': -90.55316162109375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Almodovar', 'latitude': 40.3838996887207, 'longitude': -3.5955801010131836, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 42.950538635253906, 'longitude': -91.28929901123047, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]","Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar believes the American Dream of homeownership is still alive despite affordability challenges.

Single-family housing starts are expected to rise but at a lower rate than predicted last month. Fannie Mae’s forecasters are predicting that the Federal Reserve will leave the Fed Funds rate unchanged until Q4 2024, and then will cut twice to a rate of 5.0 percent by the end of the year. This is down from 3 cuts predicted for 2024 in last month’s forecast. However, they are still expecting the Fed Funds rate to fall to a level of 4.1 percent by the end of 2025. Fewer multifamily starts expected The current forecast for multifamily housing starts is shown in the first chart, below, along with three other recent forecasts. Fannie Mae considers any building containing more than one dwelling unit to be “multifamily”, including both condominiums and rental housing units. The multifamily starts forecasts were generally revised lower from last month’s levels. The number of starts forecast for the first quarter of 2024 and for the last quarter of 2025 were revised slightly higher. However, the forecasts for all of the quarters between were revised lower. The current forecast calls for multifamily starts to fall from a high of 387,000 annualized units in Q2 2024 to a low of 359,000 annualized units in Q1 2025. Multifamily starts are then predicted to rise slowly through the end of 2025, finishing the year at a rate of 370,000 annualized units. For reference, the most recent new residential construction report from the Census Bureau has multifamily starts running at an annualized rate of 346,000 units in Q1 2024. Looking at yearly forecasts, the predicted number of multifamily starts for 2024 was revised lower by 7,000 units to 373,000 units. The forecast for multifamily starts in 2025 was also revised lower by 7,000 units to 365,000 units. Single-family starts forecast revised higher The current forecast for single-family housing starts is shown in the next chart, below, along with three other recent forecasts. Every revision Fannie Mae’s forecasters made in this month’s forecast raised their estimate for the quarterly number of single-family starts expected. The revisions to the Q1 2024 forecast and to the forecasts for every quarter of 2025 were 60,000 or more annualized units higher. While the current forecast calls for a slight pullback in starts in Q2 2024, it sees starts growing through the rest of the forecast period, ending 2025 at an annualized rate of 1,113,000 units. Fannie Mae now expects single-family starts to be 1,024,000 units in 2024, up 44,000 units from the level forecast last month. Single-family starts in 2025 are forecast to be 1,099,000 units, up 65,000 units from the level forecast last month. Higher GDP growth expected The next chart, below, shows Fannie Mae’s current forecast for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, along with other recent forecasts. The revisions to the quarterly GDP estimates in this month’s forecast were relatively small, with no revision exceeding 0.2 percentage points. GDP growth in the Q2 2024 to Q3 2025 time span is expected to be marginally higher than predicted last month, but the rate of GDP growth at the end of 2025 is still expected to be 2.0 percent. The slowest GDP growth is now expected to be 1.6 percent, annualized, in Q4 2024. The full year forecasts for GDP growth for 2024 and 2025 were each raised 0.1 percentage point to 1.8 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. Higher CPI Inflation predicted The next chart, below, shows Fannie Mae’s current forecast for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), along with three other recent forecasts. The revisions to Fannie Mae’s CPI inflation forecast were to the upside, particularly in 2024. Forecasts for Q2 and Q3 were each revised 0.6 percentage points higher to 3.2 percent and 3.1 percent respectively. While the year-over-year inflation rate is expected to fall as low as 2.5 percent in Q2 2025, it is forecast to edge upward to 2.6 percent by the end of the year. Looking at whole-year forecasts, the forecast for year-over-year CPI inflation in Q4 2024 was raised 0.6 percentage points to 3.1 percent. The Q4 2025 year-over-year inflation forecast was left unchanged at 2.6 percent. Employment forecast higher for 2024 The next chart, below, shows Fannie Mae’s current forecast for the employment growth, along with two earlier forecasts. Employment growth is our preferred employment metric since job gains, along with productivity gains, drive economic growth. By contrast, the unemployment rate depends on employment but also on the labor force participation rate. Either rising employment or falling labor force participation can drive the unemployment rate lower, but only the former would contribute to economic growth. Fannie Mae foresees higher employment growth in 2024 than in earlier forecasts. Q1 2024 is predicted to have the strongest employment growth with an average monthly gain of 276,000 jobs. Q3 2024 is predicted to have the largest employment growth gain from that called for in last month’s forecast with an upward revision of 54,000 monthly job gains to an average of 153,000 new jobs per month. Compared to last month’s forecast, the expected full year forecast for employment growth in 2024 was revised from a gain of 1,600,000 jobs to a gain of 2,100,000 jobs. The employment growth forecast for 2025 was lowered from gain of 900,000 jobs to a gain of 800,000 jobs. The Fannie Mae April forecast can be found here.

Fed’s ‘higher for longer’ gambit may yet cool home price gains - Inman,Fed’s ‘higher for longer’ gambit may yet cool home price gains  Inman,"Wed, 24 Apr 2024 21:54:33 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlubWFuLmNvbS8_cD0xMDI1ODI40gFhaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5tYW4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjQvZmVkcy1oaWdoZXItZm9yLWxvbmdlci1nYW1iaXQtbWF5LXlldC1jb29sLWhvbWUtcHJpY2UtZ2FpbnMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Inman,"At Inman Connect Las Vegas, July 30-Aug. 1 2024, the noise and misinformation will be banished, all your big questions will be answered, and new business opportunities will be revealed. Join us. Home prices are showing surprising strength in the face of the Fed’s “higher for longer” interest rate strategy, but home price appreciation is expected to cool this year and next even as mortgage rates come down, according to two closely watched forecasts. Economists at Fannie Mae and the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) are now in agreement that mortgage rates will come down only gradually this year and next as Federal Reserve policymakers wait for more evidence that they’re winning their war on inflation. In a March 21 forecast, MBA economists had predicted rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages would drop to 6.1 percent by the end of this year, and average 5.6 percent in Q4 2024. The latest MBA forecast, issued April 18, envisions rates at 6.4 percent by Q4 2024 and 5.9 percent during Q4 2025. In a forecast released Tuesday, Fannie Mae economists said they see rates on 30-year fixed-rate loans dropping to 6.4 percent by the end of this year and to 6 percent during the second half of next year. Mortgage rates expected to fall gradually Fannie Mae economists are slightly more optimistic about the pace of 2025 rate declines than they were in March when they didn’t expect rates to hit 6 percent until Q4. “While we still expect economic growth and inflation to moderate going forward — and, thus, for mortgage rates to drift downward — interest rates existing in a ‘higher for longer’ state seems to be an increasingly real possibility in the eyes of market participants, as well as some homebuyers and sellers,” Fannie Mae Vice President Hamilton Fout said in a statement. But Fannie Mae forecasters also note that their mortgage rate projections were put together earlier this month. Since then, rates have climbed on hot consumer price index (CPI) and labor reports. The Fed’s continued struggles to tame inflation mean there’s “upside risk” to Fannie Mae’s baseline mortgage rate forecast, economists at the mortgage giant said in commentary accompanying their latest forecast. In other words, rates could stay higher than projected. Financial markets no longer expect that the Federal Reserve will start cutting short-term interest rates in June, and the prospects for three 2024 rate cuts as projected by Fed policymakers in December and March are also in doubt. “We now expect just two 25-basis point rate cuts to the fed funds rate this year, with the first occurring in September,” Fannie Mae economists said. “Of course, there remains the possibility that there will be no rate cuts in 2024, but that is not our base case forecast.” Analysts at UBS Group AG also expect the Fed to cut rates twice this year, but see an outside chance that instead of cutting rates, the Fed might have to raise them next year — a move that might send mortgage rates soaring above 8 percent, they warned. Home price appreciation projected to cool While elevated mortgage rates have dented home sales, national home prices have continued to rise, in part, because many existing homeowners are feeling locked in to the low rate on their existing mortgage and have been reluctant to sell. The lack of inventory in many markets has made homebuyers more willing to pay higher asking prices. The double-digit home price appreciation seen during the pandemic cooled in 2022 and the first half of 2023, only to rebound in the second half of the year as inventories remained scarce. Economists expect home prices will continue to rise, but that the pace of home price appreciation will slow as more listings come on the market. “Despite continued high mortgage rates, an increasing share of homeowners appear to be acclimating to the higher mortgage rate environment or deciding they can no longer put off the listing of their homes,” Fannie Mae economists said. New listings are expected to come onto the market faster than sales pick up, “which should help gradually thaw housing inventory and contribute to decelerating home price growth.” Fannie Mae economists believe home price appreciation is poised to decelerate from 7.4 percent during Q1 2024 to 4.8 percent by the end of this year and to 1.5 percent by Q4 2025. When forecasters at the mortgage giant last updated their home price appreciation forecast in January, they were expecting home prices to decelerate more drastically — to 3.2 percent by the end of 2024 and to just 0.3 percent in Q4 2025. MBA economists concur that home price appreciation will cool this year, but remain above 3 percent in 2025. ‘Modest’ growth in 2024 home sales expected Fannie Mae economists expect growth in new listings will help generate a “modest” 4.3 percent increase in 2024 sales of existing homes, to 4.266 million, followed by a more significant 10 percent bump in 2025 sales to 4.691 million. Economists at the mortgage giant are projecting similar growth in new home sales, which are forecast to rise by 4 percent in 2024 to 693,000 homes and by 12.8 percent in 2025 to 782,000 homes. Rising home sales, prices could boost mortgage lending With home sales and home prices both expected to rise, Fannie Mae expects 2024 mortgage originations to grow by 23 percent, to $1.818 trillion, followed by 25 percent growth in 2025, to $2.261 trillion. “We have revised upward our expectation for both purchase and refinance mortgage origination volumes this month, due in particular to our more optimistic home price growth expectation and somewhat lower mortgage rate path, along with an upgraded expectation for home sales,” Fannie Mae economists said. Mortgage refinancing volume is forecast to grow by 67 percent this year to $415 billion and 58 percent in 2025 to $657 billion. But mortgage lenders will still be counting on homebuyers for most of their business, with purchase loan originations expected to climb by 23 percent this year to $1.398 trillion and by 25 percent in 2025 to $1.604 trillion. “It should be noted, however, that given the upside risk to mortgage rates in our forecast, we see downside risk to our originations outlook,” Fannie Mae economists said.

Studying commercial to residential conversions - Yield PRO magazine,Studying commercial to residential conversions  Yield PRO magazine,"Thu, 25 Apr 2024 16:10:22 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8veWllbGRwcm8uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvc3R1ZHlpbmctY29tbWVyY2lhbC10by1yZXNpZGVudGlhbC1jb252ZXJzaW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yield PRO magazine,"The Multifamily Economic and Market Commentary for April from Fannie Mae focused on the conversion of commercial property to residential uses. It looked at different approaches and discussed the factors that may dictate the role conversions play in providing new housing over the next few years. Setting the background The increase in the number of people working from home since the pandemic has led to many cities having significant volumes of underutilized office space and, to a lesser extent, underutilized hotel and retail space. The shortage of available housing in many markets has focused attention on converting this commercial space to housing. In its monthly commentary, Fannie Mae gathered information on prior studies of these conversions to highlight factors that lead to successful outcomes. Fannie Mae looked both at conversions through adaptive reuse, where the existing building is modified to support housing, and through redevelopment, where the existing building is torn down to make way for new housing construction. A key to success is the housing developer acquiring the commercial property to be converted at a low price. Another key is that there is sufficient demand for multifamily housing in the target market to absorb the multifamily housing currently under development along with the proposed project. Looking at the challenges The commentary notes that adaptive reuse conversions of hotels to single-room occupancy (SRO) housing have been done economically. However, it also notes that hotels are expected to perform well in 2024 and therefore may not be a good source of convertible properties. Retail space utilization is in flux because of competition from e-commerce. However, operating models where local retail space is used in a complementary fashion with e-commerce are evolving, so retail may not be a major source of convertible properties going forward. Surplus office space may be available, but may it require major renovations to adapt it for housing. The report notes that the requirements for gas, water, power and sewer are much higher for residential space than for office space, so the buildings may require costly upgrades. It also notes that code requirements for natural lighting and ventilation of residential spaces limits the plat size of a building which is a good candidate for conversion. Many newer office buildings have larger than optimal plat sizes so they are not good candidates. Fannie Mae suggests that waivers of code requirements may be required to make conversions of existing buildings viable. Examples of waivers cited were allowing residential lofts or SRO’s to be built, or not requiring full upgrades of buildings to current earthquake standards. Second order effects The commentary notes that the changing nature of the neighborhoods where disused office buildings are candidates for conversion itself presents a challenge. The bars and restaurants which were supported by the workers who are no longer coming to work in the buildings may fail, making the neighborhood less attractive to potential residents. At the same time, businesses desired by the new potential residents, like grocery stores and childcare, may not exist until a critical mass of residents exists. These neighborhood changes present risk for the developer or investor considering a residential conversion. The commentary states that commercial conversions are expected to provide about 4 percent of new housing over the next few years. It points to a study indicating that large scale conversion of commercial property to residential uses will not occur unless there are large declines in the prices for commercial buildings, which hasn’t happened yet. It also suggests that the majority of repurposing of commercial real estate will take place through redevelopment rather than through adaptive reuse in the years ahead. The full commentary can be found here.",https://yieldpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AdaptiveReuse.jpg,2024-04-25,0.173,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SRO', 'latitude': 53.32500076293945, 'longitude': -1.1679999828338623, 'location_type': 'POI'}]","Fannie Mae's April commentary highlights the potential for converting commercial properties to residential housing. Adaptive reuse and redevelopment approaches are discussed, with factors such as acquisition cost and market demand being crucial for success. Challenges include high renovation costs for office space and neighborhood changes. Fannie Mae estimates commercial conversions will contribute about 4% of new housing in the coming years, primarily through redevelopment rather than adaptive reuse."

Even as rising mortgage rates cooled the pace of home sales and refinances starting in 2022, appraisal modernization efforts picked up steam. In 2023, Fannie Mae updated its Selling Guide to include more options for valuations, including value acceptance (formerly appraisal waivers), value acceptance plus property data and hybrid appraisals. Today, lenders are relying on technology more than ever before to deliver accurate, timely valuations. Another area of continued focus is appraisal bias. In 2022, the Biden administration formed the PAVE task force, made up of 13 federal agencies and offices, to combat appraisal bias. Led by HUD, the task force created an action plan the agencies could pursue through administrative action, rather than legislation, and released analysis of its appraisal data.

These highlights share the CFPB’s findings from supervisory examinations completed between April 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023. Although only a portion of the Supervisory Highlights addresses fees, as discussed below, the CFPB’s Newsroom article is titled “CFPB Takes Action to Stop Illegal Junk Fees in Mortgage Servicing,” once again emphasizing the bureau’s laser focus on “exploitative illegal fees,” that it has coined “junk fees.” The Supervisory Highlight’s Introduction notes that the CFPB has been actively monitoring the mortgage “market for emerging risks during a period of increasing default servicing activity since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency.” The bureau remains concerned about the rise in loss mitigation requests, changes in federal programs and policies, and staffing during the last few challenging years. While recognizing that “mortgage delinquencies and foreclosure rates remain near all-time lows,” the CFPB anticipates that the future will bring difficult changes as consumers have higher levels of debt and face affordability concerns. The issues addressed in this recent edition of Supervisory Highlights include: Unfair charges for property inspections prohibited by Fannie Mae guidelines: CFPB examiners found that some servicers improperly charged property inspection fees on Fannie Mae loans, in contravention of the Fannie Mae Servicing Guidelines. Specifically, the examiners found that, in some instances, servicers would charge a property inspection fee even though the property was borrower or tenant occupied and quality right party contact (QRPC) had been established within 30 days, the borrower had made a full payment within the last 30 days, or the borrower was performing under a loss mitigation option. These improper inspection fees numbered in the “hundreds.” In response to the findings, the servicers corrected identified automation flaws behind some of the fees and implemented testing and monitoring to address others. Borrower remediation was also required. We note that the CFPB deemed these improper fees to not only be violations of the Fannie Mae Servicing Guidelines but to also be violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act’s prohibition on unfair acts or practices. Unfair late fee overcharges: Several servicers were found to have engaged in unfair acts or practices by assessing unauthorized late fees. These errors occurred when (1) servicers charged late fees that exceeded the amount in the loan agreement, and/or (2) servicers charged late fees even though consumers had entered into loss mitigation agreements that should have prevented the fees. In response to the findings, refunds were provided and internal processes were improved. Failing to waive existing fees following acceptance of COVID-19 loan modifications: Examiners found that some servicers offered streamlined COVID-19 loan modifications under Regulation X but that they failed to waive fees on the account after borrowers accepted the modifications. These failures violated the regulation’s fee waiver requirement for offering streamlined modifications. The CFPB noted that remediation was being provided to those affected consumers. Failing to provide adequate description of fees in periodic statements: The Supervisory Highlights identified servicer failures to provide a “brief description of certain fees and charges” on periodic statements and, instead, used the generic term “service fee” without any other descriptive information. This practice violated Regulation Z’s requirement that billing statements include transaction history with “brief description of the transaction.” In response to the finding, the servicers implemented changes to provide more specific descriptions of each service fee. Failing to make timely disbursements from escrow accounts: Servicers were cited for failure to make timely disbursements from consumer escrow accounts in compliance with Regulation X. Specifically, the servicers attempted to make disbursements in a timely manner, but the payments did not reach the recipients. To compound the error, the servicers then delayed for months in reissuing the payments. As a result, borrowers incurred penalties due to the late payments. These unsuccessful and late payments were not timely and, therefore, violated Regulation X. Remediation was later provided to the affected consumers. Deceptive loss mitigation eligibility notices: The CFPB examiners identified instances where servicers were advising borrowers that they were approved for streamlined loss mitigation options even though no such determination had been made. In some instances, the consumers were actually denied for the streamlined option. The bureau deemed these notices to be misleading and material to consumers. Deceptive delinquency notices: TheSupervisory Highlights identified servicer errors in sending notices to advise borrowers that they had missed payments and should fill out loss mitigation applications when, in fact, those consumers were current on their payments, in trial modification plans, or had inactive loans. These errors were deemed to be deceptive by the CFPB, and the affected servicers are implementing policies and procedures to ensure accuracy of their notices. Loss mitigation violations: CFPB examiners found that some servicers violated Regulation X by sending loss mitigation application acknowledgment notices to borrowers that did not specify whether the applications were complete or incomplete. One servicer was cited for its failure to include a deadline for acceptance or rejection in its loss mitigation offers. And multiple servicers were also found to have violated Regulation X because they did not provide timely notices to borrowers stating their determination regarding the available loss mitigation options. Further, the bureau found that servicers violated Regulation X by failing to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to properly evaluate borrower applications for all available loss mitigation options. In response to this variety of errors, servicers promised to update their policies and procedures, refund or waive late charges, and to correct negative credit reporting where necessary. Live contact and early intervention violations: CFPB examiners found that servicers “failed to make good faith efforts to establish live contact with hundreds of delinquent borrowers.” Further, some servicers failed to send early intervention notices to “thousands of delinquent borrowers,” as required by Regulation X. In response to the findings, the servicers agreed to waive or refund late fees. Failing to retain records documenting actions taken on mortgage loan accounts: Servicers were cited for failing to document actions in their servicing systems, such as establishing live contact with borrowers, in violation of Regulation X. We see two key takeaways from this latest edition of Supervisory Highlights. First, the overarching theme is that servicers still struggle with the complexities of loss mitigation engagement with borrowers and that the CFPB will scrutinize the smallest details of loss mitigation correspondence and handling. And second, the CFPB continues to focus on any and all fees imposed on consumers and any erroneously charged fee will be called a “junk fee.” Listen to this post",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/2024-04/House%20Model%20Real%20Estate%20Mortgage%20Rent%20Property%20Home%20Keys.jpg,2024-04-25,-0.498,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]","The CFPB found that some servicers improperly charged property inspection fees on Fannie Mae loans, in contravention of the Fannie Mae Servicing Guidelines.

She is also the co-founder of WaterfallCalc, an online loss mitigation decision and calculation tool that enables servicers to streamline loss mitigation calculations while ensuring investor and regulatory compliance. In today’s complex mortgage servicing landscape, the ultimate goal is not just to protect investors, but also to facilitate the best possible outcomes for borrowers. Fannie Mae’s recent training on this very topic underscores a vital aspect of this process–guiding delinquent borrowers through their options as effectively and gracefully as possible. Fannie Mae’s initiative couldn’t be timelier. Over the past three years, streamlined approaches to home retention have enabled millions of distressed homeowners to keep their homes. Yet for many, they failed to address the root causes of financial distress. The primary reason borrowers default is because they have excessive obligations. It’s no secret that wages have failed to keep pace with inflation, or that many Americans are leaning on credit simply to make ends meet. And while streamlined loss mitigation options have provided temporary relief, for some, it hasn’t been enough. In fact, in many cases, it’s created revolving door of assistance that can erode a borrower’s equity. Unfortunately, the assistance spigot gets turned off at some point, and borrowers must confront the reality that they can no longer afford their home or current lifestyle, and “budget reckoning” takes place. When this happens, it’s up to servicers to analyze each borrower’s situation carefully and holistically before determining which path is the most realistic. For borrowers who have already exhausted other avenues, a short sale often emerges as the most practical option. In most cases, a short sale allows borrowers to exit their mortgage obligations with dignity, avoid the stigma and long-term impacts of foreclosure and embark on a swifter path back to financial stability. It’s crucial that servicers do not look at Fannie Mae’s guidelines as an operational hurdle, but as an opportunity to support the financial recovery of families who have found themselves swimming helplessly against financial tides. By providing the necessary support and interventions, we can truly make a difference in the lives of distressed borrowers, guiding them towards a more sustainable future.

CFPB shares update on combating mortgage servicer 'junk fees' - Scotsman Guide News,CFPB shares update on combating mortgage servicer 'junk fees'  Scotsman Guide News,"Thu, 25 Apr 2024 01:07:30 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjb3RzbWFuZ3VpZGUuY29tL25ld3MvY2ZwYi1zaGFyZXMtdXBkYXRlLW9uLWNvbWJhdGluZy1tb3J0Z2FnZS1zZXJ2aWNpbmctanVuay1mZWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Scotsman Guide News,"A new report published by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) shared some of the agency’s recent findings on the mortgage servicing market, including some revelations from its ongoing scrutiny of “junk fees” charged by banks and other lenders. Per its “Supervisory Highlights, Mortgage Servicing Edition” report, the CFPB noted that its examiners continue to find mortgage servicers assessing what it called “exploitative illegal fees,” including improper late fees and unnecessary property inspection fees. Mortgage investors usually mandate a property inspection for accounts that have been delinquent for a set amount of time, with the costs of those visits then generally passed on to consumers. Not every loan is eligible for such inspections, however; Fannie Mae guidelines, for example, prohibit such inspections on mortgages if the property is owner- or tenant-occupied and the borrower is under a loss mitigation or bankruptcy plan. Fannie guidelines outline similar inspection prohibitions for loans under other specific conditions as well, but CFPB examiners found that servicers still charged property inspection fees on many such Fannie Mae loans. “Hundreds of borrowers” were charged property inspection fees barred by Fannie Mae, the CFPB found, causing consumers “substantial injury.” A number of other borrowers were levied late fees that either exceeded the amount allowed in the loan agreement or shouldn’t have been charged because the borrower had entered into a loss mitigation program. CFPB reviews also found other unfair or deceptive practices, including deceptive loss mitigation or delinquency notices, failures to make timely escrow account disbursements, inadequate descriptions of fees, and failures to waive fees following borrowers accepting loan modifications related to COVID-19. Servicers also violated several other loss mitigation provisions within Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Findings in the report cover examinations completed by the CFPB from April through December of last year. In all of the above instances, the CFPB directed servicers to improve internal processes, as well as identify and remediate borrowers who were impacted, including refunding any borrowers who were charged improper fees. The report also states that the CFPB is currently reviewing Regulation X’s current framework to pinpoint possible ways to streamline mortgage servicing rules. “Homeowners cannot just simply switch providers if their mortgage servicer charges them illegal junk fees,” said Rohit Chopra, director of the CFPB. “Since mortgage borrowers are captive to a company they never chose to do business with, we are working hard to detect and deter violations of law.”",https://www.scotsmanguide.com/files/sites/2/2022/04/c579b42e_shutterstock_1658231284.jpg,2024-04-24,-0.603,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bureau', 'latitude': 41.28919982910156, 'longitude': -89.3664779663086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]","The CFPB found that mortgage servicers charged property inspection fees on Fannie Mae loans that were prohibited by Fannie Mae guidelines, causing ""substantial injury"" to hundreds of borrowers."
CFPB Supervisory Highlights Reflect Continued Emphasis on “Junk Fees” - JD Supra,CFPB Supervisory Highlights Reflect Continued Emphasis on “Junk Fees”  JD Supra,"Fri, 26 Apr 2024 15:41:53 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpkc3VwcmEuY29tL2xlZ2FsbmV3cy9jZnBiLXN1cGVydmlzb3J5LWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtcmVmbGVjdC0zMjkzNTM5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,JD Supra,"On April 24, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released the latest edition of its Supervisory Highlights, this time targeting so-called “junk fees” in the mortgage servicing industry. According to the CFPB, its examiners found that mortgage servicers continued to assess junk fees in a wide array of activities, including unnecessary property inspection fees and improper late fees. The highlighted observations reflect that boarding errors and compliance failures that involve the assessment of fees will be categorized as “junk fees” by the Bureau as it and other regulatory agencies address the assessment of fees and product pricing for financial products and services. “Unfair” Property Inspection Fees The CFPB first highlighted unfair acts or practices committed by loan servicers for charging property inspection fees prohibited by investor guidelines. According to the Bureau, Fannie Mae guidelines prohibit property inspections if the property is occupied by a borrower or tenant and one of the following applies: the servicer established right party contact with the borrower in the last 30 days; the borrower made a full payment within the last 30 days; or the borrower is performing under a loss mitigation option or bankruptcy plan. According to the CFPB, its examiners found that servicers charged borrowers for property inspection fees on hundreds of occasions, notwithstanding the fact that one of the exclusions above applied to each of the borrowers charged. The CFPB found that this constituted a violation of the CFPA because “[c]onsumers were unable to anticipate the property inspection fees or mitigate them because they have no influence over the servicer’s practices.” In response, the servicers corrected automated flaws in their servicing platforms, implemented new training and monitoring to avoid these inspection fees in the future and, where appropriate, reimbursed borrowers charged these fees. Despite consumers not being party to investor contracts and limitations on servicing fees varying by investor, servicers should take note that an operational or compliance error resulting in failure to adhere to GSE or investor servicing guidelines may result in claims under the Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices Act (UDAAP) (including, potentially, under the FDCPA) and allegations regarding the assessment of “junk fees”. “Unauthorized” Late Fees The Bureau’s examiners also uncovered instances of servicers engaging in unfair acts or practices by assessing “unauthorized” late fees. The unauthorized late fees arose in two circumstances: when the servicer charged a late fee that exceeded the amount permitted in the loan documents; and when the servicer charged a late fee even though the consumer had entered into a loss mitigation agreement that should have precluded such fees. In response to these findings, servicers reimbursed the impacted borrowers. Here we note that in the Bureau’s view, the assessment of late charges resulting from boarding errors or compliance errors can result in “junk fee” allegations. Improper Fees Related to COVID-19 Loss Mitigation Finally, examiners reported numerous instances of loan servicers charging borrowers for certain fees that should have been waived following acceptance of COVID-19 loss mitigation plans. Reg. X, 12 C.F.R. § 1024 et. seq., authorizes loan servicers to offer borrowers streamlined loan modifications to those who experienced a COVID-19 hardship. Reg. X further mandates that servicers “waive all existing late charges, penalties, stop payment fees, or similar charges that were incurred on or after March 1, 2020, promptly upon the borrower’s acceptance of the loan modification.” The CFPB’s examination found a number of servicers were not, in fact, waiving these existing fees in violation of Regulation X. In response, loan servicers are remediating consumers. This Supervisory Highlight demonstrates enhanced scrutiny by the Bureau of servicer compliance requirements when fees and charges assessed to consumers are involved. In addition, it reflects that the Bureau will categorize the failure to adhere to investor guidelines, boarding errors or general operational errors resulting in the assessment of servicing fees as the assessment of “junk fees,” as the Bureau, along with other federal agencies, scrutinize the assessment of fees and charges in financial products and services, as well as pricing practices in general.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16024_4443.jpg,2024-04-24,-0.722,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bureau', 'latitude': 41.28919982910156, 'longitude': -89.3664779663086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reg', 'latitude': 29.0150203704834, 'longitude': 67.48046112060547, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'C.F.R.', 'latitude': 50.98305892944336, 'longitude': -1.3844399452209473, 'location_type': 'POI'}]","The CFPB found that mortgage servicers charged borrowers for property inspection fees on hundreds of occasions, notwithstanding the fact that Fannie Mae guidelines prohibit property inspections if the property is occupied by a borrower or tenant and one of the following applies: the servicer established right party contact with the borrower in the last 30 days; the borrower made a full payment within the last 30 days; or the borrower is performing under a loss mitigation option or bankruptcy plan."

CFPB also has a threshold under which it doesn’t have jurisdiction over servicing.” Consumers can lose protections as a result of this, he explained. “So, all loans repurchased and placed into a ‘scratch and dent’ pool — essentially loans sitting on someone’s private balance sheet — those consumers don’t have any of those protections,” he said. “Whether you agree with the announcement or not, this is clear evidence that repurchases are generally bad for consumers.” Stork mentioned the Freddie Mac pilot program for repurchases in which lenders “essentially insure themselves against a repurchase,” saying that analysis of the math asserts that “the lender’s goal with that pilot program is to protect themselves from repurchase risk. Essentially, all risks can be calculated, quantified and translated into dollars. This pilot helps mitigate the risk of repurchase, he said. For smaller lenders that pose less risk statistically, there’s no major repurchase obligation, meaning onerous conditions are not imposed on them. “That’s why we’re super excited about this pilot,” he said. Touching on the topic of credit reporting, Stork said that agencies and regulatory bodies, in addition to the three major credit bureaus, are interested in credit report structures. After a notable increase to FICO credit score pricing, it became clear that a lot of industry participants don’t truly understand what the pricing involves. The scores themselves, data from the reporting bureaus, fees for reissuance, updates and combination with a scoring algorithm all play into the pricing structure, Stork said. “I think there’s a very huge difference in the value of data that is known data that we’re buying and then calculating the formula on, versus a custom-built analysis of the value of a property, which includes actually physically visiting the property,” he said. “I struggle with the idea that the data which we can push a button on our computers and grab — I know it’s more complicated than that — but sometimes it’s not the same value to a consumer as making sure that the house they’re buying is really what it’s supposed to be for.” Other topics Stork touched on with HousingWire Managing Editor James Kleimann during the session included increased fee transparency for the consumer.

The price index for GDP purchases increased to 3.1% in the initial quarter of 2024, marking a significant increase from 1.9% in the preceding quarter of 2023. Similarly, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index surged by 3.4% in Q1, up from a 1.8% rise in Q4. Excluding food and energy costs, the core PCE price index saw an even steeper rise in Q1, reaching 3.7% compared to the 2% level of Q4. These figures surpass economists' expectations and exceed the Federal Reserve's target of 2%.

The liberal media, of course, is trying to spin the report in the best possible light and to assuage concerns about a recession. But another top economist says that the signs are indeed pointing to one. Related: GDP Growth Slows in First Quarter While Inflation Remains High. Can You Say 'Stagflation'? According to Nancy Lazar, an economist at Piper Sandler, the U.S. economy is currently facing a unique challenge that she described as a ""bifurcated"" economy, which has only happened twice before and has led to recessions both times: the energy crisis of 1978-1979 and the Great Recession of 2008. Lazar explained that while large businesses benefit from higher interest rates, favorable financial conditions, and government support, consumers are struggling with mounting debts and inflation eroding wage gains. She predicts a 53% chance of a recession. One concern the media is conceding is that the report signals that stagflation may be coming. “For those who do not understand what just happened, we have a weakening economy with rising inflation: The worst possible outcome for the Fed,” the Kobeissi Letter wrote on social media X.Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, emphasizes that any hope pinned on the recent US GDP data to alleviate pressure on US government bond yields will be completely disappointed due to another significant inflation reading.This dual challenge of sluggish growth coupled with elevated inflation “is problematic for the economy and markets, with political and social spillovers,” the economist added.Echoing this message, macroeconomist Craig Shapiro remarked “Weaker than expected GDP and Personal Consumption but higher than expected Core PCE Index and better labor data. That’s a stagflationary mess for folks begging for the Fed put to be activated.”“This report was the worst of both worlds: economic growth is slowing and inflationary pressures are persisting,” claimed Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. Biden, naturally, thinks the report is good news. ""Today’s report shows the American economy remains strong, with continued steady and stable growth,"" he claimed in a statement. ""The economy has grown more since I took office than at this point in any presidential term in the last 25 years—including 3% growth over the last year—while unemployment has stayed below 4% for more than two years.""",https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/297/d586837f-8158-4b07-9a92-72f8ea89a9f9.jpg,2024-04-25,-0.083,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Spencer Brown', 'description': 'Australian rugby union player, born 1921', 'full_name': 'Spencer Brown'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Piper Sandler', 'description': 'American financial services company', 'full_name': 'Piper Sandler Companies', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/US_Bancorp_Center_Minneapolis_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Craig Shapiro', 'description': 'American film director', 'full_name': 'Craig Shapiro'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'GDP', 'latitude': 51.582000732421875, 'longitude': 0.20630000531673431, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Biden', 'latitude': 5.229050159454346, 'longitude': -1.0081199407577515, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'VIX', 'latitude': 47.90599822998047, 'longitude': 4.539999961853027, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DOW', 'latitude': 39.01337814331055, 'longitude': -90.34149932861328, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'POINTS', 'latitude': 39.439998626708984, 'longitude': -78.61028289794922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Lazar', 'latitude': 42.866668701171875, 'longitude': 23.399999618530273, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Erian', 'latitude': 10.009699821472168, 'longitude': 47.48210144042969, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Allianz', 'latitude': 48.154441833496094, 'longitude': 11.588890075683594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Core', 'latitude': 7.216670036315918, 'longitude': 38.91667175292969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not-related content.
