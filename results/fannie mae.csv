The study, which has yet to undergo peer review but has been published online, indicates that most of these insurers are financially weak, falling short of federal guidelines required to back mortgaged homes. This raises concerns about the accuracy of ratings that may lead consumers to perceive these insurers as healthier than they are. The focus on Florida’s insurance market reveals a huge reliance on about 50 small insurers, covering 70% of policyholders, often rated by a single entity, Demotech Inc. The study underscores the consequences of relying on a single rating agency, especially after a public dispute in 2022 involving Demotech’s threat to downgrade 17 companies. The potential downgrade could have impacted the state’s housing market and led to challenges for policyholders. Comparing Demotech’s ratings to those of AM Best, a more established ratings company, the study found discrepancies. While Demotech’s “A” rating equates to AM Best’s “B” or “B+”, the study suggests that many of Demotech’s A-rated insurers would not meet the eligibility criteria of mortgage giants like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if rated by AM Best. These findings raise concerns about the reliability of rating agencies and the potential for rating shopping among lower-quality insurers. The study highlights the need for greater scrutiny and independent evaluations of insurers’ financial health, especially in disaster-prone areas like Florida. Despite the risks associated with small insurers, the study notes that Florida regulators have been relatively lax in their oversight. Recommendations from the survey include requiring insurers to be rated by multiple agencies and implementing programs to incentivize insurers to improve their ratings over time. While some lawmakers and regulators have acknowledged these risks, concrete actions based on the study’s recommendations have yet to materialize. The study’s findings underscore the ongoing challenges in Florida’s insurance market and the importance of robust regulatory measures to protect consumers and ensure the market’s stability.",https://www.theartistree.fm/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Harvard-University.jpg,2024-04-17,0.049,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'AM Best', 'description': 'company', 'full_name': 'A.

Three REITs with new downgrades this week - THE BHARAT EXPRESS NEWS - The Bharat Express News,Three REITs with new downgrades this week - THE BHARAT EXPRESS NEWS  The Bharat Express News,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 20:33:22 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmhhcmF0ZXhwcmVzc25ld3MuY29tL3RocmVlLXJlaXRzLXdpdGgtbmV3LWRvd25ncmFkZXMtdGhpcy13ZWVrL9IBS2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmhhcmF0ZXhwcmVzc25ld3MuY29tL3RocmVlLXJlaXRzLXdpdGgtbmV3LWRvd25ncmFkZXMtdGhpcy13ZWVrLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Bharat Express News,"It’s hard for investors when analysts downgrade their stocks. But there are many reasons for an analyst downgrade. Sometimes a stock has risen so much that the analyst believes it is no longer a good value relative to its price. At other times, competition, a perceived downturn in the general economy, or the resignation of a longtime insider who has known a company may lead the analyst to believe that a company is unlikely to perform well in the coming months. Whatever the reason, the usual result of a downgrade is a decline in the stock price. But the decline could be temporary as the company develops new businesses, economic forecasts improve or new leadership proves its worth. Take a look at three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that just received downgrades from analysts and some of the concerns that justified these decisions. TPG RE Finance Trust Inc. (NYSE:TRTX), a subsidiary of TPG Real Estate, is a mortgage REIT with a portfolio of $4.2 billion of first mortgage loans with an average loan size of $71.6 million, in geographically diversified primary and select secondary markets in the U.S. . On February 20, TPG RE Finance Trust reported its fourth quarter operating results. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.05 was above the estimate of $0.17. Revenue of $31.49 million was higher than estimates of $24.73 million, but lower than fourth-quarter 2022 revenue of $35.99 million. Do not miss it: Despite the less than favorable earnings report, earnings expectations were positive and investors continued to support the stock. Year-to-date, TPG RE Finance has achieved a total return of 16.33%. On April 12, Raymond James analyst Stephen Laws downgraded TPG RE Finance Trust from Strong Buy to Outperform, while keeping the price target at $8.50. This is still above the consensus one-year average price target of $7.90. Arbor Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:ABR) is a Long Island-based mortgage REIT (mREIT) that originates bridge and mezzanine loans for commercial and residential real estate. Many of the loans come from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. Arbor Realty Trust generates profits from the spread between the financing costs of the loan and the interest earned on that loan. Many of Arbor Realty Trust’s commercial loans are short-term first mortgage loans with higher interest rates. Arbor Realty’s mid-February quarterly report was somewhat mixed. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.51 beat the consensus estimate of $0.44 per share, but were 15% lower than fourth quarter 2022 earnings per share of $0.60. Revenue of $103.58 million also surpassed the consensus estimate of $97.65 million, but fell from $113.06 million in the fourth quarter. 2022. The story continues On April 11, Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless downgraded Arbor Realty Trust from Outperform to Neutral and lowered the price target 23.5% from $17 to $13. McCanless is concerned about the longer interest rates and the resulting risks Arbor Realty will face due to increased delinquencies and non-performing loans. He also sees opportunities for a lower loan volume. The analyst lowered the 2024 EPS estimate from $1.95 to $1.80. Popular Clipper Real Estate Inc. (NYSE:CLPR) is a small, New York-based, self-managed and self-managed REIT that owns, manages, operates and repositions multifamily residential and commercial properties in the New York City area. It was founded in 2017. On March 14, Clipper Realty reported fourth-quarter 2023 operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.15 per share beat the $0.13 per share estimate and represented a 36.36% increase over FFO of $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue of $34.87 million was below the consensus estimate of $37.28 million, but slightly above revenue of $0.15 per share. $33.01 million in Q4 2022. On April 11, JMP Securities analyst Aaron Hecht downgraded Clipper Realty from Market Outperform to Market Perform. Hecht noted Clipper’s recent announcement as part of its fourth-quarter earnings report that it will lose its tenant at the 12-story 250 Livingston Street in Brooklyn at the end of its lease in August 2025. The tenant is the City of New York , and the annual rental price is 15.4 million dollars. While that gives Clipper plenty of time to re-lease the space, the analyst also noted that the tenant in this 294,144-square-foot commercial and residential building accounts for approximately 15% of Clipper’s net operating income. This creates what Hecht called “tenant uncertainty,” and Hecht believes Clipper Realty is now fairly valued.

From Forms to Reports: A Look at the UAD Overhaul - Appraisal Buzz,From Forms to Reports: A Look at the UAD Overhaul  Appraisal Buzz,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 10:02:50 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYXBwcmFpc2FsYnV6ei5jb20vZnJvbS1mb3Jtcy10by1yZXBvcnRzLWEtbG9vay1hdC10aGUtdWFkLW92ZXJoYXVsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Appraisal Buzz,"By now, most appraisers are aware that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) have embarked on a complete overhaul of the Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD). UAD originated in 2010 and since then we appraisers are accustomed to using codes like “C4,” “N;Res,” and “1200sf0sfin” in our mortgage appraisal reports to communicate the results of our analysis. These codes, or language, make sense to appraisers but confuse uninitiated readers of our reports. To bridge this barrier, appraisers include addenda in their reports that translate these codes into human interpretable language. It seems it would be better just using descriptive terms that our intended users could understand rather than needing to translate. How did we get here? It all starts with the standard appraisal forms used in the mortgage process. There are 12 principal forms used for a mortgage origination appraisal. These forms have been around since the early 1980s with a few revisions over the years. The original forms were designed before the digital age, to be completed on typewriters. These forms became fixed in the mortgage industry and have remained the standard for decades. Appraisal software companies have innovated the process of “filling out “these forms, but they are still constrained with the original typewriter design. The UAD “codes” that we use as appraisers are a result of restrictive nature of the “forms,” there is only so much space available on the forms. As a result, saying that a site location is residential in nature, and neutral in terms of surrounding influences becomes “N;Res;” to fit in the legacy form field. It has been four decades since the forms originated, and nobody uses typewriters anymore. All our forms are generated by software packages that transmit our reports via Extensible Markup Language (XML). But we are still stuck with the “form” functionality. The abbreviations we use in our forms are in fact, data points for the GSEs. Using the form structure, GSEs have been ingesting these eclectic abbreviations to develop a large database of residential valuation. If typewriters are no more, it is time for forms to be retired as well. Really, appraisers have always thought this way. We produce appraisal “reports” not appraisal “forms.” That is the perspective that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are taking with the new version of UAD. No longer will there be forms; there will only be a “report.” The new data set is all encompassing for every property type (residential) that were traditionally divided into 12 separate forms. The appraiser will be led through a process, defined by the scope of work. This scope of work is determined by the type of property and the characteristics of the property. Appraisers will be presented with the data elements needed to report the characteristics of the subject property, and analyze the market, comparables, and other necessary parts of the appraisal process. Only those data and report elements that are important for the scope of work will be presented to the appraiser. Data will be emphasized and made more discrete. The intention is to make the appraisal more objective and less reliant on subjective language and commentary. Data fields that were once abbreviated will be displayed in human understandable text. There may be more data points, but there will be less narration necessary by the appraiser. Appraiser can focus on analysis and less on commentary. Objective data and appropriate analysis of that data will reduce the overall liability for the Appraiser. The output will be a report, just as Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) requires. USPAP only addresses “forms “beyond the Standards required of appraisers. When USPAP speaks to forms, it is usually in the context of problems that arise from the use of forms. In terms of compliance, the new process-based approach may be advantageous for appraisers, reducing subjective language and reinforcing compliance with commentary as necessary. Again, Scope of Work, required by USPAP, is central to this new methodology. This all sounds great, but the road of innovation ahead will have some curves that need to be negotiated. There are many stakeholders in the mortgage process that these changes will impact and require significant resources for change. Lenders, Lender Technology Providers, Appraisal Management Companies (AMCs), Appraisal Software Providers, and Appraisers will need to devote time and resources to this evolution. In this list of stakeholders, I am most closely aligned with Appraisal Software Providers and Appraisers themselves. How will the new UAD standard affect these two stakeholders? First, let’s talk about Appraisal Software Providers. Appraisers have grown accustomed to the appraisal software they utilize and are reluctant to change. There are numerous reasons for this hesitancy. In their software, appraisers have historical files that they may want to refer to, they have extensive template language already developed, and frankly they’re just used to it. Because of these and other factors, appraisal software companies have had “sticky” subscribers. Most software companies have a static number of users; very few appraisers change software vendors, and there have been a very low volume of new appraisers entering the industry. With the introduction of the new UAD standard, appraisal software companies can expect a reshuffling of their subscriber base. The new output going to the GSEs will be highly commoditized into a singular report output. The legacy way of “filling out forms” and providing efficiencies for this matching the requirements of these forms is going away. Because of the dynamic nature of the new dataset, the way of producing a report will be completely disrupted. No longer will appraisers find the right field and check the right box. Reports in the new standard, will be dynamic, expanding and contracting, based on the scope of work for that appraisal assignment. Software vendors will be challenged to build this process flow in the most efficient manner possible while adhering to the strict data standards set out by a new UAD. What will set one software vendor apart from another is how efficient they make this process for the appraiser. The introduction of the new appraisal standard creates an environment where all software providers, both established and emerging, must develop solutions that adhere to these updated requirements. This necessitates innovation and adaptation, potentially narrowing the technological and market advantage that existing providers might have had. Newer companies can enter the market on more equal footing, offering fresh perspectives and innovative features. This could lead to increased competition, driving improvements in software functionality, user experience, and customer service. Ultimately, this scenario benefits appraisers, as they will have access to a wider range of improved software options tailored to the new standards. Astute appraisers will enjoy this champion-challenger environment the new data standard brings. Rather than sticking with their “old standby” software vendor, they will be able to evaluate what all software companies are bringing to the table. All the barriers to change will fall away. There will not be historical files in the brand-new systems, it is a fresh start. Templating language will be a thing of the past with more discrete data points and less narration. And certainly, nobody will be used to the “old way of doing things “in this new dynamic report environment. Appraisers who have been with one software company, most of their careers, might find themselves continuing their practice with a completely different vendor. Mortgage appraisers will benefit from these software changes for the reasons described above, but there are some other things to consider. Most appraisers have diversity in their business channels. In addition to mortgage work, they may do legal work, estates as well as many other channels of business. The UAD standard is for mortgage work only and specifically for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Appraisers will want to make sure that their software vendors can accommodate non-lending work in their new platforms. Hopefully, some of the software vendors will embrace the “scope of work” concept and design alternative appraisal reporting with a similar process. Appraisers will want to avoid having two software platforms, one for lending, and one for non-lending. Again, appraisal software companies will compete for meeting these needs as well. There are other concerns as well. Some appraisers will express apprehension about adapting to the new standards, particularly regarding the shift from narrative descriptions to more discrete data input. This change could potentially impact the appraisal of complex properties, where nuanced details are crucial. Additionally, the need for technology upgrades and training to adapt to these new systems poses a challenge, especially for smaller firms or individual appraisers. The comprehensive overhaul of the UAD by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac marks a significant milestone in the evolution of the real estate appraisal industry. By moving away from the limitations of traditional forms and embracing a more adaptable, descriptive reporting format, this initiative promises to enhance the accessibility and quality of appraisal reports. While the transition demands significant adaptation and investment from all involved, the potential benefits—increased transparency, efficiency, and understanding—make a compelling case for embracing this change. As the industry navigates through these transformations, the focus must remain steadfast on the ultimate objective: to refine and improve the appraisal reporting process for the benefit of all stakeholders involved.",https://appraisalbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/business-4561935_1280-e1712090752800.webp,2024-04-15,-0.314,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'UAD', 'latitude': 7.155179977416992, 'longitude': 29.679140090942383, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Res', 'latitude': 42.58277893066406, 'longitude': 19.8075008392334, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are overhauling the Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) to improve accessibility and quality of appraisal reports.

The risks from this shift could expose the housing market to more instability, similar to the loosening of lending standards that preceded the 2008 financial crisis . This proposal is deeply concerning — not only for the risks it presents to the housing market, but also for the implications for South Carolina’s small businesses and broader economy. According to a recent study, the title industry directly contributes 800 jobs and $99 million to South Carolina’s gross domestic product annually. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle share these concerns and have introduced the bipartisan Protecting America’s Property Rights Act, which would require title insurance on all loans purchased by the government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae. I urge Sen. Tim Scott to help pass this bill and call on the Biden administration to rethink its misguided title insurance waiver pilot program. To be clear: Making homeownership more attainable for all Americans is a worthy goal and should be a key priority for the administration. However, the best way to do that is by addressing the true barriers to homeownership — burdensome regulations and a lack of housing supply. While saving homeowners a few hundred bucks is a good talking point, the reality is that this pilot program is too risky for South Carolina and too risky for the country. Let’s prioritize protecting one of the biggest purchases of a person’s life — a home. Cutting corners could be costly.

Three REITs With New Downgrades This Week - Yahoo Finance UK,Three REITs With New Downgrades This Week  Yahoo Finance UK,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 19:30:11 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdWsuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aHJlZS1yZWl0cy1kb3duZ3JhZGVzLXdlZWstMTkzMDExMDQwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance UK,"It's difficult for investors when analysts downgrade their stocks. But there are many reasons for an analyst downgrade. Sometimes a stock has risen to the point where the analyst feels it's no longer a good value relative to its price. At other times, competition, a perceived downturn in the general economy or the resignation of a longstanding company insider may lead the analyst to believe that a company is unlikely to perform well in the coming months. Whatever the reason, the usual outcome from a downgrade is a drop in the share price. But the drop may be temporary if the company develops new business, economic forecasts improve or new leadership proves its merit. Take a look at three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that have just received analyst downgrades and some of the concerns that warranted those decisions. TPG RE Finance Trust Inc. (NYSE:TRTX), a subsidiary of TPG Real Estate, is a mortgage REIT with a $4.2 billion portfolio of first mortgage loans with an average loan size of $71.6 million, in geographically diversified primary and select secondary markets across the U.S. On February 20, TPG RE Finance Trust reported its Q4 operating results. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.05 missed the estimate of $0.17. Revenue of $31.49 million was ahead of estimates of $24.73 million but below revenue from Q4 2022 of $35.99 million.

Unlock Real Wealth with Cityfunds’ Exclusive 8% Yield Fund. Despite the less-than-favorable earnings report, the earnings call was upbeat, and investors have continued to support the stock. Year-to-date, TPG RE Finance has had a total return of 16.33%. On April 12, Raymond James analyst Stephen Laws downgraded TPG RE Finance Trust from Strong Buy to Outperform while maintaining the price target at $8.50. This is still above the consensus average one-year price target of $7.90. Arbor Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:ABR) is a Long Island-based mortgage REIT (mREIT) that initiates bridge and mezzanine loans for commercial and residential properties. Many of its loans originate through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. Arbor Realty Trust generates profits by the spread between the loan financing cost and the interest earned from that loan. Many of Arbor Realty Trust's commercial loans are first mortgage liens that are short-term with higher interest rates. Arbor Realty's mid-February quarterly report was somewhat mixed. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.51 beat the consensus estimate of $0.44 per share, but it was 15% below EPS of $0.60 in Q4 2022. Revenue of $103.58 million also beat the consensus estimate of $97.65 million but decreased from $113.06 million in Q4 2022. On April 11, Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless downgraded Arbor Realty Trust from Outperform to Neutral and lowered the price target by 23.5% from $17 to $13. McCanless is concerned about higher interest rates for longer and the subsequent risks that Arbor Realty will incur for more delinquencies and non-performing loans. In addition, he sees the potential for lower loan volume. The analyst lowered the EPS estimate from $1.95 to $1.80 for 2024. Trending Want to Create a Passive Income Stream? These High-Yield Real Estate Notes Might Be Your Holy Grail Clipper Realty Inc. (NYSE:CLPR) is a small, New York-based, self-administered and self-managed REIT that owns, manages, operates and repositions multifamily residential and commercial properties in the New York City area. It was formed in 2017. On March 14, Clipper Realty reported its Q4 2023 operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.15 per share beat the estimate of $0.13 per share and represented a 36.36% increase from FFO of $0.11 per share in Q4 2022. Revenue of $34.87 million was below the consensus estimate of $37.28 million but slightly above revenue of $33.01 million in Q4 2022. On April 11, JMP Securities analyst Aaron Hecht downgraded Clipper Realty from Market Outperform to Market Perform. Hecht noted Clipper's recent announcement as part of its Q4 earnings report that it is losing its tenant at 12-story 250 Livingston Street in Brooklyn at the end of its lease in August 2025. The tenant is the City of New York, and the annual rent is $15.4 million. While that gives Clipper plenty of time to re-lease the space, the analyst also noted that the tenant in this 294,144 square-foot commercial and residential building accounts for approximately 15% of Clipper's net operating income. This creates what Hecht called ""tenant uncertainty,"" and Hecht believes that Clipper Realty is now fairly valued. Read Next: Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

On a quarterly basis, home prices rose a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent in Q1 2024, essentially the same as the growth in Q4 2023. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, home prices also increased by 1.7 percent in Q1 2024. ""Home prices continued to rise in the first quarter as the housing market remained seriously supply constrained,"" said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. ""The stabilization of mortgage rates in the 6.6 to 6.7 percent range in January helped to boost demand early in the first quarter, with existing home sales and mortgage applications both rising. Mortgage rates have trended upward again of late, but there is support for home prices in strong demographic demand from younger generations. We expect home sales to rise modestly this year as potential homebuyers appear to be acclimating to the higher-rate environment and, in some cases, may be less able to put off moving for life reasons."" The FNM-HPI is produced by aggregating county-level data to create both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted national indices that are representative of the whole country and designed to serve as indicators of general single-family home price trends. The FNM-HPI is publicly available at the national level as a quarterly series with a start date of Q1 1975 and extending to the most recent quarter, Q1 2024. Fannie Mae publishes the FNM-HPI approximately mid-month during the first month of each new quarter.

Harvard Study Again Stirs the Pot on Demotech Ratings of Florida Carriers - Claims Journal,Harvard Study Again Stirs the Pot on Demotech Ratings of Florida Carriers  Claims Journal,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 05:00:08 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNsYWltc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvMjAyNC8wNC8xNy8zMjMwNTEuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Claims Journal,"A study by researchers from Harvard and Columbia universities and at the Federal Reserve has reopened the debate about the financial fortitude and the financial rating system for dozens of Florida property insurance companies. The president of Demotech, the firm that rates the vast majority of Florida-domiciled carriers, said the study was incomplete, out of date, and was a continuation of a “hit job” that began in 2022, after Demotech reportedly warned that it planned to downgrade multiple Florida insurers. “One of the authors contacted us yet never responded when I offered to send whatever data she needed,” Petrelli said in an email. Petrelli did not respond to Insurance Journal when asked for clarification on some of his other points. Demotech’s “A” financial stability ratings have long been considered to be roughly equivalent to AM Best’s “B”-level ratings, which are strong enough for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the quasi-governmental entities (GSEs) that buy mortgages and require homes to be insured. But the study found that Demotech’s examinations and ratings are not as rigorous. “In particular, our estimates imply that close to 67% of Demotech insurers would not meet Freddie Mac’s eligibility requirement and 21% would not meet Fannie Mae’s requirement (at a 90% confidence level),” reads the paper. “Overall, these results strongly suggest inconsistencies in the GSE eligibility requirements across rating agencies. These inconsistencies could encourage ratings shopping, in particular among poor quality insurers who would not otherwise meet GSE eligibility.” The Florida Association of Insurance Agents’ president, who was one of several officials who sharply criticized Demotech in 2022, declined to comment about the study. But others in the insurance industry, including Florida regulators and some reinsurers, have questioned the soundness of Demotech’s rating system, warning that the firm has been inconsistent and has not followed its own criteria at times. Despite Demotech’s strong ratings of several Florida carriers, for example, Everest Re Group last year dropped some Florida insurers from its portfolio, noting that they did not meet underwriting standards. And in Arkansas last fall, United Home Insurance Co. was rated highly by Demotech – just days before it was placed in receivership. The uproar over Demotech’s ratings was so strong in 2022 that Florida officials and some insurers called for a new approach – switching to KBRA, formerly known as Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or establishing a state-run rating agency. In the ensuing months, though, the state plan received little attention from Florida lawmakers. And only a handful of Florida carriers moved over to KBRA. Petrelli and others have been quick to remind Floridians that much of the Florida-grown insurance market may not exist without Demotech’s ratings. After Hurricane Andrew slammed south Florida in 1992, a number of major national carriers pulled out of the state. As smaller, Florida-domiciled insurers cropped up to fill the gap, Demotech was often the only firm that would provide examinations and ratings, allowing the new carriers to write homes with Fannie- and Freddie-backed mortgages. The recent study, by Paranitha Sastry of Columbia, Ishita Sen of Harvard, and Ana-Maria Tenekedjieva of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, finds “that these new insurers would not meet GSE eligibility thresholds if subjected to traditional rating agencies’ methodologies.” That causes mortgage lenders to sell a large portion of their loans to Fannie and Freddie. And that, in turn, leads the GSEs to bear a large share of insurance counterparty risk, “driven by their mis-calibrated insurer eligibility requirements and lax insurance regulation.” The Demotech ratings have inconsistencies and are not as meaningful as one would hope, co-author Sen told the Tampa Bay Times last week. A statement from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae said the organizations review insurance company ratings, but do not try to influence the rating firms’ methodologies. The study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, raises its own questions and examines issues that some would say are old news in Florida. It also appears to refer to Demotech as an “emerging rating agency,” despite the fact that Demotech has been in business for more than 40 years. And the review is based partly on data resulting from Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida in 2017. The analysis noted that fragile insurance carriers may have caused some homeowners to default on the loans, perhaps after suffering heavy losses in hurricanes and being unable to recoup full replacement value from their insurance policies. The authors recommend that insurers should be rated by at least two rating firms. The report came amid a growing sense of relief in the Florida market, after four years of insolvencies and soaring premiums. One carrier, Florida Peninsula, recently announced a slight reduction in average rates in the state. And in the last 18 months, Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation has approved eight new carriers. Five of those were recently granted “A” stability ratings by Demotech. The startup known as Manatee Insurance Exchange, part of Safepoint Holdings Inc., was rated “A” by Demotech but received a “BBB” rating from KBRA. Ditto for Orange Insurance Exchange. Orion180 Insurance Co. was rated as “A” by Demotech and “BBB+” by KBRA. Two other startups have yet to be rated by any of the three rating firms. Mainsail, part of Spinnaker Insurance, is not rated by Demotech but won an “A-” or Excellent rating from AM Best. The Harvard/Columbia report can be seen here.

I am intentionally building a team and culture that supports that vision,” Malek said in a statement. “Steve is the real deal and cares deeply about the people, the culture, and the work. He is already bringing magic to our creative product and growing client roster.” Denekas comes to Crispin from Basic/Dept and Dept, where he was chief creative officer and global senior vice president. Denekas entered advertising at BBDO, where he learned how advertising and design worked best and how kindness brings out the best in creative teams. He was later at Wieden+Kennedy, Stagwell and Instrument. Denekas has worked with brands including Levi’s, Nike and Dodge. Malek joined Crispin in 2023. Prior to that, she was CEO of Houston-based MMI Agency. Under her leadership, the integrated creative agency saw rapid growth, along with client and staff retention. She is also a U.S. Army veteran. “The first brief from Maggie was to define the next 20 years of advertising.

Is the Housing Market on the Brink in 2024: Boom or Bust? - Digital Journal,Is the Housing Market on the Brink in 2024: Boom or Bust?  Digital Journal,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 08:21:33 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9wci9uZXdzL2dsb2JlLXByLXdpcmUvaG91c2luZy1tYXJrZXQtYnJpbmstMjAyNC1ib29tLTE0MDA4ODk1NjQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Digital Journal,"A common question on many people's minds is whether the U.S. housing market will crash again. To address this concern, it's essential to consider various expert analyses and economic indicators that provide insight into the future of real estate. The forecasts show that the housing market in 2024 is expected to continue grappling with high home prices and elevated mortgage rates, which have been a significant barrier to homeownership for many. Fannie Mae's senior vice president and chief economist, Doug Duncan, suggests that the market will likely face continued affordability constraints due to these high prices and interest rates. However, there is an anticipation of an increase in home sales transactions compared to the previous year, with a slower rise in home prices. Other market analysts predict a gradual thaw in the market with added challenges. Their forecasts suggest that as mortgage rates slowly fall, more buyers and sellers will enter the market, stabilizing housing prices. This stability is expected to be influenced by various factors, including demographic shifts and the impacts of climate change. Zillow's forecast aligns with the notion of a stable market, projecting a modest 0.2% decrease in home values nationally, indicating a trend towards market stability rather than a sharp decline. Some of the forecasts offer a slightly more optimistic view, predicting that prices will begin to rise again in most US cities, albeit at a slower pace that reflects historical norms. This suggests that while some markets may experience a rebound, others that have seen a more significant downturn might take longer to recover. There could be moderate appreciation in the housing market from 2024-2028, with regional disparities emerging. The Southern region, in particular, is expected to see substantial home price growth. Factors That Could Influence a Housing Market Crash in 2024 The stability of the housing market is a topic of significant interest and concern for homeowners, investors, and policymakers alike. As we look ahead to 2024, several factors could potentially lead to a downturn in the housing market. Understanding these factors is crucial for anyone involved in the real estate sector. One of the primary concerns is the possibility of rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve has been increasing rates to combat inflation, which could lead to higher mortgage rates and, consequently, a decrease in housing affordability. This could result in reduced demand for homes, as potential buyers may find it more challenging to secure financing. Inflation itself is another factor that could impact the housing market. Currently, at a 40-year high, inflation erodes consumers' purchasing power, making it more difficult for them to afford homes at current prices. If wages do not keep pace with inflation, this could further strain the market A potential recession is also a concern that economists are warning about. If the US economy were to enter a recession in 2024, it could lead to job losses and a decrease in consumer confidence, which would likely reduce the demand for housing. Another factor to consider is the level of household debt. With mortgages, credit cards, and student loans leading the way, household debt has recently surpassed $17 trillion. High levels of debt can limit consumers' ability to take on additional mortgage debt, potentially slowing down the housing market. Supply disruptions, along with rising labor and raw construction materials costs, have been identified as contributing factors to sustained real house price gains. These issues could exacerbate the affordability crisis and lead to a market correction. The housing market's connection to economic fundamentals is also a point of analysis. When the market becomes unhinged from these fundamentals, such as shifts in disposable income and the cost of credit, it can lead to speculative bubbles. If many buyers operate under a 'fear of missing out' and drive up prices, this can heighten expectations of strong house-price gains and potentially lead to a bubble burst. Lastly, regional disparities could play a role. While some areas may see substantial home price growth, others that have experienced significant downturns might take longer to recover. This uneven growth can create pockets of instability within the broader market. In summary, while the term ""crash"" may not accurately describe the state of the US housing market in 2024, it is clear that the market is undergoing a period of adjustment. The consensus among experts points towards a market that is stabilizing and adapting to new economic conditions, rather than collapsing. As always, potential homebuyers and sellers should stay informed and consider their circumstances when navigating the housing market.

On a quarterly basis, home prices rose a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent in Q1 2024, essentially the same as the growth in Q4 2023. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, home prices also increased by 1.7 percent in Q1 2024. ""Home prices continued to rise in the first quarter as the housing market remained seriously supply constrained,"" said Doug Duncan , Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. ""The stabilization of mortgage rates in the 6.6 to 6.7 percent range in January helped to boost demand early in the first quarter, with existing home sales and mortgage applications both rising. Mortgage rates have trended upward again of late, but there is support for home prices in strong demographic demand from younger generations. We expect home sales to rise modestly this year as potential homebuyers appear to be acclimating to the higher-rate environment and, in some cases, may be less able to put off moving for life reasons."" The FNM-HPI is produced by aggregating county-level data to create both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted national indices that are representative of the whole country and designed to serve as indicators of general single-family home price trends. The FNM-HPI is publicly available at the national level as a quarterly series with a start date of Q1 1975 and extending to the most recent quarter, Q1 2024. Fannie Mae publishes the FNM-HPI approximately mid-month during the first month of each new quarter.

I want to talk about that below and share some trends. Skim by topic or digest slowly. UPCOMING SPEAKING GIGS: 4/25/24 HomeSmart iCare Realty (details TBA) 4/26/24 Prime Real Estate (private) 5/9/24 Empire Home Loans (details TBA) 5/15/24 Investor Meetup (details TBA) 6/6/24 Golden 1 Credit Union (details TBA) 6/11/24 Elk Grove Regional MLS Meeting 8:30am 6/13/24 Sacramento Realtist Association (details TBA) CONSUMERS ARE JUGGLING This is a meme I made a few days back, and unfortunately it perfectly describes the moment. And this is why mortgage rate increases lately aren’t easy to digest since buyers are already juggling so much. STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET Look, you don’t have to be a practicing real estate professional to have a housing take or know the market. I’ll be honest. It bugs me when people are told to stay in their lane because they don’t work in a field. As if I can’t have an opinion about Taylor Swift since I’m not a musician. Or I can’t talk about basketball because I don’t play for the Kings (put me in coach). Or an athlete can’t talk about politics because she isn’t a politician (oh, that one got real). Of course, there is such a thing as expertise, so I’m not planning to lecture today about paleontology or the history of communism. Haha. When it comes to housing, there are some people spewing opinions that are pretty disconnected from the actual market since the narrative just doesn’t line up with what it’s like in the trenches. I find this to be especially prominent with a housing crash narrative that paints everything with darkness, but doesn’t tend to concede it’s been competitive.This can happen on the rosy side too when people aren’t willing to look at red flags in the marketplace because they’re distracted by multiple offers. Ultimately, some people only want to promote a narrative, and I find that to be very limiting because the market isn’t just one thing. We ARE really struggling with affordability, AND the market has been intense considering the lack of affordability. In short, everyone gets to have an opinion, but not every opinion has credibility. On that note, how do you gauge credibility for a housing analyst? And does credibility even matter to people today? Long story short. 54% of pendings over the past week had multiple offers in the Sacramento region in the midst of rate hikes, so it’s not totally frozen like some people are saying. Of course, could the housing temperature change very quickly ahead if rates continue to rise? You betcha. Do you know what would be surprising? If the temperature didn’t change with rates around 7.5%. GETTING CLARIFICATION ON CONCESSIONS In light of the NAR lawsuit, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac clarified yesterday that if a seller pays for the buyer’s agent commission, it will NOT count within the allowable amount for concessions (as long as it remains customary for sellers to cover the buyer’s side of the commission in the marketplace). This isn’t new policy, but it’s nice to have some clarity since we’ve been wondering. I wrote about concessions a few weeks ago, and I updated the post with links to the press releases. I also posted on my socials yesterday, and the posts have quite a bit of attention. SELLER GREED ISN’T SEXY I talked to a real estate agent this week who has an upset seller that the property didn’t go even higher above the asking price. Bro, it’s not 2021 out there, so don’t expect that dynamic. Technically, if you’re a seller wanting a bidding war, just price lower. Don’t expect buyers to go substantially above value though in a market where affordability is a struggle. LOOKING FOR HOUSING TEMPERATURE CHANGE One of the things I’m watching closely right is what sellers are giving buyers in terms of concessions. What are you noticing? About 38% of sales last month had concessions in Sacramento County, and it’s normal to see this number decline during a traditional spring. Do we start to see sellers have to offer more to buyers ahead if rates persist higher? My advice to sellers is to listen closely to what buyers need, and be open to lowering the price and/or offering concessions if the market requires. Please don’t take rate increases lightly. Go to a mortgage calculator to see how much it costs to buy your house right now. MORE ADVICE FOR BUYERS PLEASE Agent friends, I’d love to see more content that focuses on the buyer side. How do you get an offer accepted? How can a buyer get concessions in a market like today? What types of situations do you recommend offering below the list price? When do you need to go above? Often real estate professionals focus heavily on sellers, but buyers need attention and help right now. EXPECT LOWER DEMAND In coming weeks, we’re going to understand more about how higher rates are affecting buyers and sellers. I’d be shocked if the number of pendings didn’t dip if rates keep this high, but only time will tell. No matter what, we’ll see the trend first in the listings and pendings. If we only look to sales, it’ll be a month or two to see the trend since it takes time for properties to get into contract and close. Remember, the stories of today turn into the stats of tomorrow. So far, pendings and new listings for April as a whole have been pretty normal seasonally (still way lower than usual though). But let’s watch very closely ahead from this week onward. SOME ENCOURAGEMENT A few thoughts I shared on my social channels yesterday. Just some things on my mind. I wanted to offer some encouragement in the midst of what feels like uncertainty salad in the economy and real estate market. WATCH GROWTH IN LISTINGS I had the hardest time explaining this until I used blocks. In the fall of 2023, I made a reel with blocks to explain how listings can grow. At the time, we were seeing more active listings, but it wasn’t really due to sellers rushing the market. Well, today we’re legit having more new listings, but it’s still buyer behavior that can make the biggest difference. View this post on Instagram Thanks for being here. Questions: What are you seeing in the market right now? What are buyers and sellers saying? What do you think of Fannie Mae’s clarification on commissions? I’d love to hear your take.

Many lenders will issue government-backed FHA and VA loans to borrowers with credit scores starting at 580. Some lenders even offer FHA loans with a credit score as low as 500, though this is far less common. With a credit score above 600, your options open up even more. Conventional mortgages require only a 620 score to qualify. And with a credit score of 680 or higher, you could apply for just about any home loan. Verify your home loan eligibility. Start here In this article (Skip to...) Lowest score to buyWhat is bad credit?Home loans for bad creditBad credit mortgage lendersGetting a bad credit home loanFAQ Can I buy a house with bad credit? Yes, you can buy a house with bad credit. While getting approved for a home loan with bad credit is challenging, it’s not impossible. Check your home loan options. Start here Across the industry, the lowest possible credit score to get a mortgage loan is 500. However, it’s important to note that mortgage lenders willing to accommodate such low scores are few and far between. Additionally, these lenders usually charge higher interest rates to offset the risk associated with lending to borrowers with poor credit histories. What do mortgage lenders consider a bad credit score? The definition of a bad credit score varies between mortgage lenders. But, as a rule of thumb, the FICO scoring model considers scores below 580 to be “poor” or “bad.” If you’re looking for a mortgage with a credit score below 620, it may be considered a “low credit mortgage.” Verify your home loan eligibility. Start here FICO credit score ranges: Below 580: Bad credit580 to 669: Fair credit670 to 739: Good credit740 or above: Excellent credit Still, some home buyers can qualify for a home loan with a FICO score as low as 500, depending on the loan program. Home loans for bad credit Home buyers seeking bad credit home loans have multiple programs to choose from. Yet, the FHA loan stands out as the most common mortgage option for those with poor credit histories. When comparing home loans for bad credit, evaluate the loan terms, interest rates, and monthly payments to determine which suits your personal finances best. Verify your home loan eligibility. Start here Although each loan program and lender has its own unique credit score requirements and minimum down payments, here’s what you can generally expect to see: FHA loan: 500 credit score An FHA mortgage is a government-backed loan guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. This is why they’re a good option for borrowers with bad credit. You can qualify for an FHA loan with a low credit score of 500 and a 10% down payment, or 3.5% down if your FICO is 580 or above. FHA loans accept applicants with credit scores as low as 500.Applicants with scores between 500 and 579 need a 10% down payment.Borrowers with low or bad credit may pay higher mortgage interest rates, but FHA loan rate increases are typically lower than conventional loans.An upfront and annual mortgage insurance premium (MIP) is required, which adds to the loan’s overall cost. Another appealing quality is that, unlike conventional loans, FHA-backed mortgages don’t carry risk-based pricing. This is also known as “loan-level pricing adjustments” (LLPAs). Risk-based pricing is a fee added to loan applications with lower credit scores or other less-than-ideal traits. Check your FHA loan eligibility. Start here FHA loans are a strong option if you’re seeking home loans with bad credit. This type of mortgage offers lenient qualifying credit requirements and no risk-based pricing adjustments. Non-qualified mortgage (Non-QM): 500 credit score Non-QM loans offer a more flexible lending criteria for those who do not meet the strict qualifications of conventional mortgages, with some available to borrowers with credit scores as low as 500. Tailored for applicants unable to qualify for mainstream home loans.Usually charge higher interest rates compared to other types of loans. For individuals with bad credit, non-QM loans provide an alternative path to homeownership, albeit with potentially higher costs. Check your bad credit home loan options. Start here If you’re interested in a non-QM loan, check out the specialty mortgage programs some banks and credit unions offer that are neither conventional loans nor government-backed. Or, work with a mortgage broker who can recommend products from various lenders that might fit your needs. VA loan: 580 credit score The Department of Veterans Affairs offers VA loans to veterans, active-duty service members, and some military-affiliated borrowers. VA loans do not require a down payment or ongoing mortgage insurance payments. VA loans do not have a minimum credit score, but lenders typically prefer a minimum of 580 to 620.Borrowers with lower credit scores get rates comparable to those with higher credit scores.VA loans are renowned for offering the lowest interest rates available.A one-time funding fee is included, which most borrowers roll into their closing costs. Verify your VA loan eligibility. Start here VA loans are among the best options for financing a home for those who qualify, regardless of credit history. Conventional loan: 620 credit score Conventional loans are arguably the most common type of mortgage. Borrowers with low credit scores may wish to consider alternative options because a conventional loan would most likely have higher interest rates and fees. A minimum credit score of 620 is generally required.Loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs) are based on credit score and loan-to-value ratio (LTV).Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is required for down payments of less than 20% of the home purchase price. As your LTV rises and your credit score falls, your fee goes up. For instance, a borrower with a 20% down payment and a 700 credit score will pay 1.25% of the loan amount in LLPAs. But an applicant with a 640 score and 10% down will be charged a fee of 2.75%. Verify your conventional loan eligibility. Start here Still, despite the higher costs associated with lower credit scores, conventional loans remain a viable option for many, with FHA loans often presenting a more cost-effective route for bad-credit borrowers. Fannie Mae HomeReady: 620 credit score The HomeReady program by Fannie Mae offers an avenue for low- to moderate-income borrowers to secure financing with just a 3% down payment. A minimum credit score of 620.Available to both first-time and repeat home buyers.Offers reduced rates for private mortgage insurance compared to standard conventional loans. Verify your HomeReady eligibility. Start here HomeReady is an excellent program for those looking to finance homes in low-income communities. Freddie Mac Home Possible: 660 credit score Freddie Mac’s first-time home buyer program, Home Possible, can help buyers get into homes with a 3% down payment. Minimum credit score of 660Must be a first-time home buyerDown payment assistance programs are available for those unable to save the required down payment. Verify your Home Possible eligibility. Start here This loan program is particularly well suited for first-time home buyers with moderate credit. USDA loan: 640 credit score USDA loans are popular with home buyers in qualifying rural areas because they offer zero-down payment options and competitive mortgage rates. Applicants need a minimum 640 credit score to qualify.The property must be situated in a designated rural area.Household income cannot exceed 115% of the area median income (AMI).Whether you’re purchasing a home or refinancing your current mortgage with a USDA loan, you’ll pay a 1% upfront guarantee fee and a 0.35% annual fee. Verify your USDA loan eligibility. Start here A USDA mortgage is a government-backed loan guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This is why USDA loans are a great option for people looking to buy real estate in a rural area because they have flexible credit requirements and require no down payment. Bad credit mortgage lenders A less-than-perfect FICO score doesn’t mean you’re confined to dealing with subpar mortgage lenders. Surprisingly, some top-tier lenders specialize in assisting borrowers whose credit scores hover around or even dip below 600. While it’s true that qualification may not be possible for everyone and your interest rate might be above what a “prime” mortgage borrower would receive, you have just as much right to seek out the best mortgage rates, fees, and customer service. Don’t let your credit score deter you from exploring all available options. For comprehensive advice on finding the right lender for your situation, check out our guide to the best bad credit mortgage lenders. This resource lists the top lenders specifically catering to bad credit home loans, helping you make an informed decision that aligns with your needs. How to get a home loan for bad credit Improving your chances of getting a bad credit home loan may seem daunting, but there are strategies to boost your loan approval odds. As you begin the loan application process, mortgage underwriters will review your entire financial history. If your credit is low but the rest of your financial picture looks good, you’re more likely to get approved. Check your home loan options. Start here By following these proven steps, you can significantly improve your appeal to lenders and streamline your home buying process. Check your free credit report for accuracy The three major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) make mistakes sometimes. Your creditors can report inaccurate information to the credit bureaus, too. Monitor your credit history to notice errors before they lower your score. The government has set up a website where you can check your credit accounts free: annualcreditreport.com Dispute inaccurate information If you do find inaccurate information in your credit history, be sure to file a dispute, especially if the errors include huge blemishes like foreclosures, repossessions, or collections accounts. Collections accounts can linger on your credit reports for years. They can negatively impact your financial standing even after they’re paid, as paying off a collection upgrades its status to “Paid” but doesn’t remove it from your report. Negotiating for its complete removal, known as “Pay for Delete,” by contacting the collection agency and offering payment in exchange for deletion from your credit report is a game-changer. Always ensure this agreement is in writing before making any payments, effectively erasing the financial mishap and potentially boosting your credit score. Get mortgage loan preapproval Securing mortgage preapproval is a pivotal step for buyers with bad credit. It not only clarifies your budget but also boosts your appeal to sellers. The preapproval process can also pinpoint where to improve your credit so be honest about your finances when seeking preapproval; lenders may suggest programs for credit issues. Lower your DTI and credit utilization ratios Lenders evaluate your debt-to-income ratio, or DTI, to determine if you can afford a new monthly mortgage payment. Reducing existing debts before submitting a mortgage application can make qualifying for a home loan easier. Similarly, paying down credit card debt and personal loan balances also lowers your credit utilization ratio. Credit utilization measures your debt balance against your credit limit. For instance, a $7,000 balance on a $10,000 credit limit results in a 70% ratio, which is considered high. Aiming for a utilization ratio of 30% or lower can significantly boost your credit score. Improve your payment history Missed and late payments will lower your FICO score. Be sure to make on-time payments on all your loans and credit cards. It’s a good idea to set your accounts on autopay. Consider a co-signer If you’re unable to qualify for a mortgage due to a low credit score, you might want to consider bringing a co-signer into the equation. A co-signer essentially vouches for you, making lenders more comfortable with extending credit your way. In essence, you’re leveraging another person’s higher credit score and financial stability to boost your chances of securing that loan. That said, it’s crucial to understand the responsibilities and implications for both parties involved. The co-signer’s credit score will be affected, for better or worse, by the loan’s performance. Lenders might also average your credit scores, depending on their specific policies, which can make the loan more attainable. Nevertheless, your interest rates will often be based on the lower of the two scores, meaning you may pay a bit more over the life of the loan. Avoid unnecessary hard pulls First things first: not all credit checks are detrimental to your credit score. Soft inquiries, such as those conducted for background checks, don’t affect your score. However, hard inquiries, like the ones made when you apply for a new credit card or a loan, can lower your score a bit. Each hard pull can reduce your credit score by a few points. So always check whether the creditor will be performing a hard or soft pull on your credit report. Leverage home equity For homeowners who are unable to cash-out refinance due to bad credit, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a solution. A HELOC allows access to funds based on the equity built in the home. By tapping into home equity through a HELOC, individuals bypass the strict credit requirements of conventional cash-out refinancing. This approach can unlock cash for renovations, debt consolidation, or other financial needs, even when a poor credit score would typically close doors to such opportunities.

He resided with his parents in the St. Bernard Housing Project for many years prior to moving with his parents to the Lower Ninth Ward. He attended Booker T. Washington High School and Southern University in New Orleans. He was a lifelong resident of New Orleans until he joined the United States Air Force. Upon his discharge he then moved to Birmingham, Alabama where he worked at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. In New Orleans, he answered the Lord's call and embarked on becoming a Pastor in the Methodist Church, specifically St. Roch Methodist Church in New Orleans, Louisiana. He began his African Methodist Episcopal Pastoral services in 2012 at York Chapel A. M. E. Church. He was appointed to St. Peter-St. Paul A. M. E. Church on October 24, 2015.

Freddie Mac Tightens Lending Rules In Bid To Detect Fraud - Bisnow,Freddie Mac Tightens Lending Rules In Bid To Detect Fraud  Bisnow,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 22:58:48 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpc25vdy5jb20vbmF0aW9uYWwvbmV3cy9tdWx0aWZhbWlseS9mcmVkZGllLW1hYy10aWdodGVucy1sZW5kaW5nLXJ1bGVzLWluLWJpZC10by1kZXRlY3QtZnJhdWQtMTIzODI20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Bisnow,"Freddie Mac is rolling out new policies to help detect fraud and mitigate risks, the latest policy adjustments following two high-profile instances of alleged malfeasance in New York. The policy changes, which go into effect Thursday, impact capital underwriting and due diligence around Know Your Customer policies and appraisals. The changes mark the second significant policy shift since Freddie Mac launched an investigation into Meridian Capital Group in November. “Freddie Mac remains focused on risk management and works to enhance our processes to better detect and deter fraud and misrepresentation,” Ian Ouwerkerk, Freddie Mac's senior vice president of multifamily underwriting and credit, said in a statement. “We take these issues seriously, and these enhancements are just the latest step in our effort to manage risk and improve our execution.” The policy shifts are reflected in the government-sponsored entity’s new Multifamily Seller/Servicer Guide, to be released Thursday. They boost the number of unit inspections and the lease audit sample size for property inspections, along with requiring additional documentation to confirm the accuracy of reported tenant rent payments. The updated Know Your Customer requirements include additional due diligence for first-time borrowers or those with limited multifamily experience. The rules also call for enhanced liquidity verification for borrowers. Freddie Mac is also strengthening its appraisal review process and appraiser independence requirements to safeguard the “objectivity and impartiality of appraisers.” The lender will also update policies that limit business “with certain title companies when applicable” for its multifamily lending arm. The policy changes follow a November move from Freddie Mac to require that loan documentation come directly from borrowers and not from brokers involved in the transaction. Fannie Mae, the other federally backed purchaser of multifamily mortgages, made a similar move around the same time when it introduced a pre-review requirement for all agency-backed loans involving brokers. Freddie Mac is concerned that the position of the market in the real estate cycle could drive an increase in fraud attempts. The policy changes followed a November report that Freddie Mac was investigating Meridian Capital for allegedly fabricating numbers in applications to help clients get larger loans. The ongoing investigation caused Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to halt any transactions with Meridian. Brokers at the New York-based firm, one of the country’s largest brokers of commercial mortgages, have been blacklisted by Freddie Mac even if they left Meridian for other firms, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Meridian brokers have reportedly faced increased scrutiny amid the near-collapse of New York Community Bank, which used Meridian to find borrowers. No specific title companies are referenced in the new Freddie Mac rules, but Fannie Mae notified lenders in February that it would no longer accept loans from Riverside Abstract and Madison Title. The firms are linked to two deals with New York investor Boruch Drillman, who pleaded guilty in December to a years-long conspiracy to secure $165M in loans using fictitious documents. Neither firm was charged in the case. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are government-sponsored entities tasked with providing liquidity to the mortgage market. They have been overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since the 2008 financial crisis. Freddie Mac purchased more than $49B in multifamily loans in 2023, supporting 423,177 affordable rental units, while Fannie Mae closed the year with more than $52B in multifamily financing. The entities typically package the loans they acquire into securities and sell them to investors in the private market. Both agencies are capped at up to $70B each in multifamily loan purchases for 2024, not including mortgages they acquire for workforce housing.",https://imageserver-bisnow1.netdna-ssl.com/zma-QNGzfSrW3biW8VJ6F9wacmI=/710x484/publisher/662008a065f71-freddie-mac-headquarters-8200-branch-drive-mclean-virginia-washington-dc.jpeg,2024-04-17,-0.115,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meridian Capital Group', 'latitude': 40.703460693359375, 'longitude': -74.013427734375, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Meridian', 'latitude': 43.165618896484375, 'longitude': -76.5368881225586, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Street', 'latitude': 51.12472152709961, 'longitude': -2.740000009536743, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'York', 'latitude': 44.0513916015625, 'longitude': -79.48027801513672, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Riverside', 'latitude': 33.95335006713867, 'longitude': -117.39615631103516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Madison', 'latitude': 40.75981903076172, 'longitude': -74.41709899902344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

Wiley Nickel (D-NC)—who wrote a letter to President Biden expressing concerns regarding the administration's plan approved by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to waive title insurance on loans purchased by Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. ""While well-intentioned, this pilot program will not address the true issue of housing affordability in our communities and puts homebuyers at risk,"" the members wrote. ""Title insurance professionals halt fraudulent real estate transactions such as impersonation scams, elder financial exploitation, and attempts to defraud spouses, partners, or other property heirs. Under the new program, consumers and lenders will be forced into a completely experimental claims resolution process with the GSEs, ultimately risking being forced into property sale or foreclosure. We ask that you reconsider moving forward. While we understand the enormity of the housing affordability crisis, shifting risk from the well-regulated title insurance industry to the GSEs and pushing small businesses out of the real estate ecosystem is not the right path forward to address that crisis."" ""On behalf of title companies in every county nationwide, who work tirelessly every day to protect the American dream of homeownership, we commend the leadership of Rep. Nickel and his Democratic colleagues in raising serious concerns about the administration's title waiver pilot program,"" said ALTA CEO Diane Tomb. ""While well intentioned, this program is flawed—removing the expertise and protections provided by title professionals and doing little to promote homeownership affordability for those who need it the most while heightening risk at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It is encouraging to have such thoughtful Members of Congress who understand the importance of sound housing policy."" Other signers of the letter were Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-MA), Rep. Lou Correa (D-CA), Rep. Jim Costa (D-CA), Rep. Joe Courtney (D-CT), Rep. Angie Craig (D-MN), Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), Rep.

Jennifer Wexton (D-VA) and Rep. Nikema Williams (D-GA). To read the full letter, click here. The title waiver program has faced bipartisan backlash from Members of Congress since being revived ahead of the State of the Union. Last month, three Republican members from the House Financial Services Committee—Warren Davidson (R-OH), Bill Huizenga (R-MI) and Andrew Garbarino (R-NY)—wrote a letter to the FHFA questioning whether the program conflicts with the agency's Prior Approval for Enterprise Products rule.

Fannie Mae's New Mortgage-Scoring System Aims to Lift MBS Demand - Yahoo Finance,Fannie Mae's New Mortgage-Scoring System Aims to Lift MBS Demand  Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 16:12:32 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mYW5uaWUtbWFlLW1vcnRnYWdlLXNjb3Jpbmctc3lzdGVtLTE2MTIzMjM0NS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance,"(Bloomberg) -- Fannie Mae is selling agency mortgage backed securities designed to appeal to socially minded investors, as the mortgage giant looks to draw more buyers into the market to help fill a void left by the Federal Reserve stopping purchases. Most Read from Bloomberg Since March, the government-sponsored enterprise has been selling agency MBS that are scored according to a set of revamped criteria that gives extra weight to mortgages with certain characteristics, such as whether they’re used for affordable rental housing or are to borrowers in rural areas with high poverty levels. The goal is to give investors who buy MBS more visibility into the underlying mortgages. Greater availability of data can make it more attractive to buy MBS with loans to underserved borrowers, translating into lower interest rates to borrowers with those types of mortgages. “It costs money to originate one of these mortgages,” Fannie Mae Chief Executive Officer Priscilla Almodovar said in an interview, referring to the costs that lenders incur when they make mortgages to underserved borrowers. “This is the way for us to incentivize them.” The new program is an updated version of the “social” index first rolled out in late 2022. Change is needed, Almodovar said, because the agency MBS market is transitioning to a new era in which two of its biggest investor groups no longer hold the dominant roles in the market that they used to, or are missing in action altogether. Domestic banks have lessened participation and the Federal Reserve is letting MBS roll off its balance sheet. It’s hard to overstate how important those two players have been in the market the past 15 years, according to Devang Doshi, a senior vice president at Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae and sister groups Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae have issued around $4 trillion of MBS over that period — which Doshi said is nearly all accounted for by the Federal Reserve and domestic banks’ added holdings. “Mortgage rates are going to be dictated by asset managers and no longer the Fed’s portfolio,” he said, adding this is why Fannie Mae must take steps to ensure MBS are attractive to investors. Fannie Mae first auctioned mortgage bonds with Mission scores in March, with a second sale held earlier this month. Freddie Mac will begin applying the new Mission Index criteria to its own bonds starting in June. “It’s still too early to tell how effective the mission index will be in creating demand for underserved borrowers,” said Erica Adelberg, MBS strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence. “But there currently aren’t a lot of [MBS] pools that score high on the Mission rankings, so it seems like there’s room for upside.” Pools with high scores may not only appeal to investors looking to satisfy social mandates, Adelberg added, but also funds looking for more-favorable prepayment behavior. --With assistance from Stefani Reynolds.

Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are among those clarifying policies regarding how commissions could impact loans, Inman reported. While the seller side of a transaction is coming into focus, however, the new norms awaiting the buyer side remain elusive. Fannie and Freddie told lenders that sellers may continue to pay buyer agent commissions, as is standard, and that those payments won’t count against limits for “interested party contributions.” Fannie and Freddie restrict IPCs, or concessions that may benefit interested parties if homes sell for especially high prices, to between 2 and 9 percent of the property’s value. That protects lenders vulnerable to buyers paying more than a home’s actual worth, as buyers with home equity are less likely to be foreclosed upon. The Department of Housing and Urban Development appears to be in lockstep with Fannie and Freddie regarding FHA loans. HUD said sellers can pay buyer’s agent fees without that counting as a seller concession. While those decisions should help clarify existing policies, they don’t shed light on what happens if a buyer prefers to pay for their agent on their own and if that can be incorporated into a mortgage. The pending $418 million settlement by the National Association of Realtors of various legal actions would ultimately see commissions paid to buyer’s agents being removed from asking prices. Consumer Federation of America senior fellow Stephen Brobeck suggested in a report buyers would be more inclined to hire an agent if they were allowed to finance agent compensation through mortgages no larger than their current loans. One proposal on the table would see Fannie, Freddie and the FHA gain the power to guarantee loans slightly exceeding the appraised value of a home, so long as excess funds are used to pay non-recurring closing costs such as commissions. — Holden Walter-Warner",https://static.therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NATL-Mortgage-industry-contend-with-new-commission-rules-FEATUREIMG_v2.jpg,2024-04-18,-0.084,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Inman', 'latitude': 38.230281829833984, 'longitude': -97.77278137207031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HUD', 'latitude': 53.64799880981445, 'longitude': -1.784999966621399, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Federation', 'latitude': -28.83146095275879, 'longitude': 121.7739028930664, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Warner', 'latitude': 35.494258880615234, 'longitude': -95.3055191040039, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have clarified that sellers can continue to pay buyer agent commissions, and those payments won't count against limits for ""interested party contributions.""

First-time buyer loans typically have more flexible requirements, such as a lower down payment and credit score. Many help buyers with closing costs and the down payment through grants and low-interest loans. Here is our comprehensive guide to both first-time homebuyer loans and programs. What is a first-time homebuyer program? First-time homebuyer programs help make homeownership more affordable for people who haven’t ever owned a home (or haven’t owned a home in some time). These programs come in a variety of flavors, but usually include a mortgage with a better interest rate, lower down payment requirement and other upsides like down payment and closing costs assistance. Types of first-time homebuyer programs Low-down payment conventional loans: Conventional loan programs that require just 3 percent down Down payment assistance (DPA) programs: Loans, grants and matching programs to help you with your down payment Federal first-time homebuyer programs: Loans and programs backed or offered by the federal government State, non-profit and employer-sponsored programs: Homebuying assistance at the local level Along with these, first-time homebuyers who are students or in a certain profession might qualify for a special type of loan, as well. Below, we’ll break down what each of these programs entails: Low-down payment conventional loans Conventional loans are the most popular type of mortgage, and only require 3 percent down. This makes them an attractive option for first-time homebuyers who might not have considerable savings to draw from. These low-down payment loans include the: Conventional 97 mortgage: This conventional loan, backed by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, requires just 3 percent down and a minimum credit score of 620. It also requires you to pay for private mortgage insurance (PMI), a type of policy that protects your mortgage lender should you stop paying back your loan. You’ll pay these premiums until you pay down your balance to 80 percent of the value of your home. HomeReady mortgage: Similar to the Conventional 97 program, Fannie Mae’s HomeReady mortgage program also requires just 3 percent down (with PMI, although it might be less expensive). Home Possible mortgage: Freddie Mac’s Home Possible mortgage program is the counterpart to the HomeReady mortgage, with a 3 percent minimum down payment requirement. HomeOne mortgage: This Freddie Mac-backed mortgage also allows for just 3 percent down with PMI, but is available only to first-time homebuyers. You won’t get your low-down payment conventional loan directly from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Instead, you’ll work with a mortgage lender of your choosing, which might be a bank, online lender or credit union, for example. Through state housing finance agencies (HFAs), Fannie and Freddie also back another set of 3 percent down payment programs, called HFA Preferred and HFA Advantage, respectively. Down payment assistance (DPA) options There are many types of down payment assistance, including: Down payment assistance loans Many first-time homebuyer programs offer a lower-cost first mortgage to help you buy the home, then a second mortgage to help you cover your down payment and closing costs. These second mortgages are commonly structured as either: Low-interest loans: A low-interest second mortgage you’ll repay over the course of a few years Deferred-payment loans: A no-interest second mortgage you’ll repay when you sell the home, refinance or pay off your first mortgage Forgivable loans: A second mortgage you won’t have to pay back so long as you stay in the home for a certain amount of time (the exact period depends on the program) and stay up-to-date with your mortgage payments Down payment savings match Down payment savings match programs provide matched funds up to a certain amount. The money can only be used for your down payment and closing costs. One type of matched savings program is an Individual Development Account (IDA). If you qualify, you’ll work with an assigned counselor to deposit funds into an IDA over a set period of time. If you follow the savings plan, you’ll receive the match when you close on the home. Down payment grants A down payment or first-time homebuyer grant is essentially free money to help you cover your down payment or closing costs. The grants are usually awarded to low- or moderate-income borrowers, typically defined as those earning no more than 80 percent of the median income in their area. They might have other requirements, too, like a minimum credit score and maximum home purchase price. Federal first-time homebuyer programs Government-backed mortgage loans The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Agriculture (USDA) back mortgage programs that are often an option for first-time homebuyers. These loans aren’t created or funded by these agencies, however; they’re offered through approved mortgage lenders throughout the U.S. Some lenders even specialize in certain types. Here’s an overview: FHA loan: Insured by the Federal Housing Administration, FHA loans allow you to buy a home with a minimum credit score of 580 and as little as 3.5 percent down, or a credit score as low as 500 with at least 10 percent down. If you put down less than 20 percent, you’ll pay FHA mortgage insurance premiums (MIP), similar to the insurance you’d pay for a low-down payment conventional loan. The difference, though: You can’t stop paying FHA MIP unless you refinance out of an FHA loan entirely. VA loan: The VA guarantees home loans for eligible U.S. military members (active duty, veterans and surviving spouses). These don’t require a down payment, though there is a funding fee. USDA loan: USDA loans don’t require a down payment, but you’ll need to purchase in a designated rural area and all under area-specific income limits to qualify. Good Neighbor Next Door The Good Neighbor Next Door program, overseen by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is geared toward law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and pre-kindergarten through 12th grade teachers. If you work in one of these professions, you could buy a home in a “revitalization area” for 50 percent off, provided you live in the home for at least three years. You can search for properties available in your state on the program’s website. HomePath Ready Buyer Program Fannie Mae’s HomePath ReadyBuyer program is geared toward first-time buyers interested in a foreclosed home. After taking a required online homebuyer education course, you can receive up to 3 percent in closing cost assistance toward the purchase of a property that’s been foreclosed and is now owned by Fannie Mae.This program isn’t for everyone, however: Not only are you limited in your choice of properties, but the options (like many foreclosed homes) might need lots of repairs. Energy-efficient mortgage (EEM) Making green upgrades can be costly, but you can get an energy-efficient mortgage (EEM) (either a conventional loan or one backed by the FHA or VA) to help finance them. This type of mortgage allows you to tack the cost of energy-efficient upgrades (think new insulation, a more efficient HVAC system or double-pane windows) onto your primary loan, without requiring a larger down payment. However, EEMs come with larger mortgage payments (since you’re borrowing more), and there are certain requirements, including an energy assessment. Those larger payments might be worth it, though, as you could wind up saving on your utility bills in the long run. Native American Direct Loan (NADL) and Section 184 program The Native American Direct Loan (NADL), guaranteed by the VA, and Section 184 loan, guaranteed by HUD, provide financing to eligible Native American homebuyers. A Section 184 loan requires just 2.25 percent down. The NADL program has no down payment requirement, but is only for Native American veterans and their spouses. First-time homebuyer programs by state Each U.S. state operates a housing finance authority (HFA) that serves to encourage homeownership, among other responsibilities. Here are these HFAs and other first-time buyer resources by region: Midwest Caret Down Housing finance agency Mortgage lenders Illinois Housing Development Authority Illinois mortgage lenders Indiana Housing & Community Development Authority Indiana mortgage lenders Iowa Finance Authority Iowa mortgage lenders Kansas Housing Resources Corporation Kansas mortgage lenders Michigan State Housing Development Authority Michigan mortgage lenders Minnesota Housing Finance Agency Minnesota mortgage lenders Missouri Housing Development Commission Missouri mortgage lenders Nebraska Investment Finance Authority Nebraska mortgage lenders North Dakota Housing Finance Agency North Dakota mortgage lenders Ohio Housing Finance Agency Ohio mortgage lenders South Dakota Housing Development Authority South Dakota mortgage lenders Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority Wisconsin mortgage lenders Northeast Caret Down Housing finance agency Mortgage lenders Connecticut Housing Finance Authority Connecticut mortgage lenders Maine State Housing Authority Maine mortgage lenders Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development Massachusetts mortgage lenders New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority New Hampshire mortgage lenders New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency New Jersey mortgage lenders State of New York Mortgage Agency New York mortgage lenders Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency Pennsylvania mortgage lenders Rhode Island Housing Rhode Island mortgage lenders Vermont Housing Finance Agency Vermont mortgage lenders South Caret Down Housing finance agency Mortgage lenders Alabama Housing Finance Authority Alabama mortgage lenders Arkansas Development Finance Authority Arkansas mortgage lenders Delaware State Housing Authority Delaware mortgage lenders Florida Housing Finance Corporation Florida mortgage lenders Georgia Department of Community Affairs Georgia mortgage lenders Kentucky Housing Corporation Kentucky mortgage lenders Louisiana Housing Corporation Louisiana mortgage lenders Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development Maryland mortgage lenders Mississippi Home Corporation Mississippi mortgage lenders North Carolina Housing Finance Agency North Carolina mortgage lenders Oklahoma Housing Finance Agency Oklahoma mortgage lenders South Carolina State Housing Finance & Development Authority South Carolina mortgage lenders Tennessee Housing Development Agency Tennessee mortgage lenders Texas first-time homebuyer programsTexas Department of Housing and Community Affairs Texas mortgage lenders Virginia Housing Virginia mortgage lenders District of Columbia Housing Finance Agency Washington, D.C. mortgage lenders West Virginia Housing Development Fund West Virginia mortgage lenders West Caret Down Housing finance agency Mortgage lenders Alaska Housing Finance Corporation Alaska mortgage lenders Arizona Industrial Development Authority Arizona mortgage lenders California Housing Finance Agency California mortgage lenders Colorado Housing and Finance Authority Colorado mortgage lenders Hawaii Housing Finance & Development Corporation Hawaii mortgage lenders Idaho Housing and Finance Association Idaho mortgage lenders Montana Housing Montana mortgage lenders Nevada Housing Division Nevada mortgage lenders New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority New Mexico mortgage lenders Oregon Housing and Community Services Oregon mortgage lenders Utah Housing Corporation Utah mortgage lenders Washington State Housing Finance Commission Washington mortgage lenders Wyoming Community Development Authority Wyoming mortgage lenders Nonprofit programs Nonprofit program options tend to be reserved for first-time homebuyers with incomes that are significantly lower than the median income in their area, or buyers who fit certain demographic or other criteria. Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America The Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA) is a nonprofit that provides low-rate mortgages to low- and moderate-income borrowers without requiring a down payment or closing costs or any mortgage insurance. The nonprofit doesn’t use credit scores to qualify you, either: Instead, it looks at other factors such as rent payment history. Habitat for Humanity If your annual income is 60 percent or less of the median income in your area, you might qualify for Habitat for Humanity’s homeownership program. Along with not exceeding the income threshold, you’ll need to contribute sweat equity​​ — in other words, help build the home or a home for another applicant — to qualify. Employer-sponsored programs Employer-assisted housing (EAH) programs help employees with housing needs, usually in neighborhoods near the workplace. This assistance can come in many forms, such as a forgivable loan coupled with required homeownership education. EAH programs are often limited to certain occupations, and there could be other restrictions, such as a first-time homebuyer or specific tenure requirement, or income limits. First-time homebuyer programs for students If you recently graduated from college, you might be eligible for help buying your first home. For example, the state of Ohio offers a Grants for Grads program with up to 5 percent down payment assistance for anyone who finished an academic program in the last 48 months. These programs typically come with a requirement to stay put for a given time (in Ohio, it’s five years), or else you’ll need to repay the funds. How to apply for a first-time homebuyer loan or program Your mortgage lender can help you determine whether you qualify for a first-time homebuyer program, as well as apply for one if you do. You can also check out your state’s housing finance agency (HFA) website to learn eligibility criteria and take next steps to apply. There will be forms to fill out, but the payoff can make the investment well worth the time. First-time homebuyer FAQ Who qualifies for first-time homebuyer programs? Caret Down A first-time homebuyer refers to a homebuyer who hasn’t owned a home previously. However, in terms of qualifying for a first-time buyer program, it often doesn’t have to be your very first time. Many programs define “first-time homebuyer” as a buyer who hasn’t owned a home within the past three years. Depending on the program, the qualifications might also include not exceeding a certain income or buying a home above a specific price point. Which loan is best for first-time homebuyers? Caret Down The best type of mortgage for a first-time homebuyer (or any borrower) is one that’s affordable. This might mean a loan that has a lower interest rate, lower down payment requirement, low or no mortgage insurance and other ways to save.That said, many first-time buyers go with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage because the monthly payments are lower and more predictable. Two popular 30-year fixed-rate choices: conventional loans and FHA loans. What are first-time homebuyer education programs? Caret Down First-time homebuyer education programs are designed to help you understand the various aspects of owning a home. To qualify for many first-time buyer loan programs, you’ll need to take a course. If you’re obtaining a conventional loan, you might be able to take the Fannie Mae HomeView online class to satisfy this requirement. Check with your loan officer to learn your options.",https://www.bankrate.com/2022/11/24150158/First-time-homebuyer-loans-and-programs.jpg,2024-04-16,-0.062,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Low',

"Loan buybacks haven’t disappeared, but they are trending down - HousingWire","Loan buybacks haven’t disappeared, but they are trending down  HousingWire","Thu, 18 Apr 2024 15:57:30 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sb2FuLWJ1eWJhY2tzLWhhdmVudC1kaXNhcHBlYXJlZC1idXQtdGhleS1hcmUtdHJlbmRpbmctZG93bi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"As of third-quarter 2023, the most recent data available, Freddie Mac’s repurchase volume was $384 million, with Fannie Mae’s volume at $382 million. The report notes, however, that “in Q3 2023, Freddie repurchases fell 35% from the prior quarter while Fannie’s fell only 12%.” Brett Ludden is managing director and co-head of the financial services team at Sterling Point Advisors, a merger and acquisitions advisory firm. He is also the co-founder and managing partner of Augment Analytics. “We’re seeing a downward trend in total [loans] repurchased [on a dollar basis], and that’s true for both Fannie and Freddie,” Ludden said. “I anticipate that trend continues for both. “… But the data [for Q3 2023] indicate that Freddie’s repurchase rates are going down at a much faster pace [than Fannie’s]. … We’ll get more definitive data when we get the fourth-quarter results to see if the trends continue at that point.” A report from the Urban Institute focused on Fannie and Freddie loan repurchase rates shows that the GSEs in recent years “have become more aggressive, forcing more repurchases earlier in the life of the loan than was the case in earlier vintages.” The Urban Institute report, published in November 2023, shows that the average number of months from origination to repurchase between 2005 to 2008 (prior to and during the early stages of the global financial crisis) was 46 months for Freddie Mac and 52 months for Fannie Mae. From 2018 through Q1 2023, however, that same figure was 11 months for Freddie and 13 months for Fannie. Policing loans Even as the agencies have become more aggressive in loan repurchases in the past several years, particularly in the wake of record origination volumes in 2020 and 2021, data seems to indicate that lenders have also become more vigilant in policing loan originations to ensure quality control (QC). ACES Quality Management, a fintech that provides quality-control software for the financial services industry, issued a Mortgage QC Industry Trends report with data through Q3 2023. The report provides a quarter-by-quarter critical-defect rate for mortgages (primarily Fannie, Freddie and Federal Housing Administration loans) that were analyzed via its software. According to the ACES report, the critical-defect rate declined from 2.47% in third-quarter 2022 to 1.67% in Q3 2023, the most recent data available. The report defines a critical defect as one that “would result in the loan being uninsurable or ineligible for sale.” One of the QC efforts now underway to stem agency loan repurchase demands was launched by Fannie Mae this past September. It mandates, among other measures, that companies that sell loans to the agency must complete monthly prefunding reviews on either 10% of its prior month’s loan originations or 750 loans, whichever is less. Because loan repurchase data from the GSEs is only current through the third quarter of 2023, it’s still too early to tell if Fannie Mae’s program will have a material impact on its repurchase demands. “Repurchases have been a hot topic for lenders, and to some degree, the agencies and investors have gotten a bad rap in these discussions,” said Nick Volpe, executive vice president of ACES Quality Management. “It makes sense that the investors are asking lenders to ward off as many problems as possible [via QC efforts] before a loan is made. “The overarching goal of prefunding QC is to ward off problems before they become issues on closed loans. The problem obviously is bad loans that lead to repurchase and indemnification.” Non-QM vigilance Pamela Hamrick, president of Incenter Diligence Solutions, which provides due-diligence reviews and document management services for the mortgage industry, said that prefunding reviews are also gaining more traction in the nonqualified mortgage (non-QM) space. Non-QM loans are those that cannot be purchased by the GSEs. The pool of non-QM borrowers includes real estate investors, foreign nationals, business owners, gig workers and the self-employed, as well as a smaller group of homebuyers who face credit challenges, such as past bankruptcies. “There are a lot more of the non-QM and DSCR (debt-service-coverage ratio) loans than there have been in the past,” Hamrick said. “And those loans are historically riskier than a typical conventional loan.” She added that a growing share of non-QM lenders are starting to “embrace more QC prefunding eligibility reviews … because they have major concerns about liquidity in the secondary market for their non-QM and DSCR loans.” “If a lender closes a loan and a mistake is discovered, it’s likely that their loan won’t get purchased,” Hamrick explained. “So, having a prefunding eligibility review better ensures that the loan transaction can be problem free.” John Levonick is a senior partner with the law firm Garris Horn LLP, which serves mortgage companies, secondary market investors, quality control firms, third-party review firms and others in the financial services space. He also previously served as CEO of Canopy, a third-party review firm. Levonick said that in today’s market, the economics have shifted toward encouraging more quality control reviews at the originator level. “The presumption is that the investors give better pricing for the loans if they have been [run through a quality control review] by the originator,” he added. “And when that happens, the investor will purchase the loans and also purchase the rights to the due diligence through what’s called a reliance letter, which permits the investor to rely on the work done for the lender as if it was done for the investor [satisfying regulator and rating agency requirements]. “So, the lender, regardless of size, has to come out of pocket and pay for the due diligence, but then they allegedly recapture that cost through better execution [of the loan sale to the end investor].” A&D Mortgage is one example of an originator that is committed to prefunding quality control reviews. Alexander Suslov, the company’s head of capital markets, said that originators perform prefunding reviews on 100% of A&D’s overall loan production, including its non-QM originations. “Because we do 100% of the prefunding review, we didn’t have that many loan repurchases for it to be super alerting,” Suslov said. “With the little increase that we had, it simply alerted us that we need to be more careful [in certain areas].” Future technology Alan Qureshi, managing partner of Blue Water Financial Technologies — a technology solutions provider for the secondary mortgage market that also offers risk management services — said he holds out great hope for the future of tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and digital quality control reviews in helping to level the playing field in the mortgage market, including on the loan repurchase front. “Because of the nature of buybacks and because of the non-standardization of loan delivery, I have a fundamental problem around counterparty selection in a market where the big get bigger and the small, well, they get cast aside, but that’s not good for the consumer,” Qureshi said. “The flip side is if I instead have a platform that leverages technology (such as AI and optical character recognition software, or OCR) to essentially level the playing field. That’s a much better outcome and solution for the industry.” Verus Mortgage Capital is an aggregator and affiliate of asset manager and investment adviser Invictus Capital Partners, which sponsors a nonagency securitization platform. Verus has acquired more than $30 billion in residential loans and completed 58 securitizations since its inception, according to Dane Smith, Verus’ senior managing director and president. “There’s a lot of stakeholders throughout the mortgage ecosystem, and due diligence is kind of the common thread that allows … [loan] documents [assembled in a PDF file] to be turned into an institutional-quality asset,” Smith said. In a business that is inherently high volume and high stakes, Smith also said advances in technology — including on the AI and OCR front — promise to create even greater efficiencies and accuracy in the system at all levels. He stresses, however, that the industry is still a long way from removing all human touch and judgment from the quality control process, which is essentially the bond of trust holding the system together. “We buy loans from over 100 different mortgage banks in a given month,” Smith said, “… and we’ve been working with and training a [generative AI] system on our [non-QM] guidelines.” He stressed that the AI system is still in development and not in general use at this point. “We’ve been training it just so you can ask a question, and it can give you the various guidelines in response,” Smith explained. “So, we’re much closer [to AI underwriting in the non-QM space], but I still think there’s still a pretty decent ways to go before you could upload all the mortgage docs, and it can understand what type of loan it is, or it could understand and underwrite the loan, and it could bump it up against guidelines. “ …There’s lots of ways we can use AI to increase productivity. Unfortunately, we’re still a ways from decisioning and underwriting and QC.“",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AdobeStock_396094113.jpeg,2024-04-18,-0.291,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Dane Smith', 'description': 'Canadian basketball player', 'full_name': 'Dane Smith'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Freddie', 'latitude': -22.642780303955078, 'longitude': 28.804519653320312, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sterling', 'latitude': 39.006221771240234, 'longitude': -77.42859649658203, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ludden', 'latitude': 46.00917053222656, 'longitude': -98.12667083740234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Institute', 'latitude': 35.35765838623047, 'longitude': -77.71385955810547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ACES', 'latitude': 43.43333053588867, 'longitude': -6.066669940948486, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hamrick', 'latitude': 35.80984115600586, 'longitude': -82.19901275634766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Garris', 'latitude': 43.343299865722656, 'longitude': -1.059999942779541, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Suslov', 'latitude': 58.56639862060547, 'longitude': 70.14450073242188, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Qureshi', 'latitude': 28.258670806884766, 'longitude': 68.93536376953125, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Smith', 'latitude': 39.32038116455078, 'longitude': -77.27220916748047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Fannie Mae's repurchase volume was $382 million in Q3 2023, a 12% decrease from the previous quarter.

FHFA annual report highlights GSE actions on affordable housing - HousingWire,FHFA annual report highlights GSE actions on affordable housing  HousingWire,"Thu, 18 Apr 2024 17:57:33 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9maGZhLWFubnVhbC1yZXBvcnQtaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy1nc2UtYWN0aW9ucy1vbi1hZmZvcmRhYmxlLWhvdXNpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) this week released its annual Housing Mission Report, offering insights into the actions the agency took in 2023 on a host of issues. These include oversight of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, mortgage purchases designed to improve affordability for low-income homeowners, vendor partnerships and investments in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. All told, the GSEs purchased more than 136,000 single-family mortgages to low- and moderate-income homebuyers last year through the HomeReady and Home Possible programs. They also added “enhancements” to the programs themselves, including the addition of “a credit of $2,500 for very low-income borrowers that lenders must pass through to borrowers by applying it to the down payment or closing costs,” the report stated. The GSEs also purchased 15,000 Special Purpose Credit Program (SPCP) loans “through both lender-sponsored initiatives and their proprietary SPCPs.” These are designed to support homeownership efforts for borrowers in underserved communities. Through the HomeReady First SPCP, Fannie Mae acquired 921 loans with a total of more than $5 million in down payment or closing cost assistance, the report stated. Seventy-nine percent of participating borrowers self-identified as “members of historically underserved groups.” Fannie also purchased 4,747 loans through lender-sponsored SPCPs in which 81% of borrowers self-identified as part of such groups. Freddie Mac’s BorrowSmart Access SPCP saw the acquisition of 2,462 loans “with close to $4 million in down payment or closing cost assistance,” according to the report. The GSE also purchased 6,828 loans originated through lender-sponsored SPCPs. More than half (57%) of these loans were “obtained by underserved borrowers.” Nearly 9,300 households took advantage of either Freddie Mac’s program or its support for lender-sponsored SPCPs. Stemming from its equitable housing finance plans, FHFA also oversaw the GSEs’ partnerships with certain vendors to make more rent-payment data available to credit bureaus from participating multifamily housing property owners. Rent payment data gives renters a more efficient avenue to either establish or strengthen their credit profiles. Nearly 3,000 multifamily properties were added last year to the GSEs’ programs. Through Fannie Mae, 27,845 renters established credit profiles while 117,182 renters strengthened their existing profiles. Freddie Mac had 55,300 renters establish profiles and 304,194 strengthen them, according to the report. The GSEs also “invested over $1.7 billion last year in [LIHTC] equity, including transactions that support housing in Duty to Serve-designated rural areas, preserve affordable housing, support mixed-income housing, provide supportive housing, or meet other affordable housing objectives.” More than 90% of these LIHTC investments by the GSEs, or some $1.6 billion, were made in “targeted transactions,” meaning they were investments that either support housing in Duty to Serve-designated rural areas or “meet other affordable housing objectives defined by FHFA,” the report explained. “FHFA maintains a keen focus on ensuring the entities we regulate fulfill their missions to support access to housing opportunities in a safe and sound manner,” FHFA Director Sandra Thompson said in an announcement of the report. “Ongoing affordability challenges throughout the country only heighten the importance of this responsibility.”",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AdobeStock_301407574_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg,2024-04-18,0.116,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Low', 'latitude': 53.00667190551758, 'longitude': -0.9980599880218506, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Duty', 'latitude': 19.649999618530273, 'longitude': -72.30000305175781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Fannie Mae purchased over 136,000 mortgages for low- and moderate-income homebuyers through HomeReady and Home Possible programs, adding enhancements like a $2,500 credit for very low-income borrowers.

Mortgage Lenders View TSPs as Indispensable (but Expensive) Partners - Fannie Mae,Mortgage Lenders View TSPs as Indispensable (but Expensive) Partners  Fannie Mae,"Thu, 18 Apr 2024 13:59:17 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhbm5pZW1hZS5jb20vcmVzZWFyY2gtYW5kLWluc2lnaHRzL3BlcnNwZWN0aXZlcy9tb3J0Z2FnZS1sZW5kZXJzLXZpZXctdHNwcy1pbmRpc3BlbnNhYmxlLWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1wYXJ0bmVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fannie Mae,"Over the past decade, as mortgage-related services have increasingly moved toward digitalization, Technology Service Providers (TSPs) have become an essential part of lenders' day-to-day operations. Mortgage lenders leverage TSP technology offerings to help improve loan quality, reduce origination cycle time, and drive a better customer experience, among other benefits. Earlier this year, Fannie Mae's Economic and Strategic Research (ESR) Group surveyed nearly 200 senior mortgage executives to better understand how they feel about the TSP marketplace, as well as their experiences with the various services offered. Our survey considered solutions and applications spanning the entire mortgage lending life cycle, including those related to point of sale (POS) systems, borrower credit reporting, verification of borrower income / employment / assets (VOI/E/A), loan origination systems (LOS), appraisals, closing, servicing, compliance, and business analytics. Among the key findings: When selecting TSPs, lenders cited cost considerations, functionality, and integration capabilities as the most important criteria. These criteria were also the top three listed in 2016, when we last surveyed lenders on this topic. This time around, however, cost considerations leapfrogged the others to become the most important criterion; in 2016, integration was cited as most important. TSP technology offerings for LOS and POS solutions are considered by most lenders as business critical (or ""must haves""). Given their criticality, LOS and POS solutions also ranked highest in terms of total TSP investment, which includes headcount and/or budget invested toward implementation and usage. The majority of respondents reported that the value they receive from their LOS TSP investments matches or exceeds their expectations, but many believe that there are too few competitors in this space. By contrast, lenders see the investment returns on VOI/E/A and credit reporting TSP solutions as delivering the least value relative to expectations. Here, too, many respondents believe there to be a lack of competitive offerings. Click image above for larger view As part of the survey, we also encouraged lenders to share their thoughts about the TSP marketplace generally and the value of their investments. In their comments, lenders expressed particular frustration with the rising cost of TSP solutions, which many believe is driven by a lack of competition. This frustration was most prevalent among TSP solutions focused on LOS, borrower credit reporting, and borrower VOI/E/A. Some lenders pointed out that the costs in these areas have climbed and continue to rise, leading to significantly increased loan origination costs and, because these expenses are sometimes passed through to consumers, higher borrower closing costs. Click image above for larger view Mortgage lenders face tremendous cost pressures in today's higher rate, lower volume business environment. Many of the lenders surveyed mentioned that they would like to see more competition in the TSP marketplace to help alleviate some of these costs, but they also acknowledged that the barriers to entry in the technology space are often high. Additionally, respondents noted that new entrants' functionalities might be limited, and the up-front integration challenges, which are typically costly, could discourage many lenders from even considering new providers. Furthermore, even for the functional areas in which lenders believe there is ample competition, some commented that they lack the bandwidth to research new options. In the end, while the mortgage lending community views TSPs as indispensable partners, the rising costs required to implement, maintain, and use their services is top of mind for many lenders.

The data, contained in Fannie Mae’s latest Home Price Index, shows that’s up from the previous quarter’s revised annual growth rate of 6.6%. “Home prices continued to rise in the first quarter as the housing market remained seriously supply constrained,” said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. “The stabilization of mortgage rates in the 6.6% to 6.7% range in January helped to boost demand early in the first quarter, with existing home sales and mortgage applications both rising. Mortgage rates have trended upward again of late, but there is support for home prices in strong demographic demand from younger generations. We expect home sales to rise modestly this year as potential homebuyers appear to be acclimating to the higher-rate environment and, in some cases, may be less able to put off moving for life reasons.” On a quarterly basis, home prices were up a seasonally adjusted 1.7%. That’s flat from the growth reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. And, looking on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, home prices were also up 1.7% in the first quarter.

When Will Mortgage Rates Go Down to 3%? - Norada Real Estate Investments,When Will Mortgage Rates Go Down to 3%?

The answer is not anytime soon, according to most experts and forecasts. In fact, mortgage rates are expected to stay above 6% for most of 2024, and only gradually decline by the end of the year. Mortgage Rates and Influencing Factors Mortgage rates are influenced by many factors, such as the supply and demand for housing, the economic growth, the inflation, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, and the global market conditions. In 2023, mortgage rates soared to their highest levels in decades, as the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate six times to combat rising inflation and overheating economy. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate reached 8.45% in October 2023, considered to be the highest level for 30-year rates since 2000. Thereafter, in less than two months since October's historic high-water mark, 30-year mortgage rates dropped back down to about 7%. Now, the Fed has paused its rate hikes, as inflation has started to moderate and economic growth has slowed down. The Fed also signaled that it expects to cut its interest rate three times in 2024, as it sees a more balanced outlook for the economy. This has led to a drop in mortgage rates, which fell to 6.60% in January 2024. But don't expect mortgage rates to fall much further in the near future. Most forecasts agree that mortgage rates will remain above 7% for most of 2024, as the Fed will still be cautious about cutting rates too quickly or too deeply. Projections from Different Sources Goldman Sachs Research: The analysts expect the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to be 7.6% at the end of 2023, and 7.1% at the end of 2024. Forbes Advisor: The experts predict that mortgage rates will average 7.5% in the first quarter of 2024, dropping to 6.9% in the second quarter, and falling to 6.5% by the end of the year. U.S. News: The publication forecasts that mortgage rates will continue to fall to 6.3% by the end of 2024. Mortgage Bankers Association: The trade group projects that mortgage rates will slide to 6.1% by the end of 2024. Fannie Mae: The government-sponsored enterprise expects that mortgage rates will dip to 6.5% by the end of 2024. Bright MLS: The real estate listing service anticipates that mortgage rates will decline to 6.2% by the end of 2024. As you can see, none of these forecasts expect mortgage rates to go down to 3% in 2024. In fact, that level of mortgage rates has not been seen since early 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a historic plunge in interest rates and a surge in refinancing activity. Implications for Homebuyers and Homeowners So what does this mean for you as a homebuyer or homeowner? It means that you should not wait for mortgage rates to drop significantly before making your move. If you are ready to buy a home or refinance your existing mortgage, you should act sooner rather than later, as mortgage rates are still relatively low compared to historical averages. You should also shop around for the best mortgage rate and terms for your situation, as different lenders may offer different deals. Mortgage rates are unpredictable and can change quickly depending on various factors. Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the market trends and news, and consult with a trusted mortgage professional who can help you navigate the process and find the best option for you.",https://www.noradarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/when-will-mortgage-rates-go-down-to-3.jpeg,2024-04-19,-0.447,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Forbes', 'latitude': 45.943580627441406, 'longitude': -98.78205108642578, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not directly related,"Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored enterprise, forecasts that mortgage rates will dip to 6.5% by the end of 2024.

"Home Sales Tumble, But There's Hope for a Turnaround - National Association of REALTORS®","Home Sales Tumble, But There's Hope for a Turnaround  National Association of REALTORS®","Thu, 18 Apr 2024 17:46:12 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hci5yZWFsdG9yL21hZ2F6aW5lL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLW5ld3MvaG9tZS1zYWxlcy10dW1ibGUtYnV0LXRoZXJlcy1ob3BlLWZvci1hLXR1cm5hcm91bmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,National Association of REALTORS®,"The spring housing market is off to a sluggish start, with home sales falling in March. Economists say a resurgence in mortgage rates and inflation could be softening sales at the start of what is traditionally real estate’s busiest season. Despite the headwinds, sellers continue to see home prices grow, buyers’ appetite for housing remains high and bidding wars are still occurring. On top of that, a growing job market may offer some rosier prospects for more sales. Existing-home sales dropped 4.3% in March compared to the previous month and are nearly 4% lower than a year ago, the National Association of REALTORS® reported Thursday. While more listings came on the market last month, the increased competition among sellers didn’t appear to hurt home prices. The median existing-home sales price increased 4.8%, reaching $393,500—the highest price ever recorded for March, NAR reports. Meanwhile, builders pressed the brakes on new-home construction, sensing buyer hesitancy from rising mortgage rates. Builders also reported facing higher construction costs and tighter lending conditions last month. The Commerce Department reported this week that permits for single-family housing starts dropped to a five-month low, indicating a slowdown in future construction as well. Spring Thaw? Nevertheless, homebuying and selling sentiment remains strong, according to Fannie Mae’s latest Home Purchase Sentiment Index. “Both our ‘good time to buy’ and ‘good time to sell’ measures continued their slow upward drift this month,” says Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae’s chief economist. “However, consumers took a slightly more pessimistic view on the likely direction of mortgage rates, reflecting the fact that actual mortgage rates have moved upward since the start of the year. With the historically low rates of the pandemic era now firmly behind us, some households appear to be moving past the hurdle of last year’s sharp jump in rates, an adjustment that we think could help further thaw the housing market.” Fannie Mae predicts a gradual increase in sales transactions and home listings this year. Indeed, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun notes there are nearly 6 million more jobs compared to pre-COVID highs. That “suggests more aspiring home buyers exist in the market,” he says. Latest Housing Data Existing home sales fell in March in the Midwest, South and West but rose in the Northeast for the first time in about four months. Here’s a closer look at key housing indicators from NAR’s latest report: Housing inventories are rising: Total housing inventory was up nearly 5% compared to February and up 14.4% from a year ago. “More inventory is always welcomed in the current environment,” Yun says. “Frankly, it’s a great time to list, with ongoing multiple offers on mid-priced properties and, overall, home prices continuing to rise.” Home prices climb: The median existing-home price for all housing types was $393,500, up 4.8% compared to a year earlier. All four major regions of the U.S. posted price gains last month, led by the Northeast and Midwest. Days on the market up slightly from a year ago: Properties typically remained on the market for 33 days. That is a quicker pace than the 38 days recorded in February but is up from 29 days a year ago. First-time buyers are increasing: The share of sales to first-time home buyers grew to 32%, up from 26% in February and 28% from a year earlier. All-cash sales still remain high: All-cash sales comprised 28% of transactions, down from 33% in February but up from 27% a year earlier. Individual investors and second-home buyers tend to make up the biggest bulk of all-cash sales. They accounted for 15% of sales, up slightly from 17% a year ago. Regional Breakdown Here’s a closer look at how home sales fared across the country in March, according to NAR’s report: Northeast: Existing-home sales rose 4.2%, reaching an annual rate of 500,000. Home sales are down 3.8% from a year ago. Median price: $434,600, up 9.9% from one year ago. Midwest: Sales dropped 1.9% compared to a month ago, reaching an annual rate of 1.01 million. Sales are down 1% from the prior year. Median price: $292,400, up 7.5% from March 2023. South: Sales fell 5.9% compared to February, settling in at an annual rate of 1.9 million. Sales are 5% lower than a year earlier. Median price: $359,100, up 3.4% from last year. West: Sales decreased 8.2% from a month ago, reaching an annual rate of 780,000.

Newly introduced enhancements to these programs included the addition of a $2,500 credit to assist very low-income borrowers with down payments and closing costs.

On a quarterly basis, home prices rose a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent in Q1 2024, essentially the same as the growth in Q4 2023. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, home prices also increased by 1.7 percent in Q1 2024. ""Home prices continued to rise in the first quarter as the housing market remained seriously supply constrained,"" said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. ""The stabilization of mortgage rates in the 6.6 to 6.7 percent range in January helped to boost demand early in the first quarter, with existing home sales and mortgage applications both rising. Mortgage rates have trended upward again of late, but there is support for home prices in strong demographic demand from younger generations. We expect home sales to rise modestly this year as potential homebuyers appear to be acclimating to the higher-rate environment and, in some cases, may be less able to put off moving for life reasons."" The FNM-HPI is produced by aggregating county-level data to create both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted national indices that are representative of the whole country and designed to serve as indicators of general single-family home price trends. The FNM-HPI is publicly available at the national level as a quarterly series with a start date of Q1 1975 and extending to the most recent quarter, Q1 2024. Fannie Mae publishes the FNM-HPI approximately mid-month during the first month of each new quarter.

McCargo, who was sworn in as the 18th president of Ginnie Mae in December 2021, will step down from her post on May 3. She is notable for being the first woman and the first woman of color to head Ginnie Mae, or officially, the Government National Mortgage Association. Before being nominated by President Joe Biden to helm Ginnie, McCargo had served in the administration since January 2021, appointed as a senior advisor for housing finance for Marcia Fudge, then secretary of HUD. Her career in housing started long before her entry into HUD; prior to her appointment, she was vice president of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, focused on narrowing the racial homeownership gap and eliminating barriers to minority credit access. She also held leadership roles at the Mortgage Servicing Collaborative, CoreLogic, and JP Morgan Chase, and worked for a decade at Fannie Mae on secondary mortgage market and policy development. “The past 3.5 years in public service with the Biden-Harris administration has been the most important and fulfilling work of my 25-year career in housing finance, and I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve my country and advance a bold housing agenda across the globe as president of Ginnie Mae,” McCargo said in a statement. “I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished together and grateful for the housing leadership this Administration and agency have demonstrated since our first day in office. “This has been a deeply personal decision to return to private life,” McCargo concluded. Acting HUD Secretary Adrianne Todman, who replaced Fudge upon her resignation earlier this year, thanked McCargo for her service. “In her time at the agency, she has been a zealous advocate for housing affordability and ensuring a more equitable housing finance system,” Todman said. “As President of Ginnie Mae, Alanna has helped expand Ginnie Mae’s reach in serving historically underserved communities and has been a champion for advancing market-driven initiatives that support mortgage programs across the government. “It has been a joy to work with President McCargo. I am proud to say that she has left Ginnie Mae stronger than when she arrived, and her tenure sets a high standard for servant leadership.” Bob Broeksmit, president and CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), likewise offered his gratitude for McCargo’s leadership, highlighting her work on affordable housing initiatives and improving the function of capital markets during her tenure. “We commend President McCargo and her staff for their contributions on numerous issues, including supporting mortgage servicers in their commitment to helping struggling homeowners enter and exit COVID-19 forbearance programs, investing in technology to improve the experience for issuers, and enhancing liquidity for Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities,” he said.",https://www.scotsmanguide.com/files/sites/2/2023/01/f0b643ab_ginniemaelogo.jpg,2024-04-19,0.433,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'HUD', 'latitude': 53.64799880981445, 'longitude': -1.784999966621399, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 39.608978271484375, 'longitude': -78.94029998779297, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Institute', 'latitude': 35.35765838623047, 'longitude': -77.71385955810547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Biden', 'latitude': 5.229050159454346, 'longitude': -1.0081199407577515, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Harris', 'latitude': -40.76667022705078, 'longitude': 175.5500030517578, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Administration', 'latitude': 32.22787857055664, 'longitude': 35.22243118286133, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'President', 'latitude': 42.50199890136719, 'longitude': 1.5119999647140503, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Alanna', 'latitude': 13.266670227050781, 'longitude': 25.549999237060547, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MBA', 'latitude': -1.6971800327301025, 'longitude': 37.618080139160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

She was an incredible woman with a uniquely wonderful way of touching the lives of everyone she met. If you knew her, you were blessed. She was a strong Southern woman, the bless your heart kind, who could do it all; family, career, and home while still serving the community with her huge servant’s heart. She was a devoted wife, mother, daughter, and friend, who also influenced many young people in her 33 years as an educator. She was born to Theodore Solomon and Fannie Mae Solomon on July 5th, 1937, and spent her youth in Wilmington and Kannapolis. She met her true love, Murphy Osborne, at High Point College and they married. Janice and Murphy shared a wonderful life together full of family, friends, travel, and faithful devotion not only to each other but also to their faith. Their love for each other was immeasurable and they faced the joys and the challenges of their lives hand in hand. They were married for more than 67 years and never tired of sharing each other’s company. They completed each other. To her daughters, Janice was the perfect example of a Christian servant, showing them how to be women of character, faith, and strength by example. To her grandsons, she was magical! To her friends, she was loyal and helped share the burdens and joys of life. To her students, she was the favorite teacher, leaving an impression far beyond what she taught them academically. If you were one of her “projects”, you were blessed immensely. She was involved with many organizations, often in a leadership role but some of her happiest memories were the years spent as the Co-Chairman of the First Baptist Church Clothing Ministry, where she touched many lives with her compassion, serving as the hands and feet of Jesus Christ for more than 30 years. She will be truly missed by everyone she loved and served. Janice is survived by her devoted husband, Dr. Murphy M. Osborne, Jr.; daughters, Cindy Jones (Skip) and Lisa Blackwood (Geary); grandsons, Street Jones (Ashton), Blake Painter, Liam McGeever, Daniel McGeever: brother Ted Solomon (Melanie); great grandchildren, E Jones and Wells Jones; sister-in-law Jean Wheeling: lifelong friend, Lorraine Griffin. Janice was predeceased by her father, Theodore Solomon; her mother, Fannie Mae Solomon; her brother, Ed Solomon; her stepmother, Lucille Solomon. The family would like to thank the Springmoor staff and Hospice for the loving and tender care that was given to her.

Fannie & Freddie stock double after election Two stocks that have surged on the Trump rally are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Shares of the housing government sponsored enterprises, which buy and package mortgages, have nearly doubled in price over the last two weeks on expectations that Trump will be favorable to investors. One of those investors is Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, which purchased a sizable stake in 2013, making the hedge fund mogul the largest shareholder in both companies. Instagram targets Snapchat with disappearing photos, live video Turning to the world of social media, Instagram is trying to turn up the heat on Snapchat. Instagram, owned by Facebook, announcing it will offer live video streaming, as well as video and photos that disappear. And yes, disappearing media is what helped make Snapchat a huge success, with more than 150 million daily users. But no, Snapchat does not have live video—at least not yet.

Decisions on interest rates, influenced by economic data and inflation targets, directly impact the cost of borrowing. The Fed's signaled interest rate cuts could lead to a decrease in mortgage rates, fostering a more favorable borrowing environment. Inflation: Inflation remains one of the most significant factors affecting mortgage rates. Efforts to curb inflation could result in adjustments to interest rates, with higher inflation typically leading to higher mortgage rates to counteract the economy's overheating. Economic Growth: The overall health of the economy plays a crucial role. Strong economic indicators might push rates up as demand for credit increases, while signs of a slowdown could lead to decreases in an effort to stimulate borrowing and investment. Housing Market Dynamics: The balance of supply and demand in the housing market will also impact rates. A surplus of homes could lead to lower rates to encourage buying, whereas a shortage might drive rates up as competition for available homes increases. Global Events: International events, such as geopolitical conflicts or global economic downturns, can affect investor confidence and lead to fluctuations in mortgage rates as investors seek safer assets like U.S. Treasury bonds, influencing yields and borrowing costs. Government Policies: Fiscal policies, including tax laws and housing regulations, can influence mortgage rates. For example, policies that stimulate housing construction can increase supply, potentially leading to lower mortgage rates. Consumer Behavior: The demand for mortgages is also shaped by consumer confidence and demographic trends. Changes in homebuyer preferences or shifts in population growth can affect the demand for mortgages and, consequently, the rates. Bond Market Movements: Mortgage rates are closely tied to the bond market, particularly the 10-year Treasury yield. As investors' perceptions of risk change, so do bond yields, which can lead to corresponding changes in mortgage rates. Banking Sector Health: The financial stability and lending practices of banks can influence mortgage rates. A robust banking sector may offer more competitive rates, while a struggling one might tighten lending and increase rates. Technological Advancements: The rise of fintech and online lending platforms has introduced more competition into the mortgage industry, which could lead to more favorable rates for consumers as companies vie for business.",https://www.noradarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mortgage-rate-predictions-for-next-2-years.jpeg,2024-04-20,0.085,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S. Treasury', 'latitude': 33.32728958129883, 'longitude': -107.71475982666016, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

A Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that a mere 55% of adults say buying a home is the best investment families can make. That's down from 59% last November, 67% last May and 79% in June 2008. A similar question on a Fannie Mae's National Housing survey found that in 1996, a whopping 89% of Americans believed one was better off owning a home rather than renting. The new skeptics include folks like Dave Guilford, a former stockbroker and small business owner who, in November 2008, sold his Mandeville, La. home for $220,000 and put his stake in a 4-bedroom Paris rental. ""If it's up to me, we'll never own another home again, unless it's investment property and not our own residence,"" he says. ""I'm perfectly content to rent for the rest of my life."" Guilford, 40, managed to scrape some equity out of the home, which he bought for $180,000 in 2003. But he thinks he would've gotten a better return if he had put the money into stocks or a retirement savings account -- especially after watching the home's value fall from its peak of $350,000. ""Owning your principal residence is perhaps the worst investment an adult can make,"" he says. ""A lot of marketing has gone into convincing Americans that this is a good investment, when it is in fact a horrible investment for 90% of the population.""",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,2010-01-20,0.05,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'American Dream', 'latitude': 4.6327900886535645, 'longitude': -74.09188842773438, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Rasmussen', 'latitude': -19.352399826049805, 'longitude': 146.72279357910156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 46.02280044555664, 'longitude': 7.7513298988342285, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mandeville', 'latitude': 30.35824966430664, 'longitude': -90.06562805175781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Paris', 'latitude': 48.85340881347656, 'longitude': 2.34879994392395, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Guilford', 'latitude': 39.915409088134766, 'longitude': -77.6010513305664, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

Lawyers for the regulator will face off with attorneys of Nomura Holdings Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L) in a non-jury trial in Manhattan federal court, one of the few cases spilling out of the financial crisis by the U.S. government to reach trial. Barring a last-minute settlement, the trial would be the first to result from 18 lawsuits filed in 2011 by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to recover losses on some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that various banks sold Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB). The FHFA said Japan's Nomura, the securities' sponsor, and RBS, an underwriter, misstated important details of the mortgages underlying more than $2 billion in securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, which came under government control amid the economic upheaval seven years ago. The FHFA says that 68 percent of a sample of the loans were not underwritten in accordance with underwriting guidelines and that appraised values were inflated on average by 11.1 percent. Nomura and RBS deny the allegations, arguing no misleading statements were made and any false statements were immaterial. The FHFA is seeking more than $1 billion. If the banks have to pay damages, they would receive the mortgage bonds in exchange, which earlier this week were valued at $480 million. The defendants plan to call former Fannie and Freddie employees, including ex-Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd, to show that factors such as falling housing prices and rising unemployment were behind the losses. Nomura, RBS and the FHFA declined comment before trial. The banks' decision to go to trial contrasts with competitors, who cut settlements for nearly $17.9 billion following a series of adverse rulings by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote. Those other banks included Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). RBS, which paid $99.5 million to resolve claims in one of the lawsuits, faces a separate case in Connecticut federal court over $30.4 billion in mortgage-backed securities. While the U.S. government has obtained billions of dollars in settlements with banks, few cases have gone to trial. The U.S. Department of Justice last year secured an order requiring Bank of America to pay $1.26 billion after a jury found it liable for the sale of questionable mortgages to Fannie and Freddie. Unlike that case, the FHFA's lawsuit is not a law enforcement action but was brought in an investor capacity through lawyers at law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. The case against Nomura and RBS was set to go to a jury. But in January, the FHFA dropped a key federal securities law claim, enabling it to pursue the case before Cote as a bench trial. Many of Cote's rulings in the FHFA case have been favorable to the government agency, including denying bids to dismiss the case. The banks have in court filings complained about her ""gravely prejudicial"" decisions. At a hearing Monday in the FHFA case, Cote said she had already begun reviewing some of the evidence and drafting a decision, but gave no indication of which way she would rule in the trial.

Homeowners now face a new fee when refinancing - Yahoo Movies Canada,Homeowners now face a new fee when refinancing  Yahoo Movies Canada,"Sat, 20 Apr 2024 03:56:15 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvaG9tZW93bmVycy1mYWNlLW5ldy1mZWUtd2hlbi1yZWZpbmFuY2luZy0yMTMyMjEyODEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Movies Canada,"A new refinance fee is now in effect, potentially increasing the interest rate homeowners are quoted if they can’t convince the lender to waive the fee. The enactment comes as the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage hit a new low of 2.71%, marking the 14th record this year. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which supervises Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that back millions of mortgages, imposed a 0.5% fee on lenders for new refinanced mortgages starting December 1. Loans below $125,000 are exempt from the fee altogether. Mortgage rates hit all-time low: Is it time to refinance? “Most applicants will not see the fee as a cost or points charged to them,” said Tony Grech, senior mortgage loan officer at Luxury Mortgage Corp, a mortgage lender. “The refinance fee will be reflected in the interest rate rather than the fees. To the average borrower, this equals .125% to .25% higher in rate.” Why is there a fee? Under the CARES Act passed in March, homeowners struggling from a coronavirus-related hardship could postpone their mortgage payments for 180 days and receive another 180 days of forbearance, depending on their need. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government agencies backing those home loans incurred more than $6 billion in losses related to the forbearance plans. To compensate for this loss, the agencies are tagging the 0.5% fee onto new refinance loans. Here's the history of the 30-year fixed mortgage rate “In my opinion this is nothing more than a money grab,” said Scott Sheldon, branch manager at New American Funding, a mortgage lender. “And the government was very methodical in adding this fee.” Mortgage data and analytics firm, Black Knight reported that, as of December 1, 2.76 million homeowners remain in active forbearance plans, representing $561 billion in unpaid principal. Still, this is a 5.3% decline from the previous week. What can borrowers do? Borrowers should be upfront with their lenders about the fee and ask if it can be lowered or waived altogether. “On the flip side, lots of lenders —us included — on a case-by-case basis, have the ability to waive that fee anyway,” Sheldon said. “It’s going to be contingent on the lender whether to charge or eat the fee.” Borrowers can — and should — shop around to find the best deal along with a lender that is willing to absorb the fee. Record low mortgage rates: Should you cash out and refinance? Despite the new fee, homeowners likely won’t be discouraged from refinancing — given the historically low mortgage rates — and experts expect the refinance boom to continue into 2021. “We have massive demand for refinancing at the moment,” said Sheldon, whose mortgage firm in Santa Rosa, California, experienced a 74% increase in refinance volume from last year. “This fee is not deterring new mortgage loan requests and the government knows it, which is why they can collect this fee.” Dhara Singh is a reporter at Cashay and Yahoo Finance.

AOL,"Fri, 26 Apr 2024 06:10:12 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvbC5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9mYW5uaWUtbWFlLWNlby1zYXlzLWhvdXNpbmctMjAwMzI0NDk4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,AOL,"Home prices are sitting right around their record high; mortgage rates have soared to nearly 7%; and renters are struggling to make ends meet, but according to Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar, the unaffordable housing market hasn’t killed the American Dream just yet. “The American dream is still very much alive. It might just take a little longer,” the former JPMorgan exec told Fortune this week. Almodovar runs the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which was created during the Great Depression to expand the secondary mortgage market. Today, the government-sponsored enterprise holds one-in-four U.S. mortgages and $4.3 trillion in total assets. Fannie Mae doesn't actually provide mortgages to consumers, instead they buy them from lenders and then repackage them into mortgage-backed securities which they sell to investors. This provides liquidity for the housing market, as Almodovar explained. But despite Fannie Mae’s efforts to boost the housing market, Almodovar noted that “affordability is an issue” for consumers today. She still believes there is a path to home ownership for the average American in spite of this, but it won’t be easy. The CEO recommended consumers that are frustrated with current market conditions work to improve their credit, and wait for an opportunity with the prospect of interest rate cuts on the horizon. “There’s a lot you can do in the meantime. Just get smart about what it is to be a homeowner and save and it’ll happen,” she said. Almodovar went on to explain that her two “strategic objectives” at Fannie Mae are figuring out how to make the housing market “more fair and more sustainable,” including by offering a new way for renters to build credit and qualify for mortgages. “Before, if you were a renter in this country, your rent did not count [toward your credit score],” she explained. “Through technology, Fannie Mae is taking that credit risk. If the consumer shows us their bank statements, we can tell what probably is a rent payment, the regularity of that payment, and we can make that consumer eligible.” Almodovar noted that over 500,000 rental units are reporting rent payments today, which is helping renters build sufficient credit to qualify for mortgages. Still, despite this new program and Almodovar’s optimistic outlook on the American Dream, the average American isn’t buying their first home until they turn 36 due to sky-high home prices and mortgage rates. Compared to baby boomers, who managed to buy their first homes by an average age of 29 in 1981, the American Dream has been delayed significantly for millennials and Gen Z. And Almodovar admitted that owning a home is one of the keys to what most Americans believe makes a “good life.” She even referenced how her immigrant parents bought their first home when she was growing up and it “changed the trajectory” of their lives. “At my kitchen table, I heard, like probably many American families do today, talk about a good job, education…and saving for a home,“ she said. “I still remember when I was five years old, they bought their first home. I remember the first night I slept in my room. And I think that’s informed a lot of what I do.” Despite understanding just how critical homeownership is to the American Dream, Almodovar argued that renting is a solid option right now. “A third of households are renters, and I grew up as a renter, so my bias is that being a renter is fine,” she said. Even though homeownership is still the number one way Americans build wealth, and most Americans will say it’s a necessary feature of a “good life,” Almodovar argued that the perception of renting should change. “I do believe millennials still want to be homeowners to raise a family, but it’s not the only way,” she said. “Being a renter, if you have a stable, affordable home, you have roots in your community as well.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vHsGR9WyPz8M1LnkSarX1g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_fortune_385/84a3607932a507ae8b1ffa8ade465b2f,2024-03-20,-0.452,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'American Dream', 'latitude': 4.6327900886535645, 'longitude': -74.09188842773438, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fortune', 'latitude': 35.41481018066406, 'longitude': -90.55316162109375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Almodovar', 'latitude': 40.3838996887207, 'longitude': -3.5955801010131836, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 42.950538635253906, 'longitude': -91.28929901123047, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not directly related,"Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar believes the American Dream of homeownership is still alive despite affordability challenges.

Single-family housing starts are expected to rise but at a lower rate than predicted last month. Fannie Mae’s forecasters are predicting that the Federal Reserve will leave the Fed Funds rate unchanged until Q4 2024, and then will cut twice to a rate of 5.0 percent by the end of the year. This is down from 3 cuts predicted for 2024 in last month’s forecast. However, they are still expecting the Fed Funds rate to fall to a level of 4.1 percent by the end of 2025. Fewer multifamily starts expected The current forecast for multifamily housing starts is shown in the first chart, below, along with three other recent forecasts. Fannie Mae considers any building containing more than one dwelling unit to be “multifamily”, including both condominiums and rental housing units. The multifamily starts forecasts were generally revised lower from last month’s levels. The number of starts forecast for the first quarter of 2024 and for the last quarter of 2025 were revised slightly higher. However, the forecasts for all of the quarters between were revised lower. The current forecast calls for multifamily starts to fall from a high of 387,000 annualized units in Q2 2024 to a low of 359,000 annualized units in Q1 2025. Multifamily starts are then predicted to rise slowly through the end of 2025, finishing the year at a rate of 370,000 annualized units. For reference, the most recent new residential construction report from the Census Bureau has multifamily starts running at an annualized rate of 346,000 units in Q1 2024. Looking at yearly forecasts, the predicted number of multifamily starts for 2024 was revised lower by 7,000 units to 373,000 units. The forecast for multifamily starts in 2025 was also revised lower by 7,000 units to 365,000 units. Single-family starts forecast revised higher The current forecast for single-family housing starts is shown in the next chart, below, along with three other recent forecasts. Every revision Fannie Mae’s forecasters made in this month’s forecast raised their estimate for the quarterly number of single-family starts expected. The revisions to the Q1 2024 forecast and to the forecasts for every quarter of 2025 were 60,000 or more annualized units higher. While the current forecast calls for a slight pullback in starts in Q2 2024, it sees starts growing through the rest of the forecast period, ending 2025 at an annualized rate of 1,113,000 units. Fannie Mae now expects single-family starts to be 1,024,000 units in 2024, up 44,000 units from the level forecast last month. Single-family starts in 2025 are forecast to be 1,099,000 units, up 65,000 units from the level forecast last month. Higher GDP growth expected The next chart, below, shows Fannie Mae’s current forecast for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, along with other recent forecasts. The revisions to the quarterly GDP estimates in this month’s forecast were relatively small, with no revision exceeding 0.2 percentage points. GDP growth in the Q2 2024 to Q3 2025 time span is expected to be marginally higher than predicted last month, but the rate of GDP growth at the end of 2025 is still expected to be 2.0 percent. The slowest GDP growth is now expected to be 1.6 percent, annualized, in Q4 2024. The full year forecasts for GDP growth for 2024 and 2025 were each raised 0.1 percentage point to 1.8 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. Higher CPI Inflation predicted The next chart, below, shows Fannie Mae’s current forecast for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), along with three other recent forecasts. The revisions to Fannie Mae’s CPI inflation forecast were to the upside, particularly in 2024. Forecasts for Q2 and Q3 were each revised 0.6 percentage points higher to 3.2 percent and 3.1 percent respectively. While the year-over-year inflation rate is expected to fall as low as 2.5 percent in Q2 2025, it is forecast to edge upward to 2.6 percent by the end of the year. Looking at whole-year forecasts, the forecast for year-over-year CPI inflation in Q4 2024 was raised 0.6 percentage points to 3.1 percent. The Q4 2025 year-over-year inflation forecast was left unchanged at 2.6 percent. Employment forecast higher for 2024 The next chart, below, shows Fannie Mae’s current forecast for the employment growth, along with two earlier forecasts. Employment growth is our preferred employment metric since job gains, along with productivity gains, drive economic growth. By contrast, the unemployment rate depends on employment but also on the labor force participation rate. Either rising employment or falling labor force participation can drive the unemployment rate lower, but only the former would contribute to economic growth. Fannie Mae foresees higher employment growth in 2024 than in earlier forecasts. Q1 2024 is predicted to have the strongest employment growth with an average monthly gain of 276,000 jobs. Q3 2024 is predicted to have the largest employment growth gain from that called for in last month’s forecast with an upward revision of 54,000 monthly job gains to an average of 153,000 new jobs per month. Compared to last month’s forecast, the expected full year forecast for employment growth in 2024 was revised from a gain of 1,600,000 jobs to a gain of 2,100,000 jobs. The employment growth forecast for 2025 was lowered from gain of 900,000 jobs to a gain of 800,000 jobs. The Fannie Mae April forecast can be found here.

Fed’s ‘higher for longer’ gambit may yet cool home price gains - Inman,Fed’s ‘higher for longer’ gambit may yet cool home price gains  Inman,"Wed, 24 Apr 2024 21:54:33 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlubWFuLmNvbS8_cD0xMDI1ODI40gFhaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5tYW4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjQvZmVkcy1oaWdoZXItZm9yLWxvbmdlci1nYW1iaXQtbWF5LXlldC1jb29sLWhvbWUtcHJpY2UtZ2FpbnMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Inman,"At Inman Connect Las Vegas, July 30-Aug. 1 2024, the noise and misinformation will be banished, all your big questions will be answered, and new business opportunities will be revealed. Join us. Home prices are showing surprising strength in the face of the Fed’s “higher for longer” interest rate strategy, but home price appreciation is expected to cool this year and next even as mortgage rates come down, according to two closely watched forecasts. Economists at Fannie Mae and the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) are now in agreement that mortgage rates will come down only gradually this year and next as Federal Reserve policymakers wait for more evidence that they’re winning their war on inflation. In a March 21 forecast, MBA economists had predicted rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages would drop to 6.1 percent by the end of this year, and average 5.6 percent in Q4 2024. The latest MBA forecast, issued April 18, envisions rates at 6.4 percent by Q4 2024 and 5.9 percent during Q4 2025. In a forecast released Tuesday, Fannie Mae economists said they see rates on 30-year fixed-rate loans dropping to 6.4 percent by the end of this year and to 6 percent during the second half of next year. Mortgage rates expected to fall gradually Fannie Mae economists are slightly more optimistic about the pace of 2025 rate declines than they were in March when they didn’t expect rates to hit 6 percent until Q4. “While we still expect economic growth and inflation to moderate going forward — and, thus, for mortgage rates to drift downward — interest rates existing in a ‘higher for longer’ state seems to be an increasingly real possibility in the eyes of market participants, as well as some homebuyers and sellers,” Fannie Mae Vice President Hamilton Fout said in a statement. But Fannie Mae forecasters also note that their mortgage rate projections were put together earlier this month. Since then, rates have climbed on hot consumer price index (CPI) and labor reports. The Fed’s continued struggles to tame inflation mean there’s “upside risk” to Fannie Mae’s baseline mortgage rate forecast, economists at the mortgage giant said in commentary accompanying their latest forecast. In other words, rates could stay higher than projected. Financial markets no longer expect that the Federal Reserve will start cutting short-term interest rates in June, and the prospects for three 2024 rate cuts as projected by Fed policymakers in December and March are also in doubt. “We now expect just two 25-basis point rate cuts to the fed funds rate this year, with the first occurring in September,” Fannie Mae economists said. “Of course, there remains the possibility that there will be no rate cuts in 2024, but that is not our base case forecast.” Analysts at UBS Group AG also expect the Fed to cut rates twice this year, but see an outside chance that instead of cutting rates, the Fed might have to raise them next year — a move that might send mortgage rates soaring above 8 percent, they warned. Home price appreciation projected to cool While elevated mortgage rates have dented home sales, national home prices have continued to rise, in part, because many existing homeowners are feeling locked in to the low rate on their existing mortgage and have been reluctant to sell. The lack of inventory in many markets has made homebuyers more willing to pay higher asking prices. The double-digit home price appreciation seen during the pandemic cooled in 2022 and the first half of 2023, only to rebound in the second half of the year as inventories remained scarce. Economists expect home prices will continue to rise, but that the pace of home price appreciation will slow as more listings come on the market. “Despite continued high mortgage rates, an increasing share of homeowners appear to be acclimating to the higher mortgage rate environment or deciding they can no longer put off the listing of their homes,” Fannie Mae economists said. New listings are expected to come onto the market faster than sales pick up, “which should help gradually thaw housing inventory and contribute to decelerating home price growth.” Fannie Mae economists believe home price appreciation is poised to decelerate from 7.4 percent during Q1 2024 to 4.8 percent by the end of this year and to 1.5 percent by Q4 2025. When forecasters at the mortgage giant last updated their home price appreciation forecast in January, they were expecting home prices to decelerate more drastically — to 3.2 percent by the end of 2024 and to just 0.3 percent in Q4 2025. MBA economists concur that home price appreciation will cool this year, but remain above 3 percent in 2025. ‘Modest’ growth in 2024 home sales expected Fannie Mae economists expect growth in new listings will help generate a “modest” 4.3 percent increase in 2024 sales of existing homes, to 4.266 million, followed by a more significant 10 percent bump in 2025 sales to 4.691 million. Economists at the mortgage giant are projecting similar growth in new home sales, which are forecast to rise by 4 percent in 2024 to 693,000 homes and by 12.8 percent in 2025 to 782,000 homes. Rising home sales, prices could boost mortgage lending With home sales and home prices both expected to rise, Fannie Mae expects 2024 mortgage originations to grow by 23 percent, to $1.818 trillion, followed by 25 percent growth in 2025, to $2.261 trillion. “We have revised upward our expectation for both purchase and refinance mortgage origination volumes this month, due in particular to our more optimistic home price growth expectation and somewhat lower mortgage rate path, along with an upgraded expectation for home sales,” Fannie Mae economists said. Mortgage refinancing volume is forecast to grow by 67 percent this year to $415 billion and 58 percent in 2025 to $657 billion. But mortgage lenders will still be counting on homebuyers for most of their business, with purchase loan originations expected to climb by 23 percent this year to $1.398 trillion and by 25 percent in 2025 to $1.604 trillion. “It should be noted, however, that given the upside risk to mortgage rates in our forecast, we see downside risk to our originations outlook,” Fannie Mae economists said.

Studying commercial to residential conversions - Yield PRO magazine,Studying commercial to residential conversions  Yield PRO magazine,"Thu, 25 Apr 2024 16:10:22 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8veWllbGRwcm8uY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvc3R1ZHlpbmctY29tbWVyY2lhbC10by1yZXNpZGVudGlhbC1jb252ZXJzaW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yield PRO magazine,"The Multifamily Economic and Market Commentary for April from Fannie Mae focused on the conversion of commercial property to residential uses. It looked at different approaches and discussed the factors that may dictate the role conversions play in providing new housing over the next few years. Setting the background The increase in the number of people working from home since the pandemic has led to many cities having significant volumes of underutilized office space and, to a lesser extent, underutilized hotel and retail space. The shortage of available housing in many markets has focused attention on converting this commercial space to housing. In its monthly commentary, Fannie Mae gathered information on prior studies of these conversions to highlight factors that lead to successful outcomes. Fannie Mae looked both at conversions through adaptive reuse, where the existing building is modified to support housing, and through redevelopment, where the existing building is torn down to make way for new housing construction. A key to success is the housing developer acquiring the commercial property to be converted at a low price. Another key is that there is sufficient demand for multifamily housing in the target market to absorb the multifamily housing currently under development along with the proposed project. Looking at the challenges The commentary notes that adaptive reuse conversions of hotels to single-room occupancy (SRO) housing have been done economically. However, it also notes that hotels are expected to perform well in 2024 and therefore may not be a good source of convertible properties. Retail space utilization is in flux because of competition from e-commerce. However, operating models where local retail space is used in a complementary fashion with e-commerce are evolving, so retail may not be a major source of convertible properties going forward. Surplus office space may be available, but may it require major renovations to adapt it for housing. The report notes that the requirements for gas, water, power and sewer are much higher for residential space than for office space, so the buildings may require costly upgrades. It also notes that code requirements for natural lighting and ventilation of residential spaces limits the plat size of a building which is a good candidate for conversion. Many newer office buildings have larger than optimal plat sizes so they are not good candidates. Fannie Mae suggests that waivers of code requirements may be required to make conversions of existing buildings viable. Examples of waivers cited were allowing residential lofts or SRO’s to be built, or not requiring full upgrades of buildings to current earthquake standards. Second order effects The commentary notes that the changing nature of the neighborhoods where disused office buildings are candidates for conversion itself presents a challenge. The bars and restaurants which were supported by the workers who are no longer coming to work in the buildings may fail, making the neighborhood less attractive to potential residents. At the same time, businesses desired by the new potential residents, like grocery stores and childcare, may not exist until a critical mass of residents exists. These neighborhood changes present risk for the developer or investor considering a residential conversion. The commentary states that commercial conversions are expected to provide about 4 percent of new housing over the next few years. It points to a study indicating that large scale conversion of commercial property to residential uses will not occur unless there are large declines in the prices for commercial buildings, which hasn’t happened yet. It also suggests that the majority of repurposing of commercial real estate will take place through redevelopment rather than through adaptive reuse in the years ahead.

Fannie Mae estimates commercial conversions will contribute about 4% of new housing in the coming years, primarily through redevelopment rather than adaptive reuse."

In 2023, Fannie Mae updated its Selling Guide to include more options for valuations, including value acceptance (formerly appraisal waivers), value acceptance plus property data and hybrid appraisals. Today, lenders are relying on technology more than ever before to deliver accurate, timely valuations. Another area of continued focus is appraisal bias. In 2022, the Biden administration formed the PAVE task force, made up of 13 federal agencies and offices, to combat appraisal bias. Led by HUD, the task force created an action plan the agencies could pursue through administrative action, rather than legislation, and released analysis of its appraisal data.

These highlights share the CFPB’s findings from supervisory examinations completed between April 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023. Although only a portion of the Supervisory Highlights addresses fees, as discussed below, the CFPB’s Newsroom article is titled “CFPB Takes Action to Stop Illegal Junk Fees in Mortgage Servicing,” once again emphasizing the bureau’s laser focus on “exploitative illegal fees,” that it has coined “junk fees.” The Supervisory Highlight’s Introduction notes that the CFPB has been actively monitoring the mortgage “market for emerging risks during a period of increasing default servicing activity since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency.” The bureau remains concerned about the rise in loss mitigation requests, changes in federal programs and policies, and staffing during the last few challenging years. While recognizing that “mortgage delinquencies and foreclosure rates remain near all-time lows,” the CFPB anticipates that the future will bring difficult changes as consumers have higher levels of debt and face affordability concerns. The issues addressed in this recent edition of Supervisory Highlights include: Unfair charges for property inspections prohibited by Fannie Mae guidelines: CFPB examiners found that some servicers improperly charged property inspection fees on Fannie Mae loans, in contravention of the Fannie Mae Servicing Guidelines. Specifically, the examiners found that, in some instances, servicers would charge a property inspection fee even though the property was borrower or tenant occupied and quality right party contact (QRPC) had been established within 30 days, the borrower had made a full payment within the last 30 days, or the borrower was performing under a loss mitigation option. These improper inspection fees numbered in the “hundreds.” In response to the findings, the servicers corrected identified automation flaws behind some of the fees and implemented testing and monitoring to address others. Borrower remediation was also required. We note that the CFPB deemed these improper fees to not only be violations of the Fannie Mae Servicing Guidelines but to also be violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act’s prohibition on unfair acts or practices. Unfair late fee overcharges: Several servicers were found to have engaged in unfair acts or practices by assessing unauthorized late fees. These errors occurred when (1) servicers charged late fees that exceeded the amount in the loan agreement, and/or (2) servicers charged late fees even though consumers had entered into loss mitigation agreements that should have prevented the fees. In response to the findings, refunds were provided and internal processes were improved. Failing to waive existing fees following acceptance of COVID-19 loan modifications: Examiners found that some servicers offered streamlined COVID-19 loan modifications under Regulation X but that they failed to waive fees on the account after borrowers accepted the modifications. These failures violated the regulation’s fee waiver requirement for offering streamlined modifications. The CFPB noted that remediation was being provided to those affected consumers. Failing to provide adequate description of fees in periodic statements: The Supervisory Highlights identified servicer failures to provide a “brief description of certain fees and charges” on periodic statements and, instead, used the generic term “service fee” without any other descriptive information. This practice violated Regulation Z’s requirement that billing statements include transaction history with “brief description of the transaction.” In response to the finding, the servicers implemented changes to provide more specific descriptions of each service fee. Failing to make timely disbursements from escrow accounts: Servicers were cited for failure to make timely disbursements from consumer escrow accounts in compliance with Regulation X. Specifically, the servicers attempted to make disbursements in a timely manner, but the payments did not reach the recipients. To compound the error, the servicers then delayed for months in reissuing the payments. As a result, borrowers incurred penalties due to the late payments. These unsuccessful and late payments were not timely and, therefore, violated Regulation X. Remediation was later provided to the affected consumers. Deceptive loss mitigation eligibility notices: The CFPB examiners identified instances where servicers were advising borrowers that they were approved for streamlined loss mitigation options even though no such determination had been made. In some instances, the consumers were actually denied for the streamlined option. The bureau deemed these notices to be misleading and material to consumers. Deceptive delinquency notices: TheSupervisory Highlights identified servicer errors in sending notices to advise borrowers that they had missed payments and should fill out loss mitigation applications when, in fact, those consumers were current on their payments, in trial modification plans, or had inactive loans. These errors were deemed to be deceptive by the CFPB, and the affected servicers are implementing policies and procedures to ensure accuracy of their notices. Loss mitigation violations: CFPB examiners found that some servicers violated Regulation X by sending loss mitigation application acknowledgment notices to borrowers that did not specify whether the applications were complete or incomplete. One servicer was cited for its failure to include a deadline for acceptance or rejection in its loss mitigation offers. And multiple servicers were also found to have violated Regulation X because they did not provide timely notices to borrowers stating their determination regarding the available loss mitigation options. Further, the bureau found that servicers violated Regulation X by failing to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to properly evaluate borrower applications for all available loss mitigation options. In response to this variety of errors, servicers promised to update their policies and procedures, refund or waive late charges, and to correct negative credit reporting where necessary. Live contact and early intervention violations: CFPB examiners found that servicers “failed to make good faith efforts to establish live contact with hundreds of delinquent borrowers.” Further, some servicers failed to send early intervention notices to “thousands of delinquent borrowers,” as required by Regulation X. In response to the findings, the servicers agreed to waive or refund late fees. Failing to retain records documenting actions taken on mortgage loan accounts: Servicers were cited for failing to document actions in their servicing systems, such as establishing live contact with borrowers, in violation of Regulation X. We see two key takeaways from this latest edition of Supervisory Highlights. First, the overarching theme is that servicers still struggle with the complexities of loss mitigation engagement with borrowers and that the CFPB will scrutinize the smallest details of loss mitigation correspondence and handling. And second, the CFPB continues to focus on any and all fees imposed on consumers and any erroneously charged fee will be called a “junk fee.” Listen to this post",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/2024-04/House%20Model%20Real%20Estate%20Mortgage%20Rent%20Property%20Home%20Keys.jpg,2024-04-25,-0.498,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",Not directly related,"The CFPB found that some servicers improperly charged property inspection fees on Fannie Mae loans, in contravention of the Fannie Mae Servicing Guidelines.

She is also the co-founder of WaterfallCalc, an online loss mitigation decision and calculation tool that enables servicers to streamline loss mitigation calculations while ensuring investor and regulatory compliance. In today’s complex mortgage servicing landscape, the ultimate goal is not just to protect investors, but also to facilitate the best possible outcomes for borrowers. Fannie Mae’s recent training on this very topic underscores a vital aspect of this process–guiding delinquent borrowers through their options as effectively and gracefully as possible. Fannie Mae’s initiative couldn’t be timelier. Over the past three years, streamlined approaches to home retention have enabled millions of distressed homeowners to keep their homes. Yet for many, they failed to address the root causes of financial distress. The primary reason borrowers default is because they have excessive obligations. It’s no secret that wages have failed to keep pace with inflation, or that many Americans are leaning on credit simply to make ends meet. And while streamlined loss mitigation options have provided temporary relief, for some, it hasn’t been enough. In fact, in many cases, it’s created revolving door of assistance that can erode a borrower’s equity. Unfortunately, the assistance spigot gets turned off at some point, and borrowers must confront the reality that they can no longer afford their home or current lifestyle, and “budget reckoning” takes place. When this happens, it’s up to servicers to analyze each borrower’s situation carefully and holistically before determining which path is the most realistic. For borrowers who have already exhausted other avenues, a short sale often emerges as the most practical option. In most cases, a short sale allows borrowers to exit their mortgage obligations with dignity, avoid the stigma and long-term impacts of foreclosure and embark on a swifter path back to financial stability. It’s crucial that servicers do not look at Fannie Mae’s guidelines as an operational hurdle, but as an opportunity to support the financial recovery of families who have found themselves swimming helplessly against financial tides. By providing the necessary support and interventions, we can truly make a difference in the lives of distressed borrowers, guiding them towards a more sustainable future.

CFPB shares update on combating mortgage servicer 'junk fees' - Scotsman Guide News,CFPB shares update on combating mortgage servicer 'junk fees'  Scotsman Guide News,"Thu, 25 Apr 2024 01:07:30 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjb3RzbWFuZ3VpZGUuY29tL25ld3MvY2ZwYi1zaGFyZXMtdXBkYXRlLW9uLWNvbWJhdGluZy1tb3J0Z2FnZS1zZXJ2aWNpbmctanVuay1mZWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Scotsman Guide News,"A new report published by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) shared some of the agency’s recent findings on the mortgage servicing market, including some revelations from its ongoing scrutiny of “junk fees” charged by banks and other lenders. Per its “Supervisory Highlights, Mortgage Servicing Edition” report, the CFPB noted that its examiners continue to find mortgage servicers assessing what it called “exploitative illegal fees,” including improper late fees and unnecessary property inspection fees. Mortgage investors usually mandate a property inspection for accounts that have been delinquent for a set amount of time, with the costs of those visits then generally passed on to consumers. Not every loan is eligible for such inspections, however; Fannie Mae guidelines, for example, prohibit such inspections on mortgages if the property is owner- or tenant-occupied and the borrower is under a loss mitigation or bankruptcy plan. Fannie guidelines outline similar inspection prohibitions for loans under other specific conditions as well, but CFPB examiners found that servicers still charged property inspection fees on many such Fannie Mae loans. “Hundreds of borrowers” were charged property inspection fees barred by Fannie Mae, the CFPB found, causing consumers “substantial injury.” A number of other borrowers were levied late fees that either exceeded the amount allowed in the loan agreement or shouldn’t have been charged because the borrower had entered into a loss mitigation program. CFPB reviews also found other unfair or deceptive practices, including deceptive loss mitigation or delinquency notices, failures to make timely escrow account disbursements, inadequate descriptions of fees, and failures to waive fees following borrowers accepting loan modifications related to COVID-19. Servicers also violated several other loss mitigation provisions within Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Findings in the report cover examinations completed by the CFPB from April through December of last year. In all of the above instances, the CFPB directed servicers to improve internal processes, as well as identify and remediate borrowers who were impacted, including refunding any borrowers who were charged improper fees. The report also states that the CFPB is currently reviewing Regulation X’s current framework to pinpoint possible ways to streamline mortgage servicing rules. “Homeowners cannot just simply switch providers if their mortgage servicer charges them illegal junk fees,” said Rohit Chopra, director of the CFPB. “Since mortgage borrowers are captive to a company they never chose to do business with, we are working hard to detect and deter violations of law.”",https://www.scotsmanguide.com/files/sites/2/2022/04/c579b42e_shutterstock_1658231284.jpg,2024-04-24,-0.603,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bureau', 'latitude': 41.28919982910156, 'longitude': -89.3664779663086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",Not directly related,"The CFPB found that mortgage servicers charged property inspection fees on Fannie Mae loans that were prohibited by Fannie Mae guidelines, causing ""substantial injury"" to hundreds of borrowers."
CFPB Supervisory Highlights Reflect Continued Emphasis on “Junk Fees” - JD Supra,CFPB Supervisory Highlights Reflect Continued Emphasis on “Junk Fees”  JD Supra,"Fri, 26 Apr 2024 15:41:53 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpkc3VwcmEuY29tL2xlZ2FsbmV3cy9jZnBiLXN1cGVydmlzb3J5LWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtcmVmbGVjdC0zMjkzNTM5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,JD Supra,"On April 24, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released the latest edition of its Supervisory Highlights, this time targeting so-called “junk fees” in the mortgage servicing industry. According to the CFPB, its examiners found that mortgage servicers continued to assess junk fees in a wide array of activities, including unnecessary property inspection fees and improper late fees. The highlighted observations reflect that boarding errors and compliance failures that involve the assessment of fees will be categorized as “junk fees” by the Bureau as it and other regulatory agencies address the assessment of fees and product pricing for financial products and services. “Unfair” Property Inspection Fees The CFPB first highlighted unfair acts or practices committed by loan servicers for charging property inspection fees prohibited by investor guidelines. According to the Bureau, Fannie Mae guidelines prohibit property inspections if the property is occupied by a borrower or tenant and one of the following applies: the servicer established right party contact with the borrower in the last 30 days; the borrower made a full payment within the last 30 days; or the borrower is performing under a loss mitigation option or bankruptcy plan. According to the CFPB, its examiners found that servicers charged borrowers for property inspection fees on hundreds of occasions, notwithstanding the fact that one of the exclusions above applied to each of the borrowers charged. The CFPB found that this constituted a violation of the CFPA because “[c]onsumers were unable to anticipate the property inspection fees or mitigate them because they have no influence over the servicer’s practices.” In response, the servicers corrected automated flaws in their servicing platforms, implemented new training and monitoring to avoid these inspection fees in the future and, where appropriate, reimbursed borrowers charged these fees. Despite consumers not being party to investor contracts and limitations on servicing fees varying by investor, servicers should take note that an operational or compliance error resulting in failure to adhere to GSE or investor servicing guidelines may result in claims under the Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices Act (UDAAP) (including, potentially, under the FDCPA) and allegations regarding the assessment of “junk fees”. “Unauthorized” Late Fees The Bureau’s examiners also uncovered instances of servicers engaging in unfair acts or practices by assessing “unauthorized” late fees. The unauthorized late fees arose in two circumstances: when the servicer charged a late fee that exceeded the amount permitted in the loan documents; and when the servicer charged a late fee even though the consumer had entered into a loss mitigation agreement that should have precluded such fees. In response to these findings, servicers reimbursed the impacted borrowers. Here we note that in the Bureau’s view, the assessment of late charges resulting from boarding errors or compliance errors can result in “junk fee” allegations. Improper Fees Related to COVID-19 Loss Mitigation Finally, examiners reported numerous instances of loan servicers charging borrowers for certain fees that should have been waived following acceptance of COVID-19 loss mitigation plans. Reg. X, 12 C.F.R. § 1024 et. seq., authorizes loan servicers to offer borrowers streamlined loan modifications to those who experienced a COVID-19 hardship. Reg. X further mandates that servicers “waive all existing late charges, penalties, stop payment fees, or similar charges that were incurred on or after March 1, 2020, promptly upon the borrower’s acceptance of the loan modification.” The CFPB’s examination found a number of servicers were not, in fact, waiving these existing fees in violation of Regulation X. In response, loan servicers are remediating consumers. This Supervisory Highlight demonstrates enhanced scrutiny by the Bureau of servicer compliance requirements when fees and charges assessed to consumers are involved. In addition, it reflects that the Bureau will categorize the failure to adhere to investor guidelines, boarding errors or general operational errors resulting in the assessment of servicing fees as the assessment of “junk fees,” as the Bureau, along with other federal agencies, scrutinize the assessment of fees and charges in financial products and services, as well as pricing practices in general.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16024_4443.jpg,2024-04-24,-0.722,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bureau', 'latitude': 41.28919982910156, 'longitude': -89.3664779663086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Act', 'latitude': -35.5, 'longitude': 149.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reg', 'latitude': 29.0150203704834, 'longitude': 67.48046112060547, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'C.F.R.', 'latitude': 50.98305892944336, 'longitude': -1.3844399452209473, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"The CFPB found that mortgage servicers charged borrowers for property inspection fees on hundreds of occasions, notwithstanding the fact that Fannie Mae guidelines prohibit property inspections if the property is occupied by a borrower or tenant and one of the following applies: the servicer established right party contact with the borrower in the last 30 days; the borrower made a full payment within the last 30 days; or the borrower is performing under a loss mitigation option or bankruptcy plan."

CFPB also has a threshold under which it doesn’t have jurisdiction over servicing.” Consumers can lose protections as a result of this, he explained. “So, all loans repurchased and placed into a ‘scratch and dent’ pool — essentially loans sitting on someone’s private balance sheet — those consumers don’t have any of those protections,” he said. “Whether you agree with the announcement or not, this is clear evidence that repurchases are generally bad for consumers.” Stork mentioned the Freddie Mac pilot program for repurchases in which lenders “essentially insure themselves against a repurchase,” saying that analysis of the math asserts that “the lender’s goal with that pilot program is to protect themselves from repurchase risk. Essentially, all risks can be calculated, quantified and translated into dollars. This pilot helps mitigate the risk of repurchase, he said. For smaller lenders that pose less risk statistically, there’s no major repurchase obligation, meaning onerous conditions are not imposed on them. “That’s why we’re super excited about this pilot,” he said. Touching on the topic of credit reporting, Stork said that agencies and regulatory bodies, in addition to the three major credit bureaus, are interested in credit report structures. After a notable increase to FICO credit score pricing, it became clear that a lot of industry participants don’t truly understand what the pricing involves. The scores themselves, data from the reporting bureaus, fees for reissuance, updates and combination with a scoring algorithm all play into the pricing structure, Stork said. “I think there’s a very huge difference in the value of data that is known data that we’re buying and then calculating the formula on, versus a custom-built analysis of the value of a property, which includes actually physically visiting the property,” he said. “I struggle with the idea that the data which we can push a button on our computers and grab — I know it’s more complicated than that — but sometimes it’s not the same value to a consumer as making sure that the house they’re buying is really what it’s supposed to be for.” Other topics Stork touched on with HousingWire Managing Editor James Kleimann during the session included increased fee transparency for the consumer.

The price index for GDP purchases increased to 3.1% in the initial quarter of 2024, marking a significant increase from 1.9% in the preceding quarter of 2023. Similarly, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index surged by 3.4% in Q1, up from a 1.8% rise in Q4.

The liberal media, of course, is trying to spin the report in the best possible light and to assuage concerns about a recession. But another top economist says that the signs are indeed pointing to one. Related: GDP Growth Slows in First Quarter While Inflation Remains High. Can You Say 'Stagflation'? According to Nancy Lazar, an economist at Piper Sandler, the U.S. economy is currently facing a unique challenge that she described as a ""bifurcated"" economy, which has only happened twice before and has led to recessions both times: the energy crisis of 1978-1979 and the Great Recession of 2008. Lazar explained that while large businesses benefit from higher interest rates, favorable financial conditions, and government support, consumers are struggling with mounting debts and inflation eroding wage gains. She predicts a 53% chance of a recession. One concern the media is conceding is that the report signals that stagflation may be coming. “For those who do not understand what just happened, we have a weakening economy with rising inflation: The worst possible outcome for the Fed,” the Kobeissi Letter wrote on social media X.Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, emphasizes that any hope pinned on the recent US GDP data to alleviate pressure on US government bond yields will be completely disappointed due to another significant inflation reading.This dual challenge of sluggish growth coupled with elevated inflation “is problematic for the economy and markets, with political and social spillovers,” the economist added.Echoing this message, macroeconomist Craig Shapiro remarked “Weaker than expected GDP and Personal Consumption but higher than expected Core PCE Index and better labor data. That’s a stagflationary mess for folks begging for the Fed put to be activated.”“This report was the worst of both worlds: economic growth is slowing and inflationary pressures are persisting,” claimed Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. Biden, naturally, thinks the report is good news. ""Today’s report shows the American economy remains strong, with continued steady and stable growth,"" he claimed in a statement. ""The economy has grown more since I took office than at this point in any presidential term in the last 25 years—including 3% growth over the last year—while unemployment has stayed below 4% for more than two years.""",https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/297/d586837f-8158-4b07-9a92-72f8ea89a9f9.jpg,2024-04-25,-0.083,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Spencer Brown', 'description': 'Australian rugby union player, born 1921', 'full_name': 'Spencer Brown'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Piper Sandler', 'description': 'American financial services company', 'full_name': 'Piper Sandler Companies', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/US_Bancorp_Center_Minneapolis_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Craig Shapiro', 'description': 'American film director', 'full_name': 'Craig Shapiro'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'GDP', 'latitude': 51.582000732421875, 'longitude': 0.20630000531673431, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Biden', 'latitude': 5.229050159454346, 'longitude': -1.0081199407577515, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'VIX', 'latitude': 47.90599822998047, 'longitude': 4.539999961853027, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DOW', 'latitude': 39.01337814331055, 'longitude': -90.34149932861328, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'POINTS', 'latitude': 39.439998626708984, 'longitude': -78.61028289794922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Lazar', 'latitude': 42.866668701171875, 'longitude': 23.399999618530273, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Erian', 'latitude': 10.009699821472168, 'longitude': 47.48210144042969, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Allianz', 'latitude': 48.154441833496094, 'longitude': 11.588890075683594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Core', 'latitude': 7.216670036315918, 'longitude': 38.91667175292969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

The 2024 Plan updates reflect Fannie Mae's intention to expand and scale its efforts, particularly those related to helping consumers safely and soundly overcome barriers related to limited credit history, burdensome up-front housing costs/ access to credit, and financial and property resiliency. The three-year Equitable Housing Finance Plan addresses the key obstacles faced by historically underserved consumers, renters, and homeowners. The 2024 Plan outlines 23 specific actions that expand upon the innovations and lessons learned from the first two years, and includes two new actions: Expanding pre-purchase counseling support for near mortgage-ready first-time homebuyers recognizing that counseling is a service that can help consumers engage more confidently with their trusted advisors as they secure housing. Creating a standard definition for ""first-generation homebuyer"" that Fannie Mae and other housing market participants can use to evaluate and develop new ways to address the disparities correlated to the lack of savings or generational wealth. In the first two years of the Equitable Housing Finance Plan, Fannie Mae established the groundwork to address housing disparities affecting historically underserved consumers and made progress on achieving its goals through the combined efforts of lenders, industry partners, and community stakeholders. In 2023, the Plan scaled various actions from the previous years, including: Expanded opportunities for renters to benefit from on-time rent reporting to credit bureaus that help consumers establish or increase their credit scores and improve mortgage access through our underwriting technology innovations that consider on-time rent pay histories. Provided affordable housing solutions, down payment assistance, and financial counseling support through our Innovation Challenge winners in historically underserved rural and urban communities. Reduced the barrier of up-front housing costs for creditworthy first-time homebuyers through the special purpose credit program pilot, HomeReady® First, enabling increased access to homeownership opportunities. Enhanced financial literacy, housing counseling, and homeownership education to support consumers in buying and maintaining a home. ""We have continued to build the infrastructure for a housing ecosystem that is fair and sustainable for all consumers,"" said Katrina Jones, Vice President of Housing Equity Strategy & Impact. ""The housing environment today is not without its challenges – and it underscores the need to continue innovating and working together to ensure that access to affordable housing opportunities is available to everyone. We are encouraged by the achievements of the Plan and are looking forward to its ongoing success in making the housing system fairer and more equitable."" Details on the Plan's actions and initiatives are outlined in the 2024 Equitable Housing Finance Plan and 2023 Performance Report.

"Mortgage Interest Rates Today, April 29, 2024 | Rates Unlikely to Go Down Until Later This Year - Business Insider","Mortgage Interest Rates Today, April 29, 2024 | Rates Unlikely to Go Down Until Later This Year  Business Insider","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 10:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYmVzdC1tb3J0Z2FnZS1yZWZpbmFuY2UtcmF0ZXMtdG9kYXktbW9uZGF5LTI5LTIwMjQtNNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Business Insider,"Affiliate links for the products on this page are from partners that compensate us (see our advertiser disclosure with our list of partners for more details). However, our opinions are our own. See how we rate mortgages to write unbiased product reviews.Mortgage affordability is the lowest it's been so far this year, but conditions may improve later in 2024. Currently, 30-year mortgage rates are above 7%, according to Zillow data. Hotter-than-expected economic data has pushed mortgage rates up this year. Until things cool off further and inflation decelerates, rates will likely remain near their current levels.But we could see rates start trending down in the second half of the year. In their latest forecast, Fannie Mae researchers predicted that 30-year rates would fall to 6.4% by the end of this year, and reach 6% by the end of 2025. This would allow more hopeful homebuyers to enter the market and find a home with an affordable monthly mortgage payment.Use our free mortgage calculator to see how today's interest rates will affect your monthly payments:By clicking on ""More details,"" you'll also see how much you'll pay over the entire length of your mortgage, including how much goes toward the principal vs. interest.Mortgage rates started ticking up from historic lows in the second half of 2021 and increased dramatically in 2022 and throughout most of 2023.Many forecasts expect rates to fall this year now that inflation has been coming down. But recently, data has been somewhat sticky, so we may need to wait a bit longer for rates to go down. In the last 12 months, the Consumer Price Index rose by 3.5%. This is a significant slowdown compared when it peaked at 9.1% in 2022, but a slight uptick from the previous month's reading. We'll likely need to see more slowing before rates can drop substantially.For homeowners looking to leverage their home's value to cover a big purchase — such as a home renovation — a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a good option while we wait for mortgage rates to ease. Check out some of our best HELOC lenders to start your search for the right loan for you.A HELOC is a line of credit that lets you borrow against the equity in your home. It works similarly to a credit card in that you borrow what you need rather than getting the full amount you're borrowing in a lump sum. It also lets you tap into the money you have in your home without replacing your entire mortgage, like you'd do with a cash-out refinance.Current HELOC rates are relatively low compared to other loan options, including credit cards and personal loans. We aren't likely to see home prices drop this year. In fact, they'll probably rise.Fannie Mae researchers expect prices to increase 4.8% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025, while the Mortgage Bankers Association expects a 4.1% increase in 2024 and a 3.3% increase in 2024.Sky high mortgage rates have pushed many hopeful buyers out of the market, slowing homebuying demand and putting downward pressure on home prices. But rates have since eased, removing some of that pressure. The current supply of homes is also historically low, which will likely push prices up.House prices usually drop during a recession, but not always. When it does happen, it's generally because fewer people can afford to purchase homes, and the low demand forces sellers to lower their prices.A mortgage calculator can help you determine how much house you can afford. Play around with different home prices and down payment amounts to see how much your monthly payment could be, and think about how that fits in with your overall budget.Typically, experts recommend spending no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing expenses. This means your entire monthly mortgage payment, including taxes and insurance, shouldn't exceed 28% of your pre-tax monthly income.The lower your rate, the more you'll be able to borrow, so shop around and get preapproved with multiple mortgage lenders to see who can offer you the best rate. But remember not to borrow more than what your budget can comfortably handle.",https://i.insider.com/626aa3ef7f0c1c001890576a?width=1136&format=jpeg,2024-04-29,-0.085,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Zillow', 'description': 'online real estate database', 'full_name': 'Zillow', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Zillow_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Current', 'full_name': 'Current'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'House', 'latitude': 34.646728515625, 'longitude': -103.90441131591797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Fannie Mae predicts a decline in 30-year mortgage rates to 6.4% by year-end and 6% by 2025, potentially increasing homebuyer affordability."

Full transcript - Ferronordic Machines (FNMA) Q1 2024: Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Fannie Mae First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, I will now turn it over to your host, Pete Bakel, Fannie Mae's Director of External Communications. Pete Bakel: Hello, and thank you all for joining today's conference call to discuss Fannie Mae's first quarter 2024 financial results. Please note, this call includes forward-looking statements, including statements about Fannie Mae's expectations related to economic and housing market conditions, the future performance of the company's book of business, and the company's business plans and their impact. Future events may turn out to be very different from these statements. The forward-looking statements sections in the company's first quarter 2024 Form 10-Q filed today, and in the risk factors and forward-looking statements sections in the company's 2023, Form 10-K, filed on February 15, 2024, describe factors that may lead to different results. A recording of this call may be posted on the company's website. We ask that you do not record this call for public broadcast and that you do not publish any full transcript. I'd now like to turn the call over to Fannie Mae Chief Executive Officer, Priscilla Almodovar; and Fannie Mae Chief Financial Officer, Chryssa Halley. Priscilla Almodovar: Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin this morning by spending a few minutes on the economic environment and then we'll turn it to our financial and mission performance for the first quarter of 2024. After that, our Chief Financial Officer, Chryssa Halley, will discuss our first quarter results in more detail. The US economy in the first quarter continued to grow, but at a slower pace. First quarter GDP was 1.6%. Inflation remained persistent at 3.2%, still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The 30-year fixed rate mortgage rate averaged 6.7% during the quarter, compared to 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Home supply continued to be constrained, and as a result home prices remained strong. We estimate that home prices rose 1.7% during the quarter. Current interest rates combined with high home prices continued to put pressure on housing affordability. Despite these pressures, consumers seem to be adjusting their expectations on mortgage rates and the home price environment. According to our recent Home Purchase Sentiment Index, consumers are slightly more optimistic about both home buying and home selling conditions. For lenders, overall market single-family mortgage origination activity continued to be sluggish at an estimated $330 billion for the quarter and relatively flat compared to the prior quarter. In multifamily, the market saw property values continue to decline. Nationally, there was slight rent growth of an estimated 25 basis points in the first quarter after rent decline in the prior one. Despite the softening in rents, affordability continues to remain a challenge for renters in many parts of the country. Turning to our first quarter financial results, we reported $4.3 billion in net income compared to $3.9 billion in Q4. As a result, through our retained earnings, we continued to build our net worth, which increased to $82 billion as of the end of March. This further bolsters our financial stability, which enables us to continue to deliver on our mission. To that end, we provided $72 billion of liquidity to the single-family and multi-family markets in the first quarter. In doing so, we helped 280,000 households buy, refinance, or rent a home. This included approximately 89,000 units of multifamily rental housing, the significant majority of which were affordable to households earning at or below 120% of area median income. We also help 76,000 first-time home buyers to purchase a home. These numbers demonstrate our commitment to serving the housing market. We are focused on shaping a market that works better for everyone. This includes our continued work to alleviate obstacles that many renters and homebuyers face in their home purchase journey, specifically insufficient credit and high upfront costs. For example, this past quarter we announced a temporary enhancement to HomeReady, our flagship 3% down 30-year mortgage product, to include $2,500 to use towards down payment or closing costs for purchased borrowers who make no more than 50% of area median income. We also expanded our HomeReady First Special Purpose Credits program to an additional 15 markets, for a total of 21 markets. This program offers flexibilities, such as down payment assistance, expanded income level eligibility, and reduce closing costs for borrowers residing in these markets. And just yesterday, we published a new first generation home buyer definition for use by the housing industry. Disparities in homeownership and wealth among families are strongly correlated to homeownership from prior generations. We hope that developing a standard definition allows the industry to understand and explore new ways of addressing these disparities and to scale programs to support these home buyers. We are also creatively using our role in the capital markets to support our mission. This past quarter, we launched our enhanced single-family mission index disclosures, which help interested mortgage-backed security investors allocate their capital in support of affordable housing and underserved borrowers and markets. These disclosures are the foundation of our single-family social bonds, which are designed to attract additional capital to US housing. To play our important role of providing liquidity and stability to the US housing system, we are laser focused on risk management. In fact, our ability to deliver on our mission depends on it. You'll see this through our sound underwriting standards and the ways we are responsibly helping the housing market see and serve more people. You'll also see this through our servicing standards and support we provide to homeowners and renters in distress. These efforts not only help the consumers that the housing market serves, but they make our business and the market more resilient. Thanks to our dedicated teams, we're continuing to deliver on our mission to facilitate equitable and sustainable access to homeownership and quality, affordable rental housing across America. Now I'll turn it over to Chryssa to discuss our first quarter financial results. Chryssa Halley: Thank you, Priscilla, and good morning. As Priscilla mentioned, we reported $4.3 billion in net income in the first quarter, a $377 million increase compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our first quarter revenues remain strong with $7 billion of net interest income, thanks to healthy guarantee fees. We saw a benefit for credit losses this quarter of $180 million as opposed to a provision of $116 million we recorded the prior quarter. This was driven by a release in reserves due to increases in forecasted single-family home prices, partially offset by an increase in reserves for multifamily. The multifamily increase is due primarily to declining actual and near-term projected property values, as well as increases in actual and projected interest rates compared to the company's prior forecast. Increases in interest rates drove around $480 million in fair value gains compared to approximately $100 million in fair value losses recognized in the previous quarter. In our single family business, we acquired $62 billion in loan this quarter, compared to $70 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. This is the lowest quarterly acquisition volume we have seen since the third quarter of 2000. Continued high interest rates, housing affordability constraints and limited supply resulted in low refinance volumes and put downward pressure on the volume of purchase loans we acquired. Our overall single-family book of business remains strong with a weighted average mark-to-market loan-to-value ratio of 51% and a weighted average credit score at origination of 753. Current economic conditions, including low unemployment, our underwriting standards, and effective loan workout options for distressed borrowers resulted in our single-family serious delinquency rate remaining near historically low levels as of March 31 at 51 basis points. A slowing economy may impact the credit performance of loans in our single-family guaranty book of business, which could lead to an increase in our single-family serious delinquency rate. In the first quarter of this year, we executed five single-family credit risk transfer transactions between our Connecticut Avenue Securities and Credit Insurance Risk Transfer programs. With these transactions, we transferred a portion of the credit risk on approximately $69 billion of unpaid principal balance at the time of the transactions. We paid $380 million in premiums during the quarter on our outstanding single-family credit risk transfer transactions. Turning to our multifamily business, we acquired approximately $10 billion in multifamily loans this quarter compared to approximately $11 billion last quarter. This was similar to the first quarter of last year and is the lowest quarterly acquisition volume we have seen since the fourth quarter of 2015. Our multifamily book had a weighted average original loan to value ratio of 63% and a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of 2 times. During the last several quarters, higher interest rates and investor yield requirements have reduced multifamily property sales transactions and placed downward pressure on multifamily property valuations. According to data from the MSCI Real Assets Commercial Property Price Index, multifamily property values declined 19% from the peak in July 2022 to March 2024 and are now back to the level seen in 2021. We continue to monitor the impacts of elevated interest rates on our multifamily book. Higher rates may reduce the ability of multifamily borrowers to refinance their loans prior to maturity when they typically have a balloon payment due. While our near-term maturities remain low, market maturities are expected to be elevated, which could put additional pressure on the multifamily market. Roughly 1.6% of our multifamily book is expected to mature in 2024, and approximately 3.5% is expected to mature in 2025. Our multifamily serious delinquency rate decreased slightly to 44 basis points as of March 31, 2024, from 46 basis points as of December 31, 2023. In addition to DUS, our primary multifamily risk sharing model, we completed one multifamily credit risk transfer in the first quarter through our multifamily CIRT program. This transferred a portion of the credit risk on $11.5 billion of unpaid principal balance at the time of the transactions. Lastly, I'll touch on our current economic outlook. There is a significant amount of uncertainty related to the Federal Reserve's next steps on interest rates. While our economists currently expect two rate cuts from the Fed later this year, further persistence in inflation poses the possibility of zero cuts in 2024. Home prices continue to be strong and our current forecast is that, home prices will rise 4.8% in 2024, up 1.6 percentage points from last quarter's projection. We believe affordability challenges, the lock-in effect, and a low inventory of homes available for sale will likely persist this year. We expect single-family mortgage originations to grow from $1.5 trillion in 2023 to approximately $1.8 trillion in 2024. Purchases are likely to continue to dominate the market given the rate environment and we estimate they will make up over 75% of single-family mortgage originations this year. 2024 multifamily market origination volumes are estimated to be between $300 billion to $340 billion, up from an estimated $265 billion in volume for 2023, but down from $480 billion in 2022. We believe that with continued high interest rates, elevated new supply completions, and higher than average vacancy rates, multifamily sales activity will remain subdued in the near term, which could result in additional declines in multifamily property values over the short term. Over the longer term, however, we expect sales and valuations will improve due to expected improvements in multifamily housing market fundamentals stemming from positive demographic trends and ongoing job growth. We expect rent growth to remain below historical averages in the 1% to 1.5% range in 2024 as a result of elevated new construction completions and many renters dealing with higher levels of consumer debt. Our expectations are based on many assumptions, and our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations.

Fannie Mae profits grow to $4.3B in Q1 2024 - HousingWire,Fannie Mae profits grow to $4.3B in Q1 2024  HousingWire,"Tue, 30 Apr 2024 18:12:55 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9mYW5uaWUtbWFlLXByb2ZpdHMtZ3Jvdy10by00M2ItaW4tZmlyc3QtcXVhcnRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,HousingWire,"Despite the struggles of its independent mortgage bank counterparties, Fannie Mae delivered $4.3 billion in net income during the first quarter of the year, up from $3.9 billion in the prior quarter, the government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) reported Tuesday. The GSE’s net worth grew from $77.4 billion at the end of 2023 to $82 billion as of March 31. Its growth was “primarily drive by a shift to fair value gains and a shift to a benefit for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income,” Fannie Mae explained in a statement that accompanied its financial results. “The strength of the U.S. economy, higher single-family home prices, and the credit quality of our book of business continue to be important factors affecting our performance,” CEO Priscilla Almodovar said in prepared remarks, noting that Fannie Mae delivered a profit for a 25th consecutive quarter. “This quarter, we provided $72 billion in liquidity to the U.S. housing market. This helped 280,000 households buy, refinance, or rent a home and reflects our strong commitment to managing risk and fulfilling our vital role supporting America’s housing finance system.” The GSE remains profitable even at a time when higher mortgage rates have led to a precipitous drop in home sales and refinance opportunities. It represents a contrast to many of its counterparties. Most independent mortgage banks haven’t turned a profit in about two years and many have complained bitterly about the spate of loan buyback requests by the GSEs. At the height of the post-pandemic housing boom, Fannie Mae purchased $1.4 trillion in loans in both 2020 and 2021. The $72 billion in financing provided during the first three months of this year, however, puts Fannie on pace to finish below last year’s level of $369 billion in single-family and multifamily loan purchases. The GSE acquired $62.3 billion in single-family conventional loans during the first three months of this year. That was 11% below the $70.1 billion it acquired in Q4 2023. It acquired roughly 155,000 single-family purchase loans with an aggregate value of $53 billion in the first quarter, down from $61.7 billion in the prior quarter. More than 45% of these loans went to first-time homebuyers. Refinance acquisition volume, however, increased from $8.4 billion to $9.3 billion. Fannie’s single-family conventional guaranty book of business fell to $3.631 trillion at the end of March, down $6.9 billion from the end of December. This was driven by liquidation volume outpacing acquisition volume during the quarter. The credit characteristics of its single-family portfolio included an average FICO score of 753 at origination. The weighted average mark-to-market loan-to-value ratio for these mortgages was 51%. And the portfolio’s serious delinquency rate (loans at least 90 days past due, including those in foreclosure) declined 4 basis points to 0.51% as of March 31.",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/earnings-profits-money.jpg,2024-04-30,0.002,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'FICO', 'latitude': 4.298900127410889, 'longitude': 9.717599868774414, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Fannie Mae reported a $4.3 billion net income in Q1 2023, up from $3.9 billion in Q4 2022.

Fannie Mae single-family volume drops close to 24-year low - American Banker,Fannie Mae single-family volume drops close to 24-year low  American Banker,"Tue, 30 Apr 2024 14:51:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zhbm5pZS1tYWUtc2luZ2xlLWZhbWlseS12b2x1bWUtZHJvcHMtY2xvc2UtdG8tMjQteWVhci1sb3fSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,American Banker,"Fannie Mae struggled with single-family loan purchase volume in the seasonally weak first quarter, when it fell to depths not seen since the third quarter of 2000, but other strengths netted it a small earnings gain. The influential government-related mortgage investor purchased $62 billion single-family loans during the first three months of the year, down from $70 billion the previous quarter and $68 billion a year earlier, when the number also was near a two-decade low. ""Continued high interest rates, housing affordability constraints, and limited supply resulted in low refinance volume and put downward pressure on the volume of purchase loans we acquired,"" said Chryssa Halley, chief financial officer, in an earnings call. However, other offsetting strengths increased earnings slightly to $4.3 billion during the first quarter, compared with $3.9 billion the previous fiscal period and $3.8 billion a year ago; and executives said Fannie is taking steps to sustainably finance more borrowers. ""Our first quarter revenues remain strong, with $7 billion of net interest income thanks to healthy guarantee fees,"" Halley said. While g-fees were down from $7.7 billion the previous quarter they were up from $6.8 billion a year earlier. Fannie also saw a benefit for credit losses this quarter of $180 million as opposed to a provision of $116 million the prior quarter. ""This was driven by a release in reserves due to increases in forecasted single-family home prices partially offset by an increase in reserves for multifamily,"" said Halley. ""The multifamily increase is due primarily to declining actual near-term projected property values, as well as increases in actual and projected interest rates compared to the company's prior forecast."" Multifamily loan purchases also have been slower and fell to the lowest they've been since the fourth quarter of 2015 at $10.2 billion, down slightly from around $11.2 billion the previous fiscal period and $10.2 billion a year ago. The circumstance suggests the future strength of Fannie's earnings rests largely on continued strength in single-family home prices, the economy and consumer sentiment. Indicators show consumer homebuying interest is persisting with some adjustment to current interest rates even though affordability hurdles are a challenge, CEO Priscilla Almodovar said during the earnings call. ""Despite these pressures, consumers seem to be adjusting their expectations on mortgage rates and the home price environment,"" she said. Also, Fannie has been adding measures to address economic hurdles to buying, Almodovar said. One step Fannie took Monday to extend more loans to the market was to initiate an effort to draw up a standard definition for a ""first-generation homebuyer"" in line with its latest Equitable Housing Plan, which is aimed at closing the racial gap in the residential market. ""We hope that the standard definition will allow the industry to understand and explore new ways of addressing this disparity,"" she said. Another has been a temporary change Fannie made to its Homeready low-downpayment program, which allows borrowers in areas making no more than the 50% of the median income to put $2,500 toward closing costs. (Its competitor, Freddie Mac, has a similar program.) ""We're also creatively using our role in the capital markets to support our mission,"" Almodovar added. ""This past quarter, we launched our enhanced single-family mission index disclosures, which helped interested mortgage-backed security investors allocate their capital in support of affordable housing."" During the quarter, Fannie was the second largest single-family issuer of MBS with a 27% market share, compared to 38% for government guarantor Ginnie Mae, 26% for competitor Freddie Mac, and 9% for the private-label market.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/96/7e/d9bb4e7845929cb3b60d8c495a6d/fannie-mae.jpeg,2024-04-30,-0.044,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fannie', 'latitude': 34.69953918457031, 'longitude': -93.44963073730469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Halley', 'latitude': 34.8520393371582, 'longitude': -95.83666229248047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Almodovar', 'latitude': 38.70935821533203, 'longitude': -4.179080009460449, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Fannie Mae's single-family loan purchases declined in Q1 due to high interest rates and low supply, but earnings rose slightly to $4.3 billion due to strong guarantee fees and a release in reserves.

Will Mortgage Rates Go Down in 2024? What Homebuyers Should Expect - Business Insider,Will Mortgage Rates Go Down in 2024? What Homebuyers Should Expect  Business Insider,"Tue, 30 Apr 2024 18:10:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS93aWxsLW1vcnRnYWdlLXJhdGVzLWdvLWRvd24taW4tMjAyNNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Business Insider,"Affiliate links for the products on this page are from partners that compensate us (see our advertiser disclosure with our list of partners for more details). However, our opinions are our own. See how we rate mortgages to write unbiased product reviews.Good news for borrowers: The wait for lower rates may soon be over. As inflation slows and the economy cools off, mortgage rates should start trending down at some point this year.Inflation has been somewhat sticky in recent months, but it's generally expected to continue decelerating this year. This means the Federal Reserve may be able to start cutting the federal funds rate later in 2024. This would remove a lot of upward pressure off of mortgage rates.The not-so-good news: Rates probably won't go back to the historic lows we saw in 2020 and 2021. And once rates fall, homebuyers will likely have other challenges to contend with, including increased competition and rising home prices.Will mortgage rates go down in 2024? Right now, it's looking like they will, but there are some things homeowners and buyers should know. Check out our in-depth mortgage rate forecast for 2024.Like other consumer rates, mortgage rates are impacted in large part by what's going on in the economy. Rates climbed in 2022 in response to rising inflation. To try to quell rising prices, the Fed started aggressively hiking the federal funds rate, which has also kept mortgage rates elevated. Inflation has slowed significantly since it peaked in June 2022, when prices had risen 9.1% year over year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But in March 2024, the Consumer Price Index was up 3.5% year over year, an uptick from the previous month's reading.Because inflation hasn't come down as much as expected so far this year, we'll likely need to wait a while longer before rates ease. We could see the Fed cut rates this fall. But if inflation continues to stagnate, we might not get a cut until late in 2024 or in 2025. This would keep mortgage rates elevated.Most major forecasts expect rates to fall a bit in 2024. But exactly when will mortgage rates go down? Here's how a few of the leading players stack up in their predictions:The MBA's forecast suggests that 30-year mortgage rates will fall into the 6.4% to 6.7% range throughout the rest of 2024, and Fannie Mae is forecasting the same. NAR believes rates will average 7.1% this quarter and fall to 6.5% by the end of 2024.While there's some dispute on exactly how much rates will decrease, the general consensus is that mortgage rates will go down later in 2024 and end up in the mid-to-low 6% range. It's possible that rates will one day go back down to 3%, though if current trends hold that's not likely to happen anytime soon.Think about the reason why rates went so low in the first place: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed cut the federal funds rate to near zero and purchased a large number of mortgage-backed securities to stave off an economic crisis. This allowed mortgage rates to drop as low as they did, with 30-year mortgage rates reaching an all-time low of 2.65% in January 2021, according to Freddie Mac.No one can predict exactly when another economy-altering event like the pandemic will occur, but barring something extreme, we likely won't see rates that low again for a while. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, even told CNBC that he doesn't think mortgage rates will reach the 3% range again in his lifetime.Because mortgage rates are still so high, some hopeful homebuyers have decided to wait for lower rates to start shopping for homes. But that's not necessarily the best strategy, as there are some advantages to buying right now.At the moment, the vast majority of borrowers have rates that are much lower than current rates. According to a Redfin analysis of Federal Housing Finance Agency data, 89% of homeowners have a mortgage rate below 6%. Many have rates that are even lower; 59.4% have a rate below 4%.High rates have kept many of these homeowners from selling, since they don't want to give up their current rates. While this has severely limited inventory, the lack of additional buyers on the market has also kept prices somewhat moderate.Afifa Saburi, capital markets analyst for Veterans United Home Loans, says that buying now and refinancing later is a good strategy for buyers who want to avoid competition and the higher home prices that will likely come with it.""Would-be buyers that have the ability to buy can avoid a potentially competitive market by locking in a purchase now and taking advantage of a refinance in the future,"" says Saburi.A mortgage refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new mortgage, often with the goal of getting a lower rate or lower monthly payment. If you can afford to buy a house now, you could avoid a tough housing market later this year or next year and have the opportunity to lower your housing costs with a refinance once rates fall. Just be sure to shop around and get quotes from multiple mortgage refinance lenders to be sure you're getting the best rate.Mortgage rates are likely to trend down later in 2024. Depending on which forecast you look at for housing market predictions in 2024, 30-year mortgage rates could end up between 6.4% and 6.5% by the end of the year.All consumer interest rates, including mortgage rates, should start to ease as soon as inflation slows further. But until inflation decelerates and the Federal Reserve is able to start cutting the federal funds rate, rates will likely remain near their current levels.Mortgage rates are currently expected to continue trending down through 2024 and into 2025. The Mortgage Bankers Association thinks that 30-year mortgage rates could fall to 5.9% in 2025.Mortgage rates for 2023 peaked in October, when 30-year rates hit 7.79%, according to Freddie Mac.It's hard to accurately predict where mortgage rates might go in the next five years. Mortgage rates are impacted by the economy, which is often unpredictable or volatile. Right now, it looks like mortgage rates will ease over the next two years and remain relatively steady in the years that follow.Interest rates are expected to trend down later this year and throughout 2025. Borrowers could see lower rates as soon as the fall of 2024.",https://i.insider.com/6502322b992da60019ebeba0?width=1136&format=jpeg,2024-04-30,-0.289,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Redfin', 'description': 'real estate brokerage', 'full_name': 'Redfin', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Redfin_logo.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bureau', 'latitude': 41.28919982910156, 'longitude': -89.3664779663086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'MBA', 'latitude': -1.6971800327301025, 'longitude': 37.618080139160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NAR', 'latitude': 57.25727844238281, 'longitude': 18.625089645385742, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United', 'latitude': 40.21839904785156, 'longitude': -79.48782348632812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Saburi', 'latitude': 12.75, 'longitude': -1.0499999523162842, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

While there is more work to be done, we are making steady progress.” “Freddie Mac’s multifamily efforts are focused on creating and preserving affordable rental housing, driving meaningful advancements for renters and building a more diverse and equitable multifamily finance industry,” added Corey Aber, vice president of mission, policy and strategy at Freddie Mac Multifamily. “Through this work, we are helping address supply and affordability challenges that acutely impact underserved communities, as well as advance resident-centered practices and increase opportunities for diverse and emerging borrowers and lenders.” Among the achievements from 2023, Freddie Mac launched DPA One, a platform that helps lenders match borrowers with suitable down payment assistance programs. Last year, the company also supported homeownership for families of color by purchasing over 9,300 loans through Special Purpose Credit Programs.

Fannie Mae (FNMA) may need a little government assistance. The mortgage lender is reporting a net loss of $6.5B for its fourth quarter, as a result of President Trump’s tax law. While the loss wasn’t surprising, it will most likely require a $3.7B infusion of taxpayer cash. Fannie Mae has paid $166B back to taxpayers since the 2008 bailout. McDonald’s (MCD) is axing cheeseburgers from its happy meals. The move comes as Mickey D’s aims to make at least half its happy meals 600 calories or less by 2022. Family trips to McDonald’s make up 30% of all visits to the fast food chain around the world. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) is moving higher. The holding company bought nearly 19 million ADRs of Teva, bolstering Berkshire’s position in health care.

He steps in after regulators shuttered the startup-focused lender on Friday after a run on its deposits that left it with a dearth of capital. Mayopoulos served as the chief executive officer of mortgage financier Fannie Mae for more than six years before he joined fintech Blend. The collapse of SVB, the biggest bank to fail since the financial crisis of 2008, has crippled stocks and triggered concerns of a contagion throughout global markets. Last week, the bank failed to raise capital to plug a $1.8 billion loss from the sale of a $21 billion portfolio of available-for-sale securities that triggered massive deposit outflows. The regulator has also transferred all deposits — both insured and uninsured — and substantially all assets of the bank to a newly created bridge bank.

The agency posted net income of $3.452 billion, compared with $4.457 billion a year ago. Fannie Mae recorded a loss of $754 million on the fair value of its derivatives, compared with a $229 million gain in the same quarter of 2018. The Washington-based company attributed the drop in derivative values on falling interest rates. Bond yields and other market-based borrowing costs fell in the second quarter amid investor worries over weakening global growth due to trade tensions and bets the Federal Reserve would lower lending rates to counter risks from trade spats and sluggish domestic inflation. In September 2008, the government took control of Fannie and Freddie Mac in a $191.5 billion bailout during the global credit crisis after they were exposed to sour subprime mortgages. The two government-sponsored enterprises have handed over their profits to the U.S. Treasury under the terms of the conservatorship. The two agencies make money by charging fees to guarantee home loans made by banks and other lenders. They also earn income from investing in mortgages and related securities. Fannie Mae's net revenues in the second quarter totaled $5.396 billion, down from $5.616 billion a year earlier. Mark Calabria, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) which regulates Fannie and Freddie, told Reuters last week he hoped the two GSEs would be ready to exit conservatorship within five years. Analysts and the financial industry expected Calabria to begin replenishing Fannie and Freddie's capital by ending the profit sweep to the Treasury and retaining their earnings. But last week he told Reuters he wanted to make that change ""holistically"" as part of a broader renegotiation of the preferred stock agreement terms.
