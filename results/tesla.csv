Asana CEO accuses Tesla of being the next 'Enron' - Business Insider,Asana CEO accuses Tesla of being the next 'Enron'  Business Insider,"Sat, 27 Apr 2024 02:17:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXNhbmEtY2VvLWR1c3Rpbi1tb3Nrb3ZpdHotdGVzbGEtYWNjdXNhdGlvbnMtZW5yb24tc2VjLTIwMjQtNNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXNhbmEtY2VvLWR1c3Rpbi1tb3Nrb3ZpdHotdGVzbGEtYWNjdXNhdGlvbnMtZW5yb24tc2VjLTIwMjQtND9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Business Insider,"A Facebook cofounder's attacks against Tesla continues, and it comes with one of his boldest allegations against the company to date: Tesla is the next Enron.Dustin Moskovitz, the Facebook cofounder who later went on to start Asana, claimed in a Threads post on Wednesday that the EV maker has misled consumers ""on a massive scale,"" accusing Tesla of lying about its Full-Self Driving software and the vehicle's ranges.Spokespeople for Tesla and Asana did not respond to a request for comment.Tesla CEO Elon Musk did not directly address Moskovitz's allegations but instead, on Friday, hurled insults and a slur at the Facebook cofounder on X.Musk then followed up with another post: ""I'd like to apologize to Dustin Moskovitz for calling him a 'retard'. That was wrong. What I meant to say is that he is a pompous idiot whose his head is so far up his own ass that he is legally blind. I wish him the best and hope that someday we can be friends.""I’d like to apologize to Dustin Moskowitz for calling him a “retard”. That was wrong.What I meant to say is that he is a pompous idiot whose his head is so far up his own ass that he is legally blind.I wish him the best and hope that someday we can be friends.Moskovitz had not yet addressed Musk's posts on Friday.On Wednesday, the Facebook cofounder acknowledged the gravity of his comments in his social media post.""I know I sound crazy to most people who don't follow $TSLA closely but at this point it really needs to be said,"" he wrote. ""This is Enron now, folks.""To recap the two-decade-old scandal, Enron, the energy giant, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 after it was caught using creative accounting to hide billions of dollars in debt and lying about its sources of revenue. The company's chief executives were found guilty of fraud and conspiracy in 2006.Moskovitz didn't outline detailed evidence for each of his allegations, but he did share graphs from Tesla that he claims reveal how the automaker is trying to show an increase in miles driven with FSD, Tesla's driver-assistance technology that is critical for the company's path to autonomous driving and robotaxis.The tech founder went as far as predicting that people would end up in jail.No executives at Tesla have been charged with a crime, and the company has never been found liable for consumer or securities fraud.The company has faced lawsuits and probes from federal regulators regarding Tesla's FSD technology or Autopilot and its vehicle range, but there are no legal challenges related to the automaker misleading people about mileage usage with Tesla's driver-assistance feature.Most lawsuits have come from drivers who alleged that Tesla is misleading customers about FSD's capabilities. So far, the company has either settled or has been found not liable.On Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was investigating whether Tesla sufficiently addressed issues with the company's Autopilot software after its December recall of 2 million vehicles.Tesla is also facing a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bloomberg reported last year that federal regulators are investigating how Tesla's driver-assistance software was marketed and if Musk had any involvement in the promotion of the technology.Drivers also have accused Tesla of inflating its vehicle mile range, bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company. A judge said in March that plaintiffs will have to go through individual arbitrations.In the company's 2023 third-quarter earnings report, Tesla disclosed that the Justice Department subpoenaed the company for information related to ""vehicle range"" and other matters.Moskovitz also has long been skeptical of Elon Musk and his ventures.Last year, the Asana founder suggested that Tesla and SpaceX are overvalued and that the companies' leader is given too much credit.""The point is I don't really see these companies as dispensating impact, or at least don't give nearly as much credit to him as others do,"" Moskovitz said on Threads. ""If they were really built on outward lies, rather than just self-deceptions (rose-colored glasses), then we should really see them as scams he got away with.""Moskovitz has even called on Musk to resign from his executive role in all his companies after Musk called an antisemitic post on X the ""actual truth.""""I call on Elon Musk to resign,"" Moskovitz said on Threads last year, adding that he should resign ""(from everything).""",https://i.insider.com/6629adb623b29110d302cc60?width=1136&format=jpeg,2024-04-27,-0.885,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Facebook', 'description': 'American social media and technology company', 'full_name': 'Meta Platforms', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Meta_Platforms_Headquarters_Menlo_Park_California.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Enron', 'description': 'company', 'full_name': 'Enron', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Enron_Complex.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Asana', 'latitude': 14.437299728393555, 'longitude': 121.4490966796875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Musk', 'latitude': 35.535301208496094, 'longitude': 46.19049835205078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National Highway', 'latitude': 25.379169464111328, 'longitude': 68.33399963378906, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Elon', 'latitude': 36.102909088134766, 'longitude': -79.5066909790039, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Space', 'latitude': 51.515098571777344, 'longitude': -0.1912900060415268, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",I don t know,Not-related content

The billionaire entrepreneur compared Tesla to Enron, the energy and commodity company that was bankrupted in 2001 following one of the biggest accounting frauds in history. “I know I sound crazy to most people who don't follow $TSLA closely but at this point it really needs to be said. This is Enron now, folks,” Moskovitz wrote in a post, referring to a graph generated by Tesla AI, celebrating 1 billion miles for its autonomous driving solution FSD. “It may keep going, but people are going to jail at the end. The data is presented in fraudulent ways, and it doesn't say what they claim it says even when they make it up.” “Tesla has committed consumer fraud on a massive scale, from lying about FSD, ranges, and (recently, unconfirmed!) even inflating odometers,” Moskovitz continued. “Many times now, also securities fraud.” In a separate post, Moskovitz raised concerns and suspicions about the accuracy and transparency of Tesla's reporting related to its FSD technology. Specifically, he pointed out that Tesla's updated investor graph is vague about specific dates in March 2024, which raises questions about the timing of the inflection point in the graph relative to a milestone of achieving 1 billion miles driven with FSD. “The new graph is humorously ambiguous wrt dates. Is ""March 2024"" the 1st? The 31st? Why is the inflection *after* the 1B miles milestone in the new graph?” he said. Moskovitz highlighted that the free FSD trial started on March 25, and “incidentally it ends just after we get to see the cumulative FSD update, how strange,” he noted. His remarks imply a potential manipulation of usage stats to artificially boost the data, making FSD adoption appear more rapid.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/MetaPlatforms_800x533_L_1637446023.jpg,2024-04-26,-0.293,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Facebook', 'description': 'American social media and technology company', 'full_name': 'Meta Platforms', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Meta_Platforms_Headquarters_Menlo_Park_California.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Enron', 'description': 'company', 'full_name': 'Enron', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Enron_Complex.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Asana', 'latitude': 14.437299728393555, 'longitude': 121.4490966796875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Dustin Moskovitz, co-founder of Facebook and Asana, accused Tesla of ""massive fraud"" in a post on Threads, comparing it to Enron.

Baglino, who joined Tesla in 2006, is selling about 1.14 million of his shares, the filing said, listing an ""approximate date of sale"" of April 25, and describing it as an exercise of stock options. Tesla announced on April 15 that it's laying off 10% of its global workforce, following a drop in first-quarter deliveries and a steep slide in the stock price. That day, Baglino and fellow company veteran Rohan Patel said they were leaving the company. Baglino announced his departure in a statement posted to X. ""I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday,"" he wrote. ""I am so thankful to have worked with and learned from the countless incredibly talented people at Tesla over the years."" Baglino began as an engineer and climbed the ranks, most recently serving as senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, a job he'd held since 2016. Reporting directly to Musk, Baglino was seen as the unofficial chief of operations by many colleagues. Prior to the latest sale, Baglino had unloaded about $4 million worth of shares in two transactions this year — one in late February and the other in early April, filings show. In each case, he sold 10,500 shares, exercising stock options in both. During earnings calls and other major company events, including a presentation of Tesla's ""Master Plan part 3"" in the spring of 2023, Baglino had become a familiar voice and face to shareholders, often discussing mining, battery manufacturing and performance. Baglino didn't respond to requests for comment. Tesla also didn't provide a comment. Baglino's resigned as Tesla appeared to embark on a major strategic shift. Musk said on the company's earnings call this week that while Tesla still intends to produce affordable, new model electric cars in 2025, investors should focus more on Tesla's ""autonomy roadmap."" Tesla said it plans to unveil a robotaxi, or CyberCab, design on Aug. 8. Musk also touted Tesla's investments in AI infrastructure and the company's potential to finally deliver self-driving vehicle technology, robotaxis, a driverless ride-hailing service, and a ""sentient"" humanoid robot. He even told doubters to stay away from the stock. ""If somebody doesn't believe Tesla's going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,"" Musk said on the call. Tesla's share price, which was down about 40% for the year prior to the earnings report, jumped 18% in the two trading days after Musk's commentary, closing on Thursday at $170.18.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107405929-1713984199208-gettyimages-2150015827-dji_20240416150931_0155_d_hx8dnrxe.jpeg?v=1713984349,2024-04-26,-0.34,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SEC', 'latitude': 45.75471878051758, 'longitude': 14.853890419006348, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Musk', 'latitude': 35.535301208496094, 'longitude': 46.19049835205078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Former Tesla executive Drew Baglino sold $181.5 million worth of Tesla shares after announcing his resignation.

Tesla has been utilizing the expertise of PepsiCo. for an early pilot program involving the Semi to test real-world efficiency and travel. For the past two years, Tesla and PepsiCo. have been working to understand how the vehicle will make fleets more efficient and environmentally friendly as the truck is still making its way toward volume production. However, the Semi launch has been pushed back on several occasions, but executives on Tesla’s Q1 2024 Earnings Call on Tuesday gave a timeline of when they believe the hauling vehicle will be available for more deliveries: “Our first vehicles are planned for late 2025 of external customers starting in 2026.” The thing that has held up production is Tesla’s want for a more affordable and efficient manufacturing process. Additionally, Tesla’s Semi production facility, which is currently being built in Nevada near Tesla Gigafactory, is also being constructed: “So we’re finalizing the engineering of the Semi to enable like a super cost-effective high volume production with our learnings from our fleet and pilot fleet and Pepsi’s fleet, which we’re expanding this year marginally. In parallel as we showed in the shareholder’s deck, we have started construction on the factory in Reno.” Tesla also showed the land where the Semi production facility will be and the progress of the construction: Tesla broke ground on the site in January after announcing the $3.6 billion project nearly a year to the day: The Semi is one of the biggest developments in Tesla’s current pipeline, as it will help the company obtain a vehicle that is primarily dedicated to fleets and logistics.

The company's share price closed up 15% as investors reacted to news surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk's visit to China. Tesla on Sunday said local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on its cars after passing the country's data security requirements. The move raised expectations that Tesla's driver-assistance software Full Self-Driving, or FSD, would soon be available in the country, which is the largest market for electric vehicles. While Tesla's electric cars are some of the most popular vehicles in China, they have reportedly been banned from some government-related properties due to data security concerns. Separately, the Biden administration earlier this year announced a probe into whether imported cars from China pose national security risks due to their ability to potentially collect sensitive data. FSD is an upgrade to Tesla's Autopilot driver assistant. Tesla has offered its FSD technology in China for years, but with a restricted feature set that limits it to operations, such as automated lane changing. Tesla does not yet make or sell cars capable of full autonomous driving. It sells ""Level 2"" driver-assistance systems, marketed under the brand name FSD. Musk's company has been sued in the U.S. by the California Department of Motor Vehicles for false advertising with its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver-assistance systems.

Tesla Cybertruck update brings new Off-Road and CyberTent modes - The Verge,Tesla Cybertruck update brings new Off-Road and CyberTent modes  The Verge,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 21:16:09 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzQvMjkvMjQxNDQ1NzgvdGVzbGEtY3liZXJ0cnVjay1vZmYtcm9hZC1tb2RlLWFwcC1zb2Z0d2FyZS11cGRhdGUtY3liZXJ0ZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Verge,"The Tesla Cybertruck is finally getting an off-road mode via an over-the-air software update, allowing early owners of the monstrous electric truck to finally get granular 4x4-style features that were promised from the start. The news comes via a post by Tesla’s Cybertruck account on X, which shared an image of the Off-Road Mode screen with different settings, options for locking differentials, the ability to turn off rear steering, and more. Off-Road Mode has two main settings: Overland Mode for consistent handling and better traction on rock, gravel, snow, and sand, plus a Baja Mode that improves balance and “handles more freely.” [Media: https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1784984763016577464] Wes Morrill, whose X profile lists them as the lead Cybertruck engineer, also posted some more details about the update. Morrill notes the app allows for a quick look at the vitals of the car, on-board camera feeds you can swipe through, as well as one-touch controls for the off-road features. Cybertruck owners can even get quick access to Wade Mode that raises the truck to handle deep water situations — which is not covered under warranty despite CEO Elon Musk’s saying for years that the Model S and the Cybertruck can act like a boat for short periods. Tesla has also launched CyberTent mode, which levels the truck on horizon, runs the AC, keeps the tonneau cover open, and keeps the outlets powered. The feature is designed to work in conjunction with Tesla’s ugly but functional Basecamp tent add-on. Tesla was selling the $3,000 kit to Cybertruck owners for more than a month — before the software to fully utilize it was available. [Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMVB-tCVkTk] Tesla’s Cybertruck was long pitched as a vehicle designed to help you survive an apocalypse Mad Max-style, but prototypes seemed to get stuck (quite literally) where a Ford F-150 or a Jeep Wrangler wouldn’t. In other situations, the Cybertruck seemed to not perform as well as its EV competition. But with the new app controls in reach, Top Gear put the Cybertruck through a rough off-road outing, and things are now looking more promising. Now, all that’s left is for the Cybertruck to live up to all of its other promises.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDmQrKCX7wrg7ONSwC_zUIAh0nE=/0x0:3832x2160/1200x628/filters:focal(1916x1080:1917x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25426212/GMVbcTFWgAAOeLo.jpeg,2024-04-29,0.116,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Basecamp', 'description': 'American business', 'full_name': 'Basecamp'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Top Gear', 'description': 'boutique in London', 'full_name': 'Top Gear'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.6019401550293, 'longitude': -80.70333099365234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Baja', 'latitude': 46.17496109008789, 'longitude': 18.956390380859375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Morrill', 'latitude': 44.44313049316406, 'longitude': -69.14920806884766, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wade', 'latitude': 33.98427963256836, 'longitude': -94.3827133178711, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Model', 'latitude': 44.19573974609375, 'longitude': 27.38719940185547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Tesla's Cybertruck receives an over-the-air software update, introducing Off-Road Mode with Overland and Baja settings, locking differentials, and rear steering control.

Despite starting deliveries a few months ago, Tesla has yet to fully develop the electric pickup truck’s software, and it is still missing some important features. It’s not uncommon for Tesla to deliver a new vehicle program with incomplete software and start to deliver more features after the deliveries. We reported in February that Tesla released the first big software update for Cybertruck. It improved the truck’s handling, charging, and more. Now, Tesla announced a new big software update for Cybertruck with a focus on off-road features: Tesla is introducing two new off-roading modes geared for different terrains: Overland Mode – More consistent handling & better overall traction while driving on rock, gravel, deep snow, or sand. Baja Mode – Vehicle balance is improved & the vehicle handles more freely when Stability Assist is set to Minimal. The automaker is also adding locking differentials for better off-roading capability for the dual motor version of Cybertruck: On uneven or slippery terrain, if a wheel has limited or no traction, Cybertruck can direct that torque to the opposite wheel. In Off-Road Mode, choose from Locking Differentials options on the vehicle status area or in the Off-Road app. The Cyberbeast, the tri-motor version, is getting a front locking differential: Go to Off-Road Mode > Overland to enable Locking Differential feature. Cyberbeast tri motor has a virtual rear locked differential which is always working in overland mode. Keeping with the theme of the update, off-roading, Tesla is releasing a trail assist under off-road mode. Tesla wrote about the feature: It’s like cruise control, but for off-roading. Trail Assist helps maintain a set cruising speed so you can focus on steering. Trail Assist works as both a hill ascent and descent control helping to keep the wheels from slipping. Off-Road Mode > Trail Assist The automaker is also releasing a few new “on road” features. The first one is called “slippery surface”. The automaker wrote about it in the release notes: Better traction control on snowy, icy, wet, or slick roads to distribute traction evenly across all tires. Dynamics > Slippery Surface Dynamics > Engage Rear Locking Differential for increased traction (should be used temporarily only) Still with on road features, Tesla says that it is also improving ride and handling with a load: Adaptive suspension now estimates payload more accurately & automatically adjusts damping to deliver a more comfortable ride & more consistent, confident handling. Finally, the upcoming software update also comes with the highly-anticipated “CyberTent Mode”. We previously talked about the upcoming mode with the first review of the Cybertent. Tesla confirms that the mode levels the suspension to automatically keeps the surface fla for the CyberTent. It also keeps the tonneau cover open to accommodate tent. Tesla added that “lights, AC amd outlets will stay on as well if enabled.” There’s no word on the timing of the release of the update other than it is coming “soon”.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Tesla-Cybertruck-off-road-hero.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,2024-04-29,0.058,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Baja', 'latitude': 46.17496109008789, 'longitude': 18.956390380859375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Road', 'latitude': 51.28390121459961, 'longitude': -2.281409978866577, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Trail', 'latitude': 42.648460388183594, 'longitude': -122.81060028076172, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Tesla's upcoming Cybertruck software update introduces off-roading features like Overland Mode, Baja Mode, locking differentials, and Trail Assist.

Sure, this all-electric truck can handle perfectly controlled environments, but truckers know that things are rarely perfect on the roads in the real world. After we wrote about how the Tesla Semi-Truck blew away a diesel-fueled truck in acceleration, even on steep grades, our readers still had plenty of questions about the Tesla truck design. Some of those questions focused on whether it had the control and power to handle rough weather and icy roads. We sought answers to those questions about weather from Tesla itself but did not receive a response. Fortunately, we have some other means of investigating this issue, including a recent video from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) that may provide some answers. CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER How the Tesla Semi-Truck appeared to perform in poor weather The CHP created a Facebook post in early 2024 that mentioned closing Donner Summit along I-80 in California after multiple semi-trucks lost control on icy roads. The announcement itself was not the notable item, though. What caught our attention – and the attention of 3.5 million-plus viewers – was a video of a Tesla Semi-Truck slowly but successfully navigating the icy roads. The CHP didn’t mention the Tesla truck in the post, but the video clearly shows its unique design. MORE: MONSTER PLANE COULD REPLACE TRUCKS AND TRAINS We must say that although the video seemed to show the Tesla Semi-Truck handling the ice like a cold-weather pro, it was only 17 seconds long. It’s impossible to tell just how far the truck traveled during the video and how fast it was going. We also don't know what happened with the truck after the officer stopped recording. Still, the video evidence appears to show that icy conditions were no problem for this Tesla Semi-Truck. If true, this would indicate that it could perform anywhere in the United States at any time of the year rather than only in warm-weather states that experience primarily mild weather. MORE: A DIY VERSION OF TESLA'S CYBERTRUCK MADE OUT OF WOOD How the Tesla Semi-Truck could affect emissions on a large scale Tesla claims its Semi-Truck has an energy consumption of less than 2 kWh per mile, even when fully loaded at 82,000 pounds. Such energy savings could be monumental in terms of cutting emissions. Transport & Environment estimates semi-trucks in Europe account for 27% of all vehicle emissions while only representing 2% of the vehicles on the road. MORE: UNFORGETTABLE MOTHER’S DAY GIFTS 2024 The EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) calls heavy-duty trucks the ""fastest growing contributor to emissions,"" making an all-electric option like the Tesla Semi-Truck game-changing. With the EPA expecting freight activity in the United States to grow by 45% from today to 2040, finding new options for cutting emissions is vital. Of course, to provide such benefits, the Tesla truck would have to prove that it can handle the conditions that truckers encounter every day, including performing in less-than-ideal road conditions and weather. What the vehicle seemed to do in the CHP video would indicate a positive step forward. MORE: HOW AI IS PAVING THE WAY TO SMOOTHER STREETS USING AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS Kurt’s key takeaways The Tesla Semi-Truck appears to show video proof of the strength of its design, such as the power it delivers on hills. It proved its efficiency for traveling long distances on a single charge. And now it seems to be showcasing safe operation in winter road conditions. It will be interesting to see what this truck can deliver in the near future as it attempts to overcome skeptics. Do you believe Tesla Semi-Trucks are the future of the trucking industry?

Voices,"Tesla has, so far, won or settled wrongful death cases claiming the electric car maker’s Autopilot driving assist feature is unsafe and led to fatal accidents. The most recent lawsuit, settled for undisclosed terms just days ahead of a trial scheduled in March, may have been set to pose the most powerful argument yet over the safety of Tesla’s automation systems by focusing on what level of understanding the company has about drivers’ behavior when driving with driver assist software engaged. Matthew Wansley, a Cardozo School of Law associate professor with experience in the automated-vehicle industry, told Reuters ahead of the trial and before the settlement was announced that Tesla’s knowledge of likely driver behavior could prove legally pivotal. “If it was reasonably foreseeable to Tesla that someone would misuse the system, Tesla had an obligation to design the system in a way that prevented foreseeable misuse,” Wansley said. Recall redux In December, Tesla recalled over 2 million vehicles — nearly every car it has ever sold in the U.S. — following the conclusion of a two-year long investigation by federal regulators into Tesla’s driving automation features. In a letter to Tesla, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had reviewed 956 Tesla crashes where the manufacturer’s Autopilot was initially alleged to have been in use, then focused on a narrower set of 322 Autopilot-involved crashes, including frontal impacts and impacts from potential inadvertent disengagement of the system. At the time, federal regulators determined the configuration of Tesla’s driving automation systems can put drivers in hazardous situations. “In certain circumstances when Autosteer is engaged, and the driver does not maintain responsibility for vehicle operation and is unprepared to intervene as necessary or fails to recognize when Autosteer is canceled or not engaged, there may be an increased risk of a crash,” the NHTSA wrote in its letter to Tesla. Per the recall, Tesla’s plan was to issue over-the-air software updates to most owners of Model 3, Model S, Model X and Model Y vehicles that will increase the number of alerts and warnings that the driving automation software issues to drivers to ensure they are engaged or ready to engage with driving responsibly. Last week, NHTSA announced it was opening a follow-up investigation after it found evidence of 20 Tesla vehicles involved in crashes that had been operating with the updated software. Its Office of Defect Investigation said it was opening the investigation to “further evaluate the adequacy of the remedy” following the December recall. Adding to the woes surrounding Tesla’s driving automation systems, The Washington Post reports the company has at least eight lawsuits headed to trial in the coming year that involve fatal or otherwise serious crashes that occurred while the driver was allegedly relying on Autopilot. “A reckoning is coming as more and more of these cases are going to see the light of a jury trial,” Brett Schreiber, a lawyer with Singleton Schreiber who is representing the family of Jovani Maldonado, 15, who was killed in Northern California when a Tesla in Autopilot rear-ended his family’s pickup truck in 2019, told the Post. Negative outcomes from legal challenges could put the world’s most popular electric car brand in deeper financial straights as it works to navigate a slowdown in the growth of EV sales and a smaller slice of the overall market. Earlier this month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced the company’s plans to lay off 14,000 employees, about 10% of its global workforce of around 140,000. In a memo to Tesla employees, Musk cited the need to find savings and achieve his goal of making Tesla more “lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.” “As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” Musk wrote in the email.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/deseret_news_992/a57e01230e54bc4c963520bce705c6e6,2024-04-30,-0.733,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cardozo', 'latitude': -32.633331298828125, 'longitude': -56.349998474121094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reuters', 'latitude': 50.67449951171875, 'longitude': 9.351499557495117, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wansley', 'latitude': -32.91053009033203, 'longitude': 27.929269790649414, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National Highway', 'latitude': 25.379169464111328, 'longitude': 68.33399963378906, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Model', 'latitude': 37.372779846191406, 'longitude': -104.24527740478516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 38.895111083984375, 'longitude': -77.03636932373047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Schreiber', 'latitude': 48.81679916381836, 'longitude': -87.24996948242188, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Post', 'latitude': 33.1909294128418, 'longitude': -101.37818908691406, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Musk', 'latitude': 35.535301208496094, 'longitude': 46.19049835205078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,Tesla has settled or won wrongful death cases related to its Autopilot feature.

Even as earnings for the first quarter come in better than expected, the market has struggled to climb higher consistently as rising Treasury yields weigh on sentiment for equities, reminding investors of the period in 2023 when higher yields sent stocks crashing. ""Higher rates are now a systemic problem for equities,"" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. Kantrowitz pointed to the market action over the last month, which could be simplified to a basic formula: When Treasury yields have risen, stocks have fallen. And recently, yields have soared. The 10-year Treasury yield is up more than 40 basis points to 4.63% since the start of April, its highest level since November 2023. In that time, the S&P 500 has fallen about 3%. ""At this point it's really hard to see equities going up without rates going down,"" Kantrowitz said in a video breakdown of his research distributed to clients. The same action could be seen in the two-year Treasury yield, where Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel has flagged 5% as the key technical level that weighed on stocks during last year's bond-driven sell-off. Notably, stocks' recent decline from their highs throughout April came as the two-year hit 5%. On Monday, the two-year sat at 4.98%. The rise in yields has come as investors have heavily scaled back their bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year. Market expectations have shifted from nearly seven cuts to around just one in 2024, per Bloomberg data. And Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a research note on Sunday this upside pressure in yields is likely to remain unless Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""surprises on the dovish side"" during his press conference on Wednesday. Given recent hot inflation readings, economists don't expect that to be the case when Powell speaks. ""We expect the main message from the press conference to be that policy needs more time to work,"" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a research note previewing the event. ""Powell should indicate the next move is still likely to be a rate cut, but the Fed will be in wait-and-see mode until it achieves confidence it desires on inflation."" This would be a reiteration of prior comments from Powell, which brought little relief to the bond market.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/86crXvpFaYbZRdezz2ExWA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-01/1508b070-af8b-11ee-badf-6dfed5b63cda,2024-04-29,-0.259,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Piper Sandler', 'description': 'American financial services company', 'full_name': 'Piper Sandler Companies', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/US_Bancorp_Center_Minneapolis_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Mike Wilson', 'description': 'American basketball player, born 1959', 'full_name': 'Mike Wilson'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ISI', 'latitude': 56.49277877807617, 'longitude': 24.7166690826416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Powell', 'latitude': 36.0317497253418, 'longitude': -84.02796936035156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,Not-related content.

Just kidding. The layoffs were so poorly executed that security was forced to scan employees’ badges at the door to figure out who had been laid off. And, apparently, that included a guy who had taken to sleeping in his car and showering at the factory so he could work longer hours. Nico Murillo, who until April 15 had been working as a production supervisor at Tesla’s Freemont facility, recently posted his layoff experience on LinkedIn and sharing the timeline of how he discovered he’d lost his job: 4:30am: Opened my laptop, account was de activated. Thought it was just another IT problem, so didn’t think anything of it. 5:00am I usually check my emails while on my autopilot commute to work (1hr 30min drive) Email read: “Unfortunately as a result, your position has been eliminated by this restructuring.” 5:05am Texted my manager, but he said “everyone got it, we’ll get more info later” 5:50am Tried to badge in, and the security guard took my badge and told me I was laid off 6:00am Sat in my car in disbelief. You would think that someone who works at Tesla would know that even with Tesla’s so-called “Full Self-Driving” software, Autopilot is only a Level 2 system and still requires the driver to monitor the road instead of checking emails. After all, its use has been linked to more than 200 crashes and at least 29 deaths, but for the purposes of this post, we’re just going to move on because his story takes a quick, depressing turn. According to Murillo, in his five years at Tesla, he moved from an entry-level Production Associate role to Lead Production Associate and eventually Production Supervisor. Also, with a 90-minute commute each way, in 2023, he apparently started sleeping in his car, showering at the factory and microwaving his dinners on days that he was working. Unfortunately for Murillo, no amount of loyalty to a company is going to be met with any amount of loyalty to you. Even if you post better numbers than your coworkers, you’re ultimately just another meat sack they’re forced to pay until they can figure out how to replace you. Which might explain why the United Auto Workers union is making huge gains in Alabama, of all states, and Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga recently voted to join the UAW even though a similar vote failed back in 2019. Hopefully, Tesla’s Fremont plant isn’t too far behind Volkswagen’s Chattanooga facility. They deserve better than being forced to line up at the door so they can wait for security to figure out who still has a job.

Yet, in a very public snub that Modi won’t quickly forget, the company CEO made time for Chinese premier Li Qiang. And well Musk might. Tesla needs China more than China needs Tesla. After the US, China is Tesla’s second biggest market. And ominously, in the first quarter of the year, Tesla’s sales in China slipped by 4 percent in a domestic EV market that has expanded by more than 15 percent. That’s enough of a hit for any CEO to jump in a Gulfstream and fly across the Pacific for an impromptu meeting with a Chinese premier. Globally, Tesla has lost nearly a third of its value since January, and earlier this month, Tesla’s worldwide vehicle deliveries in the first quarter fell for the first time in almost four years. As they are wont to do, Tesla investors continue to complain over repeated delays to the company’s rollout of cars with genuine driverless capabilities. One of Tesla’s stop-gap technologies—a now heavily-discounted $8,000 add-on—is marketed as Full Self-Driving, or FSD. But, like the similarly confusingly named Autopilot feature, it still requires driver attention, and may yet still prove to be risky. Among the deals said to have been unveiled at Sunday’s meeting with Li Qiang was a partnership granting Tesla access to a mapping license for data collection on China’s public roads by web search company Baidu. This was a “watershed moment,” Wedbush Securities senior analyst Dan Ives said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. However, Tesla has been using Baidu for in-car mapping and navigation in China since 2020. The revised deal, in which Baidu will now also provide Tesla with its lane-level navigation system, clears one more regulatory hurdle for Tesla’s FSD in China. It does not enable Tesla to introduce driverless cars in China or anywhere else, as some media outlets have reported. Press reports have also claimed that Musk has secured permission to transfer data collected by Tesla cars in China out of China. This is improbable, noted JL Warren Capital CEO and head of research Junheng Li, who wrote on X: “[Baidu] owns all data, and shares filtered data with Tesla. Just imagine if [Tesla] has access to real-time road data such as who went to which country’s embassy at what time for how long.” That, she stressed, would be “super national security!” According to Reuters, Musk is still seeking final approval for the FSD software rollout in China, and Tesla still needs permission to transfer data overseas. Li added that a rollout of even a “supervised,” data-lite version of FSD in China is “extremely unlikely.” She pointed to challenges for Tesla to support local operation of the software. Tesla still “has no [direct] access to map data in China as a foreign entity,” she wrote. Instead, Tesla is likely using the deal extension with Baidu as an FSD workaround, with the data collected in China very much staying in China. Despite this, Tesla shares have jumped following news of the expanded Baidu collaboration. Furthermore, Li said there’s “no strategic value” for Beijing to favor FSD when there are several more advanced Chinese alternatives. (We’ve tested them.) “Chinese EVs are simply evolving at a far faster pace than Tesla,” agrees Shanghai-based automotive journalist and WIRED contributor Mark Andrews, who tested the driver assistance tech available on the roads in China. The US-listed trio of Xpeng, Nio, and Li Auto offer better-than-Tesla “driving assistance features” that rely heavily on lidar sensors, a technology that Musk previously dismissed, but which Tesla is now said to be testing. Although dated in shape and lacking in the latest tech, a Tesla car is nevertheless more expensive in China than most of its rivals. Tesla recently slashed prices in China to arrest falling sales. Musk’s flying visit to China smacked of “desperation,” says Mark Rainford, owner of the Inside China Auto channel. “[Tesla] sales are down in China—the competition has weathered the price cuts so far and [the Tesla competitors have] a seemingly endless conveyor belt of talented and beautiful products.” Rainford further warns that the “golden period for Tesla in China” is “at great risk of collapsing.” Tesla opened its first gigafactory in Shanghai five years ago, and it is now the firm’s largest—but the automaker has been playing tech catchup in China for some time. In addition to Xpeng, Nio, and Li, there are other Chinese car companies competing with Tesla on autonomous driving, as Musk will see if he visits the Beijing Motor Show, which runs through this week. Beijing is now arguably the world’s preeminent automotive expo, but Tesla is not exhibiting—a sign that it has little new to offer famously tech-hungry Chinese autobuyers. Pointedly, the Cybertruck is not road-legal in China, although that hasn’t stopped Tesla from displaying the rust-prone electric pickup in some of its Chinese showrooms. Likewise, Tesla has just announced plans for a European Cybertruck tour. But, just like in China, the EV pickup cannot be sold in the EU, either—and according to Tesla's lead on vehicle engineering, it likely never will be. Speaking on tighter pedestrian safety regulations in the EU compared to the US, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering, Lars Moravy, told Top Gear that “European regulations call for a 3.2-mm external radius on external projections. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to make a 3.2-mm radius on a 1.4-mm sheet of stainless steel.” The “Cybertruck Odyssey” tour—as Tesla’s European X account calls it—may titillate Tesla fans, but it could prove to be about as useful as shooting a Roadster into space.","https://media.wired.com/photos/662fb56f9a6a9c151b06d903/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/Elon-Musk-China-Visit-Gear-GettyImages-1757120867.jpg",2024-04-29,-0.329,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Li Qiang', 'description': 'Chinese Paralympian', 'full_name': 'Li Qiang'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Li Auto', 'description': 'Chinese car company', 'full_name': 'Li Auto', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Li_Auto_logo.png'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Top Gear', 'description': 'boutique in London', 'full_name': 'Top Gear'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'India', 'latitude': 20.0, 'longitude': 77.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Modi', 'latitude': 6.228089809417725, 'longitude': 28.019819259643555, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Musk', 'latitude': 35.535301208496094, 'longitude': 46.19049835205078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'China', 'latitude': 35.0, 'longitude': 105.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pacific', 'latitude': 38.48139190673828, 'longitude': -90.75, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Baidu', 'latitude': 29.681669235229492, 'longitude': 121.5472183227539, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reuters', 'latitude': 50.67449951171875, 'longitude': 9.351499557495117, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Beijing', 'latitude': 39.907501220703125, 'longitude': 116.39723205566406, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Shanghai', 'latitude': 31.222219467163086, 'longitude': 121.45806121826172, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Nio', 'latitude': -6.864580154418945, 'longitude': 156.97267150878906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Rainford', 'latitude': 53.50223159790039, 'longitude': -2.7883899211883545, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Tesla faces challenges in China, with declining sales and competition from advanced Chinese EV alternatives.

Musk arrived in the Chinese capital on an unannounced visit on Sunday, intending to discuss the rollout of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software and the data-transfer permissions, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Advertisement Â· Scroll to continue Among the wins during Musk's trip, which was first reported by Reuters, was a key endorsement from a top Chinese auto association that said Tesla's Model 3 and Y cars were compliant with data-security regulations. That would enable local governments to allow Tesla cars into parts of China they were previously barred from, Chinese media reported, citing a statement from Tesla. Tesla has also reached an agreement with Baidu to use the Chinese giant's mapping license for data collection on China's public roads, according to two people, who described that as a step toward FSD rollout in China. Advertisement Â· Scroll to continueReport this ad Musk's meetings included one with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who praised Tesla's development in China. Tesla did not comment for this report. Musk said this month on his social media site X that Tesla may make FSD available to customers in China ""very soon"". The question of whether Tesla can win Beijing's approvals for overseas data transfer remains critical to its plans for FSD in China and for autonomous vehicles globally. Reuters could not determine what progress, if any, Musk made in securing such approvals during his Beijing trip. Getting approvals in China to sell a so-called ""level 2"" driver-assistance system such as FSD isn't the hard part. But Tesla has considered the ability to transfer data out of China pivotal to its development of autonomous vehicles. Tesla and other automakers use the data provided by their cars to train autonomous driving systems to perform increasingly complicated tasks without supervision from a human driver. Without Beijing's approval for data transfer, Tesla could not use data collected by its cars in China to develop autonomous cars for a global customer base. Despite its name, Tesla's Full Self-Driving vehicle is not fully autonomous and requires drivers to stay ready to take over. Musk's China trip marked the next step in a major pivot to Tesla's strategy that has accelerated over a chaotic last few weeks for Tesla. The automaker rushed to prioritize its efforts to develop self-driving cars while putting its ambitions to become a mass-market seller of affordable electric vehicles on the back burner.

Just a week before the Beijing trip, Musk abandoned a planned trip to India and a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where he had been expected to discuss an investment including a new factory to build affordable Teslas. The Indian government did not have an immediate comment on Musk's China visit. If Tesla shares close at their current price of $196.40, it would mark the stock's largest one-day percentage gain since March 2021, according to LSEG data. Prior to Monday's share price jump, Tesla shares had lost about a third of their value this year as concerns have grown about its growth trajectory. Last week, Tesla reported its first decline in quarterly revenue since 2020. SELF-DRIVING COMPETITION Equity analysts at Wedbush called the surprise visit ""a major moment for Tesla"" if Musk is able to obtain approval to transfer the China data overseas. Chinese regulators have required Tesla to store all data collected by its Chinese fleet in Shanghai since 2021, leaving the company unable to transfer any back to the United States. China's complicated traffic conditions with more pedestrians and cyclists than in many other markets provide more scenarios that are key for training autonomous driving algorithms at a faster pace, according to industry experts. Tesla cars have been banned from entering Chinese military complexes over security concerns relating to cameras installed on its vehicles. Its cars have also been turned away from sites holding important political events, such as an annual summer leadership conclave the ruling Communist Party held in 2022. The endorsement from the Chinese auto group, which said Tesla complies with China's data regulations, could allow Tesla cars to access such sites. Rival Chinese automakers and suppliers such as XPeng (9868.HK)New Tab, opens new tab and Huawei Technologies (HWT.UL) have been seeking to gain an advantage over Tesla by rolling out self-driving software of their own.

Tesla stock surges on 'watershed' full self-driving approval in China - Yahoo Finance,Tesla stock surges on 'watershed' full self-driving approval in China  Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 20:13:54 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90ZXNsYS1zdG9jay1zdXJnZXMtb24td2F0ZXJzaGVkLWZ1bGwtc2VsZi1kcml2aW5nLWFwcHJvdmFsLWluLWNoaW5hLTE3MTQ0OTc3MC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance,"Tesla (TSLA) stock soared on Monday following reports that CEO Elon Musk won Chinese approval to deploy the automaker’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) autonomous software on the mainland. As was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, people familiar with the matter said that officials told Tesla that they had tentatively approved FSD in the country during Musk’s 24-hour visit to Beijing over the weekend. Separately, Bloomberg earlier reported that Tesla will use Chinese tech company Baidu’s street-level mapping data to power FSD. Tesla had been previously using Baidu’s mapping data for satellite navigation in its cars. Working with a Chinese company helped with regulatory approval as data privacy and security risks are minimized, the reports said. Tesla closed up 15.3%, hitting its highest levels since March 1. Tesla stock is now up over 30% in the past four trading sessions. While pricing for FSD in China was not disclosed, in the US, Tesla charges $8,000 up-front for lifetime use (down from $12,000) and $99 a month for subscription services. Adding FSD functionality in China is a big deal for the automaker not just for the added incremental revenue, but also in terms of the competitive edge it gives Tesla against rivals like NIO, Li Auto, XPeng, and even tech giants like Xiaomi, which is entering the auto market with semi-autonomous software of its own. “What Tesla has to do is stay on the forefront of innovation. They have to be the most technologically advanced solution,” China expert Leland Miller of China Beige Book said to Yahoo Finance. “We have a domestic market that is saturated, and a price war going on … [Tesla] needs to stay on the top of the technological ladder.” Tesla's lack of FSD in its cars likely weighed on sales in China, where the latest tech features are prioritized. Per China’s Passenger Car Association, Tesla’s share of China’s market slid to 6.7% in Q4 of 2023 from 10.5% in the prior year despite aggressive price cuts. Globally, Tesla’s Q1 deliveries fell to 387K units from 423K a year ago. Nevertheless, gaining preliminary approval for FSD and a data deal with Baidu are two huge wins for Tesla. “Musk winning FSD approval in the key China market is a watershed moment for the Tesla story in our view,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, further claiming it was a “home run” for Musk. “While the long term valuation story at Tesla hinges on FSD and autonomous, a key missing piece in that puzzle is Tesla making FSD available in China which is now a done deal.” Tesla’s focus on autonomous driving and even its robotaxi future are considered long-term catalysts for the company, which has seen its shareholder class turn over and trade significantly lower in the past couple of weeks alone. A major part of developing Tesla’s AI-powered autonomous software is the collection of vast quantities of data to feed into its software model. Tesla has had to store its data in China since 2021 per a regulatory requirement, Ives noted. Tesla gaining further approval to migrate that data in China to its US-based servers will accelerate “training its algorithms for its autonomous technology globally,” Ives said. Furthermore, China-based FSD users may be more inclined to opt into the service and use it more frequently because the government has promoted self-driving in various localities, thus providing more data for Tesla to improve its FSD software.

Toyota was the top brand in California this quarter, notching a 9.3% increase in registrations, followed by Honda, which marked an 18.6% rise so far this year. Tesla registrations have dropped in California year to date, with a 7.8% drop in the first quarter, following a 9.8% drop in the last quarter of 2023. California makes up 32.5% of registrations of battery electric vehicles in the U.S., and the sluggish popularity of Tesla among new-car registrants comes at a particularly vulnerable time for Tesla as a company and for its CEO. Musk is facing significant pressure from investors who want to see him adopt the norms of a more traditional CEO, step back from his grandiose social media presence, and provide a more concrete timeline for producing an affordably priced Tesla. The company reported last week that revenues dropped 9%, which was its largest drop since 2012, while net income dropped a whopping 55% in the first quarter. Three of its top executives, including well-known insider Drew Baglino, resigned in the space of two weeks, which further rattled investors. “Californians’ love affair with electric vehicle giant Tesla may have peaked,” the CNCDA said in a statement Monday. The group tracks trends in California’s new-vehicle market, using data from Experian Automotive. The CNCDA represents California-based franchised new car and truck dealers. “The numbers don’t lie,” said Brian Maas, president of the CNCDA. “They indicate that the incredible growth that Tesla had for years has now stopped or certainly slowed in the most recent report.” The market share for battery electric vehicles fell from 21.5% in 2023, to 20.9% in the first quarter, the group found. The slowdown in sales is hard to parse, said Maas, but it could be due to the price of Teslas relative to other vehicles, issues with charging infrastructure, or that buyers who wanted to own a Tesla have already purchased the car. “Appealing to the mass market is a challenge Tesla faces,” said Maas. “Other dealers have a broader array of very competitive vehicles, so Tesla doesn’t have the EV space largely to their own like they did a few years ago.” Another factor that could be contributing to the slowdown in Tesla sales is Musk himself. According to Reuters, market-intelligence firm Caliber found consumer interest in Tesla had declined from 70% in November 2021 to just 31% in February 2024, due in part to Musk’s apparent acceptance of right-wing conspiracy theories and other polarizing political views. In California, where 47% of registered voters are Democrats compared to 24% who are Republicans, Musk’s antics may be particularly unappealing. To be sure, this is only an early indicator that Tesla’s popularity is on the decline. Tesla is still the top seller of electric vehicles in California with the Model Y, Model 3, and Model X ahead of the Chevy Bolt and the Volkswagen ID.4, but first-quarter battery electric vehicle market share dropped 6.4%. Mercedes and BMW had the largest gains of sales among battery electric vehicles in the first quarter, with Mercedes rising 3% and BMW 2.4%.",https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1948566277-e1714424198773.jpg,2024-04-29,-0.22,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Elon Musk', 'description': 'business magnate (born 1971)', 'full_name': 'Elon Musk', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Elon_Musk_Royal_Society_%28crop2%29.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Elon', 'latitude': 43.26414108276367, 'longitude': -91.32402038574219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Honda', 'latitude': 33.18333053588867, 'longitude': 130.7166748046875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Toyota', 'latitude': 35.08332824707031, 'longitude': 137.14999389648438, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Maas', 'latitude': 33.19997024536133, 'longitude': 35.98905944824219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Musk', 'latitude': 35.535301208496094, 'longitude': 46.19049835205078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reuters', 'latitude': 50.67449951171875, 'longitude': 9.351499557495117, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Model', 'latitude': 37.372779846191406, 'longitude': -104.24527740478516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mercedes', 'latitude': -33.66667175292969, 'longitude': -65.46666717529297, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",I don t know,"Tesla's Model 3 dropped to third place in California's top-selling passenger cars, with Toyota and Honda taking the lead.
