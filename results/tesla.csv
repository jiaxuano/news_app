That was wrong. What I meant to say is that he is a pompous idiot whose his head is so far up his own ass that he is legally blind. I wish him the best and hope that someday we can be friends.""I’d like to apologize to Dustin Moskowitz for calling him a “retard”. That was wrong.What I meant to say is that he is a pompous idiot whose his head is so far up his own ass that he is legally blind.I wish him the best and hope that someday we can be friends.Moskovitz had not yet addressed Musk's posts on Friday.On Wednesday, the Facebook cofounder acknowledged the gravity of his comments in his social media post.""I know I sound crazy to most people who don't follow $TSLA closely but at this point it really needs to be said,"" he wrote. ""This is Enron now, folks.""To recap the two-decade-old scandal, Enron, the energy giant, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 after it was caught using creative accounting to hide billions of dollars in debt and lying about its sources of revenue. The company's chief executives were found guilty of fraud and conspiracy in 2006.Moskovitz didn't outline detailed evidence for each of his allegations, but he did share graphs from Tesla that he claims reveal how the automaker is trying to show an increase in miles driven with FSD, Tesla's driver-assistance technology that is critical for the company's path to autonomous driving and robotaxis.The tech founder went as far as predicting that people would end up in jail.No executives at Tesla have been charged with a crime, and the company has never been found liable for consumer or securities fraud.The company has faced lawsuits and probes from federal regulators regarding Tesla's FSD technology or Autopilot and its vehicle range, but there are no legal challenges related to the automaker misleading people about mileage usage with Tesla's driver-assistance feature.Most lawsuits have come from drivers who alleged that Tesla is misleading customers about FSD's capabilities. So far, the company has either settled or has been found not liable.On Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was investigating whether Tesla sufficiently addressed issues with the company's Autopilot software after its December recall of 2 million vehicles.Tesla is also facing a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bloomberg reported last year that federal regulators are investigating how Tesla's driver-assistance software was marketed and if Musk had any involvement in the promotion of the technology.Drivers also have accused Tesla of inflating its vehicle mile range, bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company. A judge said in March that plaintiffs will have to go through individual arbitrations.In the company's 2023 third-quarter earnings report, Tesla disclosed that the Justice Department subpoenaed the company for information related to ""vehicle range"" and other matters.Moskovitz also has long been skeptical of Elon Musk and his ventures.Last year, the Asana founder suggested that Tesla and SpaceX are overvalued and that the companies' leader is given too much credit.""The point is I don't really see these companies as dispensating impact, or at least don't give nearly as much credit to him as others do,"" Moskovitz said on Threads. ""If they were really built on outward lies, rather than just self-deceptions (rose-colored glasses), then we should really see them as scams he got away with.""Moskovitz has even called on Musk to resign from his executive role in all his companies after Musk called an antisemitic post on X the ""actual truth.""""I call on Elon Musk to resign,"" Moskovitz said on Threads last year, adding that he should resign ""(from everything).""",https://i.insider.com/6629adb623b29110d302cc60?width=1136&format=jpeg,2024-04-27,-0.885,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Facebook', 'description': 'American social media and technology company', 'full_name': 'Meta Platforms', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Meta_Platforms_Headquarters_Menlo_Park_California.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Enron', 'description': 'company', 'full_name': 'Enron', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Enron_Complex.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Asana', 'latitude': 14.437299728393555, 'longitude': 121.4490966796875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Musk', 'latitude': 35.535301208496094, 'longitude': 46.19049835205078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National Highway', 'latitude': 25.379169464111328, 'longitude': 68.33399963378906, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Elon', 'latitude': 36.102909088134766, 'longitude': -79.5066909790039, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Space', 'latitude': 51.515098571777344, 'longitude': -0.1912900060415268, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",I don t know,Not-related content

The billionaire entrepreneur compared Tesla to Enron, the energy and commodity company that was bankrupted in 2001 following one of the biggest accounting frauds in history. “I know I sound crazy to most people who don't follow $TSLA closely but at this point it really needs to be said. This is Enron now, folks,” Moskovitz wrote in a post, referring to a graph generated by Tesla AI, celebrating 1 billion miles for its autonomous driving solution FSD. “It may keep going, but people are going to jail at the end. The data is presented in fraudulent ways, and it doesn't say what they claim it says even when they make it up.” “Tesla has committed consumer fraud on a massive scale, from lying about FSD, ranges, and (recently, unconfirmed!) even inflating odometers,” Moskovitz continued. “Many times now, also securities fraud.” In a separate post, Moskovitz raised concerns and suspicions about the accuracy and transparency of Tesla's reporting related to its FSD technology. Specifically, he pointed out that Tesla's updated investor graph is vague about specific dates in March 2024, which raises questions about the timing of the inflection point in the graph relative to a milestone of achieving 1 billion miles driven with FSD. “The new graph is humorously ambiguous wrt dates. Is ""March 2024"" the 1st? The 31st? Why is the inflection *after* the 1B miles milestone in the new graph?” he said. Moskovitz highlighted that the free FSD trial started on March 25, and “incidentally it ends just after we get to see the cumulative FSD update, how strange,” he noted. His remarks imply a potential manipulation of usage stats to artificially boost the data, making FSD adoption appear more rapid.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/MetaPlatforms_800x533_L_1637446023.jpg,2024-04-26,-0.293,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Facebook', 'description': 'American social media and technology company', 'full_name': 'Meta Platforms', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Meta_Platforms_Headquarters_Menlo_Park_California.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Enron', 'description': 'company', 'full_name': 'Enron', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Enron_Complex.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Asana', 'latitude': 14.437299728393555, 'longitude': 121.4490966796875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Dustin Moskovitz, co-founder of Facebook and Asana, accused Tesla of ""massive fraud"" in a post on Threads, comparing it to Enron.

Baglino, who joined Tesla in 2006, is selling about 1.14 million of his shares, the filing said, listing an ""approximate date of sale"" of April 25, and describing it as an exercise of stock options. Tesla announced on April 15 that it's laying off 10% of its global workforce, following a drop in first-quarter deliveries and a steep slide in the stock price. That day, Baglino and fellow company veteran Rohan Patel said they were leaving the company. Baglino announced his departure in a statement posted to X. ""I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday,"" he wrote. ""I am so thankful to have worked with and learned from the countless incredibly talented people at Tesla over the years."" Baglino began as an engineer and climbed the ranks, most recently serving as senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, a job he'd held since 2016. Reporting directly to Musk, Baglino was seen as the unofficial chief of operations by many colleagues. Prior to the latest sale, Baglino had unloaded about $4 million worth of shares in two transactions this year — one in late February and the other in early April, filings show. In each case, he sold 10,500 shares, exercising stock options in both. During earnings calls and other major company events, including a presentation of Tesla's ""Master Plan part 3"" in the spring of 2023, Baglino had become a familiar voice and face to shareholders, often discussing mining, battery manufacturing and performance. Baglino didn't respond to requests for comment. Tesla also didn't provide a comment. Baglino's resigned as Tesla appeared to embark on a major strategic shift. Musk said on the company's earnings call this week that while Tesla still intends to produce affordable, new model electric cars in 2025, investors should focus more on Tesla's ""autonomy roadmap."" Tesla said it plans to unveil a robotaxi, or CyberCab, design on Aug. 8. Musk also touted Tesla's investments in AI infrastructure and the company's potential to finally deliver self-driving vehicle technology, robotaxis, a driverless ride-hailing service, and a ""sentient"" humanoid robot. He even told doubters to stay away from the stock. ""If somebody doesn't believe Tesla's going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,"" Musk said on the call. Tesla's share price, which was down about 40% for the year prior to the earnings report, jumped 18% in the two trading days after Musk's commentary, closing on Thursday at $170.18.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107405929-1713984199208-gettyimages-2150015827-dji_20240416150931_0155_d_hx8dnrxe.jpeg?v=1713984349,2024-04-26,-0.34,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tesla', 'latitude': 38.60205078125, 'longitude': -80.70343017578125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SEC', 'latitude': 45.75471878051758, 'longitude': 14.853890419006348, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Musk', 'latitude': 35.535301208496094, 'longitude': 46.19049835205078, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",I don t know,"Former Tesla executive Drew Baglino sold $181.5 million worth of Tesla shares after announcing his resignation.

Tesla has been utilizing the expertise of PepsiCo. for an early pilot program involving the Semi to test real-world efficiency and travel. For the past two years, Tesla and PepsiCo. have been working to understand how the vehicle will make fleets more efficient and environmentally friendly as the truck is still making its way toward volume production. However, the Semi launch has been pushed back on several occasions, but executives on Tesla’s Q1 2024 Earnings Call on Tuesday gave a timeline of when they believe the hauling vehicle will be available for more deliveries: “Our first vehicles are planned for late 2025 of external customers starting in 2026.” The thing that has held up production is Tesla’s want for a more affordable and efficient manufacturing process. Additionally, Tesla’s Semi production facility, which is currently being built in Nevada near Tesla Gigafactory, is also being constructed: “So we’re finalizing the engineering of the Semi to enable like a super cost-effective high volume production with our learnings from our fleet and pilot fleet and Pepsi’s fleet, which we’re expanding this year marginally. In parallel as we showed in the shareholder’s deck, we have started construction on the factory in Reno.” Tesla also showed the land where the Semi production facility will be and the progress of the construction: Tesla broke ground on the site in January after announcing the $3.6 billion project nearly a year to the day: The Semi is one of the biggest developments in Tesla’s current pipeline, as it will help the company obtain a vehicle that is primarily dedicated to fleets and logistics.
