This prevented First Republic from being put into receivership under the FDIC, as had happened with the failed Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in mid-March. It also prevents authorities from implementing emergency measures as they did for the other two to shore up the US banking sector. However, late last year, JP Morgan Chase announced the closure of twenty-two First Republic branches, bringing the total down to 62. These closures had been reported earlier that year as executives at JP Morgan began to evaluate the health of the bank they had acquired and the changes that would need to be made to bring the bank back into the green as it was integrated into their operations. JP Morgan Chase identified the initial branches selected for closure as “locations that have relatively low transaction volumes and are generally within a short drive from another First Republic office,” according to a statement provided by the bank. Last week, data published by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reported nine additional closures. No timeline has been placed on when these locations will shutter their doors, but thanks to data from the federal agency that oversees these processes and many others, we know they are coming. Where are the branches closing? All affected branches are located in California, with the majority found in the Bay Area, in and around San Fransisco. The closures will affect a total of nine branches: With these closures, the number of First Republic branches will fall to fifty-three. Over time, all of these branches will be absorbed into the Chase ecosystem and be rebranded to avoid confusion.",https://img.asmedia.epimg.net/resizer/v2/YLWF5GEY7RPU6TOCNXQWJFPRTA.jpg?auth=d559198a3e7a21d7d92ea53cb91d2fe530fa5608a1d1d220b39db9f93087d04d&width=1472&height=828&focal=2914%2C698,2024-02-28,-0.226,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bay', 'latitude': 38.50838088989258, 'longitude': -91.55850219726562, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Fransisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chase', 'latitude': 36.54169845581055, 'longitude': -104.9255599975586, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"JP Morgan acquired First Republic Bank last year, preventing its receivership.

An activist group, led by insurance executive George Norcross, lawyer Philip Norcross and former TD Bank CEO Greg Braca, said this week that it would call off a planned investment in the beleaguered Republic First. The drawn-out and often contentious saga involving Republic First Bancorp in Philadelphia and an activist group hit another twist this week. A planned capital raise fell through. The Norcross-Braca group — led by insurance executive George Norcross, lawyer Philip Norcross and former TD Bank CEO Greg Braca — had for the past two years complained of the $6 billion-asset Republic First's substandard profitability and stock performance. The activist investor had pushed for management and board changes, among other efforts for strategic shifts and transparency, and ultimately last September announced a deal to invest at least $35 million in common stock and securities in the bank. That plan, had it come to fruition, would have bolstered Republic First's capital position and ended a lengthy Norcross-Braca proxy contest. However, the deal required the bank to first raise $40 million from third-party investors, issue a long-delayed 10-K regulatory filing for 2022 and hold an annual meeting with shareholders. In a statement issued late Wednesday, the Norcross-Braca group cited the bank's ""failure"" to ""take actions and satisfy closing conditions,"" including filing the 10-K and hosting the meeting, as reasons to terminate the deal. The group noted the deadline for completion of the deal had previously been extended from Nov. 30 to today. The group did not provide more detail and said it would not comment further on the nixed agreement. The Norcross-Braca group has wrestled for control of Republic First since early 2022. Republic First, the parent of Republic Bank, did not delve into detail either. But it confirmed the deal was canceled in a regulatory filing and provided an emailed statement to American Banker noting that it was not reliant on the Norcross-Braca capital raise. ""Our strategic plan has been designed to be executed even without the investment announced last fall. We have continued to maintain the bank's adequately capitalized position, and believe we have a strong deposit base and ample liquidity,"" Republic First said. ""As previously disclosed,"" the company added, ""we engaged Wolf & Company for 2022, 2023 and 2024 to support us in getting current with our annual and periodic financial reporting obligations and believe this is key for us and investors in considering opportunities for growth capital in the future."" Republic First has made multiple attempts to raise capital over the past year and shore up its finances. These included an early 2023 plan to raise a total of $125 million in partnership with Castle Creek that was later canceled. Community banking Republic First got a hand up from investors. Is it out of the woods? October 31, 2023 4:07 PM These efforts followed infighting on the bank's board and changes in leadership. Current President and CEO Thomas Geisel joined Republic First in December 2022 to lead a turnaround. Last year, he announced plans to quit originating mortgages, streamline commercial lending in New York and curb expenses elsewhere. In a statement late last year, Geisel said ""our team continues to work on making sustainable process and operational efficiency improvements, while maintaining Republic Bank's focus on providing a high level of service and responsiveness for our customers and communities."" Republic First posted a fourth-quarter loss of $42.7 million, according to its latest call report. For the quarter ended Sept. 30 of last year, the company reported a loss of $29.8 million.

Banks are still grappling with fallout of SVB's failure one year on - Marketplace,Banks are still grappling with fallout of SVB's failure one year on  Marketplace,"Mon, 11 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHBsYWNlLm9yZy8yMDI0LzAzLzExL2Jhbmtpbmctc3lzdGVtLXNpbGljb24tdmFsbGV5LXNpZ25hdHVyZS1iYW5rLWZhaWx1cmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Marketplace,"One year ago Sunday, Silicon Valley Bank failed. Two days later, Signature Bank collapsed. And later in the spring, First Republic Bank failed as well. Government intervention played a big role in containing the fallout from the collapses. But one year on, the banking system is still feeling a lot of reverberations. The whole banking system was caught off guard by the problems at the three midsized institutions — especially regulators, said Kathryn Judge, a law professor at Columbia University. But now? “We have regulators who are on high alert for the possibility of problems and are actively working to try to make sure they understand where sources of fragility might exist,” she said. For instance, the Federal Reserve said it’s been keeping a closer eye on commercial real estate loans since many have been showing signs of stress. There are also proposals to beef up the cushion banks have to carry to absorb losses. Overall, Judge said that regulators have learned that big banks aren’t the only ones that can threaten the financial system. “Banks the size of Signature Bank or Silicon Valley Bank have the potential to be systemically significant in a way that are going to require extraordinary action by regulators in connection with their failures,” she said. But even though the banking system is more stable now, a lot of the problems that were revealed a year ago haven’t gone away. A big one is the pressure banks face when interest rates rise, according to David Schiff, head of retail and consumer banking at West Monroe. “High interest rates, particularly the longer they stay high, mean greater operating costs, mean greater uncertainty on the balance sheet, both on the deposit side and on the lending side,” Schiff said. On the lending side, a lot of banks’ cash is tied up in loans they made back when interest rates were low. But on the deposit side, banks are paying their customers higher interest rates to keep them from running to the competition. “Banks are really struggling, particularly with small businesses, commercial institutions and high net-worth customers that have greater degrees of deposits, to prove out that the relationship is really worth it,” he said. And banks are trying other ways of keeping depositors happy. Dominik Mjartan, CEO of Optus Bank in South Carolina, said that his bank’s been looking at cutting fees for services like wire transfers and fraud protection. “We frequently have to say, ‘To win your relationship, to show you that we’re a good relationship bank, you know, we’re going to do that for very little or nothing,'” he said. Mjartan’s bank makes a lot of loans in low- and moderate-income communities. Lately, he’s been going to big banks and saying, “Hey, you want to help those communities too. So why don’t you deposit some money with us?” That strategy’s been working out. “We pay them interest on it. We send them statements. The money’s insured. We agree on a term. And I’m hoping that they continue to reinvest those funds with us every time it matures,” Mjartan said. Those deposits are allowing the bank to continue making new loans at a time when other lenders have been pulling back, he said.",https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1472600143-e1709917085248.jpg?fit=2880%2C1622&w=1200,2024-03-11,-0.275,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'David Schiff', 'description': 'composer', 'full_name': 'David Schiff'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Kathryn', 'latitude': 37.87594985961914, 'longitude': -80.97425842285156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Columbia University', 'latitude': 40.808990478515625, 'longitude': -73.96125030517578, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Judge', 'latitude': 38.42060089111328, 'longitude': -91.78073120117188, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'West Monroe', 'latitude': 32.51847839355469, 'longitude': -92.14763641357422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Schiff', 'latitude': 51.00299072265625, 'longitude': 7.1739702224731445, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'South Carolina', 'latitude': 34.000431060791016, 'longitude': -81.00009155273438, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hey', 'latitude': 51.89332962036133, 'longitude': 4.420829772949219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

JPMorgan's First Republic Makeover Bucks Branch Closure Trend - PYMNTS.com,JPMorgan's First Republic Makeover Bucks Branch Closure Trend  PYMNTS.com,"Mon, 11 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9iYW5raW5nLzIwMjMvanBtb3JnYW5zLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLW1ha2VvdmVyLWJ1Y2tzLWJyYW5jaC1jbG9zdXJlLXRyZW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,PYMNTS.com,"JPMorgan is reportedly overhauling branches acquired in the collapse of First Republic Bank. The country’s largest bank is planning to open several new branches, Reuters reported Monday (Dec. 11), going against a nationwide trend as consumers shift to digital banking. “Branches have been a winning strategy for us that is helping us capture more market share,” Jennifer Roberts, CEO of Chase Consumer Banking, said in an interview with Reuters. She added that 75% of the bank’s depositors visit a branch at least once a year. JPMorgan has more than 4,800 branches in the continental U.S., and plans to open another 167 by the year’s end, more than its earlier projection of 150, Roberts said. Reuters noted that Bank of America is also adding new branches, a reversal from a nationwide decline. American banks shuttered 123 branches and opened 80 in October, bringing the number of active bank branches at the end of that month to 77,690, the report said, citing data from S&P. And as PYMNTS wrote recently, bank earnings this quarter have suggested “some critical mass as consumers continue to use online channels to conduct at least some aspects of daily financial life.” Earnings calls for banks that include JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo show that “the branch experience itself is changing, and is being reinvented to fit more fully into an omnichannel effort to meet consumers where they want to be met,” that report said. This fall has also seen reports that bank branches in supermarkets were shutting down at a rate that is seven times higher than that of other branches. Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) showed American banks closed 10.7% of their in-store branches in the year ended June 30, and just 1.4% for other branches during the same time frame. The FDIC took over First Republic in May and sold the company’s operations to JPMorgan, following what was the second-biggest banking collapse seen since the financial crisis of 2008. When JPMorgan acquired First Republic, it added 84 branches, though it later announced plans to close 21 of those locations. “Even though there could be some branch network consolidations, the total number of new branches would be higher and you will see our branch network growing,” Roberts said.",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/first-republic-bank-3.jpg,2023-12-11,-0.402,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Citigroup', 'description': 'American investment bank and financial services corporation', 'full_name': 'Citigroup', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/388_Greenwich_Street_from_Battery_Park_City_North_Esplanade.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reuters', 'latitude': 50.67449951171875, 'longitude': 9.351499557495117, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chase', 'latitude': 36.54169845581055, 'longitude': -104.9255599975586, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Roberts', 'latitude': 42.42692184448242, 'longitude': -94.17440795898438, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank of America', 'latitude': 37.79444122314453, 'longitude': -122.40306091308594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"JPMorgan acquired 84 branches from First Republic Bank after its collapse.

In a report Friday, the FDIC found fault in how regulators in the FDIC’s San Francisco Office dealt with First Republic Bank in the years leading up to its collapse in May. Regulators ""could have been more forward-looking"" in assessing the risks that rising interest rates would pose to the bank, ""could have done more"" to challenge and encourage bank management to manage those risks, and were ""too generous"" in evaluating whether the bank had enough liquid assets on hand, according to the report. The FDIC is one of the government bodies regulating banks, alongside the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency. The FDIC’s report echoes the findings of an earlier Federal Reserve report, which found flaws in the regulatory oversight of Silicon Valley Bank before it imploded in a million-dollar-per-second bank run. SVB’s failure in March set off a chain of events that led to the collapse of First Republic. The FDIC report identified several factors that prompted the bank run that ultimately brought down First Republic: The bank grew too fast, and it relied too much on uninsured deposits and loyalty from depositors. Furthermore, during the easy-money years of the pandemic, when interest rates were ultra-low, the bank failed to prepare for what would happen if rates shot up again. That risk blew up in First Republic’s face after the Federal Reserve rapidly cranked up its benchmark interest rate beginning in March 2022 to control inflation. High interest rates reduced the value of many of First Republic’s assets, shaking depositors' confidence and inflaming the fears that led to the fatal bank run. ""We cannot say whether taking earlier supervisory action such as criticizing interest rate risk or liquidity risk management would have prevented First Republic from failing given the significance and speed of deposit withdrawals,"" the FDIC said in the report. ""However, meaningful action to mitigate interest rate risk and address funding concentrations would have made the bank more resilient and less vulnerable to the March 2023 contagion event.""Regulators have proposed a slew of rule changes in response to First Republic's and other banks' failure this spring, including requiring banks to have more of a financial buffer against losses to guard against bank runs and other risks.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/yWJIndW1MVUbIF1c8cgWXxKRjrY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1495191906-38f8c68a74644a7d96cc14f9632c3fcc.jpg,2023-09-11,-0.255,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"The FDIC report found that regulators could have been more proactive in assessing risks to First Republic Bank, which collapsed due to rapid growth, reliance on uninsured deposits, and failure to prepare for rising interest rates.

1st Century Hires Former First Republic Bankers - Los Angeles Business Journal,1st Century Hires Former First Republic Bankers  Los Angeles Business Journal,"Mon, 16 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvMXN0LWNlbnR1cnktaGlyZXMtZm9ybWVyLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLWJhbmtlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Los Angeles Business Journal,"Another bank has moved in on the clientele left shaken by the regional banking crisis. 1st Century Bancorp Inc., a division of Midland Financial Co., the holding company for the largest private bank in the country, MidFirst Bank, is expanding into new markets by hiring 22 former First Republic bankers. Former First Republic regional managing directors will open 1st Century branches in the South Bay, Santa Barbara and San Diego, and the bank hopes their existing client networks will trust a new, private employer after their former bank sustained a disastrous public bank run this March. In addition to top directors overseeing new outposts statewide, 1st Century also brings in new vice presidents and an executive, who will work out of its Century City headquarters. According to 1st Century’s founder and president, Jason DiNapoli, the company has been eyeing expansion for a long time but needed a market opening to justify the cost of growth. With public banks hunkering down under shareholder pressure in an uncertain market, 1st Century found its moment. “A lot of banks have sort of stopped or maybe retreated,” DiNapoli said. “We see this as an opportunity to grow.” Another player recently encroached on the West Coast wealthy both First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank left searching for new wealth-management options. Last month, First Citizens Bancshares Inc., the acquirer of Silicon Valley’s assets, announced 11 wealth advisors had moved into the Los Angeles area targeting growing-net-worth individuals. According to 1st Century’s announcement, the bank looks to attract the same high net-worth deposits that both built and depleted First Republic Bank. The deposits, often well over the $250,000 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. limit for protection, came from clients like entrepreneurs, real estate investors and private equity players. While this customer base grew its wealth management practice to $271.2 billion in assets in 2022, the same high-profile clientele withdrew more than $100 billion within a matter of days following Silicon Valley’s collapse in March. This run drained the bank’s last-minute bailout from the private sector and spurred what is now the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. Earl Crawford, who served as a senior credit officer on the First Republic executive loan committee, now works out of Century City as 1st Century’s credit executive. It was this loan committee that approved First Republic’s large loan campaign while interest rates were low during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. When interest rates jumped last year the value of these loans dropped, scrapping the chance a capital raise could shore up its balance sheet. DiNapoli believes the bankers he hired did their job well at First Republic and can salvage potential broken trust through the reassurance that his bank’s private status remains immune to public market panic. “Being private, being out of the news cycle, really made sure we didn’t have the same problems,” DiNapoli said. Prior to its collapse, First Republic had an expansive network in Los Angeles. The bank had $12.8 billion in deposits in Los Angeles County last year, according to Business Journal rankings. This exceeded Midfirst Bank’s size nearly seven-fold, as 1st Century’s parent company reported $1.9 billion in deposits in the local area last year. Midfirst acquired 1st Century in 2016, after the latter grew to a $732 million entity while public on the New York Stock Exchange. 1st Century still operates five branches under its name throughout Los Angeles County. Lyndsey Hudgins and Linnea McArt joined 1st Century to grow the Los Angeles deposit effort in Century City after long stints as relationship managers for First Republic.",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PG10_DDMLEDE_1stCentury_1016-copy.jpg,2023-10-17,-0.015,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'MidFirst Bank', 'description': 'Bank in Oklahoma', 'full_name': 'MidFirst Bank'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Midland', 'latitude': 31.997350692749023, 'longitude': -102.07791137695312, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Century', 'latitude': 39.0997200012207, 'longitude': -80.18860626220703, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'South Bay', 'latitude': 52.28388977050781, 'longitude': -6.353330135345459, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Santa Barbara', 'latitude': 34.42082977294922, 'longitude': -119.69818878173828, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Diego', 'latitude': 32.715328216552734, 'longitude': -117.15725708007812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Century City', 'latitude': 34.05556869506836, 'longitude': -118.41786193847656, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DiNapoli', 'latitude': 41.309539794921875, 'longitude': -73.45707702636719, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'West Coast', 'latitude': -25.0, 'longitude': 122.0, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Silicon Valley', 'latitude': 37.369998931884766, 'longitude': -122.04000091552734, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Los Angeles', 'latitude': 34.05223083496094, 'longitude': -118.24368286132812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Los Angeles County', 'latitude': 34.366661071777344, 'longitude': -118.20091247558594, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York Stock Exchange', 'latitude': 40.70677185058594, 'longitude': -74.0112533569336, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"First Republic Bank, hit by a disastrous bank run in March, has lost 22 bankers to 1st Century Bancorp Inc., a division of Midland Financial Co.

Miklos Daniel Brody, 38, pleaded guilty in April 2023 to two charges that he violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by obtaining information from a protected computer and by intentionally damaging a protected computer and one charge of making false statements to a government agency, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California said in a statement. According to prosecutors, Brody worked as a cloud engineer for First Republic Bank, which is headquartered in San Francisco, until March 2020 when he was fired for violating company policy. Based on a superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury in December 2022, he used his company-issued laptop -- which he did not return after being fired -- to access the bank's computer network to cause substantial damage. Prosecutors said Brody deleted the bank's code repositories, ran a malicious script to delete logs, left taunts within the bank's code for ex-colleagues, and impersonated other bank employees by opening sessions in their names. The superseding indictment also noted that he emailed himself a proprietary bank code that he had worked on as an employee valued at over $5,000. According to prosecutors, the total cost of the damage to the bank's systems is at least $220,621. in the days and weeks that followed his firing, Brody also filed a police report, lying to the San Francisco Police Department that his company-issued laptop was stolen from his car while he was working out at a gym.

Former First Republic Bank executives under FDIC investigation - Yahoo Finance,Former First Republic Bank executives under FDIC investigation  Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 02 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3JtZXItZmlyc3QtcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1leGVjdXRpdmVzLTExNDIwMTQxMC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance,"First Republic Bank executives are under investigation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for potential misconduct, Reuters reported. ""We can confirm a [directors and officers] probe into First Republic is taking place,"" an FDIC spokesperson told Reuters Wednesday. The regulator did not provide additional details and has not returned Banking Dive’s request for comment. This marks No. 3 for investigations into the bank failures that cost the FDIC $32 billion this year, adding to a list that includes Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Those investigations were announced in March. The FDIC did not respond to an inquiry from Banking Dive on where those investigations stand now. First Republic’s May failure was the third domino to fall this spring, after SVB and Signature’s respective failures on March 10 and March 12. Former CEO Michael Roffler told the House Financial Services Committee in May that contagion caused his bank to fail. “Up until the cataclysmic events of March 10 … First Republic was in a strong financial position with strong investment grade ratings aligned with the nation’s largest banks,” Roffler said at the time. Eleven large U.S. banks infused First Republic with $30 billion early in the banking crisis, but it was ultimately seized by the FDIC May 1 and sold to JPMorgan Chase. The transaction was heavily criticized by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, who questioned regulators’ decision to pick JPMorgan as First Republic’s buyer. “The net result of these machinations is that, without a complete regulatory review, and at a cost of $13 billion to the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the nation’s biggest bank — already too big to fail — got a bargain deal on a failing bank that made it even bigger,” she wrote. “This is a troubling outcome, leaving me with numerous questions.” The FDIC is now investigating if First Republic executives and board members failed to act in their bank’s best interests, Reuters reported. Federal law allows the FDIC to ban former directors and officers from the banking industry if they are found to have made decisions with ""willful or continuing disregard"" for a bank’s best interests. The FDIC can also impose fines on these individuals. Roffler and former First Republic Executive Chairman James Herbert could not be reached by Reuters for comment.

This came amid stress on the financial sector sparked by a bank run in March that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a Sunnyvale institution picked up by First Citizens Bank. Stress on banks with a number of deposits above its limit of $250,000 led to the FDIC revisiting its rules. JPMorgan in early summer said it would shutter 21 First Republic locations by year-end, Reuters reported June 1. The remaining First Republic locations will be rebranded as JPMorgan. First Republic’s Mill Valley office occupied 2,847 square feet of Strawberry Village, according to space specifications posted by Edens. The Washington, D.C., retail real estate investment company purchased the 175,000-square-foot center a year ago and started renovations of the property in June of this year.

JPMorgan (JPM) Completes 14 First Republic Branch Closures - Yahoo Finance,JPMorgan (JPM) Completes 14 First Republic Branch Closures  Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 25 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qcG1vcmdhbi1qcG0tY29tcGxldGVzLTE0LWZpcnN0LTE2MDgwMDUwMS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance,"JPMorgan Chase JPM has shut down 14 First Republic Bank branches in California. With this, the Wall Street giant completes its initial plans to trim the failed bank’s branch network following its takeover this May.Of the total branches that have been shut, half were in San Francisco County and the rest were spread across six other counties in California.JPMorgan had initially planned to shut down 21 First Republic branches by the end of 2023. With the latest closures, the target has been met.The shutdowns represent one-quarter of the total 84 branches that First Republic operated at the end of April 2023.Earlier this year, JPM said that the 21 branches selected for closure had “relatively low transaction volumes and are generally within a short drive from another First Republic office.”While the remaining 63 branches are likely to be rebranded as Chase branches, more branch closures may take place.Jennifer Piepszak, the co-CEO of consumer and community banking, had said during JPM’s May investor day that the remaining First Republic branches will either stay open because they are in better locations than nearby Chase branches or they will be closed due to their proximity to an existing Chase office. Details of the First Republic Takeover On May 1, JPM acquired failed First Republic Bank to become an even bigger financial behemoth. JPM bought the bulk of First Republic’s $228 billion of assets and assumed deposits worth $92 billion by paying $10.6 billion. The company did not acquire any of the First Republic’s corporate debt or preferred stock.At the time of the acquisition, JPMorgan expected the transaction to generate more than $500 million of “incremental net income” annually.Also, the financial giant expected the deal to result in increased penetration within the high-net-worth clients.Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan, said, “This acquisition modestly benefits our company overall, it is accretive to shareholders, it helps further advance our wealth strategy, and it is complementary to our existing franchise.”After almost two months of efforts to save the flagging institution, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) seized First Republic in May. The nation’s biggest banks, including JPMorgan, had tried to support the San Francisco-based lender by infusing $30 billion worth of deposits (in aggregate). Despite the infusion, deposits continued to exit the company and by the end of April, there were only a few options left to save it.The failure of First Republic Bank followed the collapse of two other major banks — Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank — and led to the regional banking industry turmoil in the United States. Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank were seized by the FDIC and then sold to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. NYCB and First Citizens BancShares, Inc. FCNCA, respectively.NYCB, through its bank subsidiary, Flagstar Bank, acquired $38 billion in assets and assumed $36 billion of liabilities of Signature Bank, while not buying any digital asset banking, crypto-related assets or the fund banking business. FCNCA assumed Silicon Valley Bank’s assets worth $110 billion, deposits worth $56 billion and loans worth $72 billion. Conclusion Over the past few years, JPMorgan has undertaken several on-bolt acquisitions that have supported its fee income base and improved market share across several products and services.Also, the bank is expanding its footprint in new regions. In 2018, JPM announced plans to enter 25 new markets by opening 400 new branches. The company has made substantial progress on this front, with a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states.In addition to enhancing market share, the strategy will help the bank grab cross-selling opportunities by increasing its presence in the card and auto loan sectors.Over the past six months, shares of JPMorgan have rallied 13.4% compared with the industry’s rise of 2.7%.

The message says suspicious activity has been detected in your account; it wants you to click a link to verify your identity. You panic. You want to resolve the issue immediately, and so you click on the link and input your personal information. Next thing you know, a stranger has access to your bank account. Text-message phishing scams (also called ""smishing"") are becoming more sophisticated. Cybercriminals now have easy access to AI, which can be used to craft plausible messages from supposedly trustworthy sources such as your bank. The FBI's latest Internet Crime Report found that 298,878 complains of phishing scams in 2023 resulted in almost $19 million in loses. While fraudulent texts are dangerous scams, authentic notifications from banks can be useful for letting you know when you have a low funds in your checking account or a high credit card balance. How can you tell if a text message from your bank is real? Read on for tips to detect fake text messages and how to report phishing scams if you get hit by one. For more money tips, learn the best time to fly for cheap plane tickets and how to stop tax-related identity theft. What's the first thing to do if you get a text from ""your bank?"" First, stop to consider if you've consented to receive text messages from your bank. Melanie McGovern, director of PR and social media at Better Business Bureau, tells CNET, ""there are banks that will text, and if you've opted in, they're going to text you."" If you're not sure whether you've agreed to receive texts from your bank, log on to your bank account from its official website, and check your communications preferences via your personal profile or settings. The setting for text messages could be under ""Delivery Settings,"" ""Alerts,"" or ""Notifications."" If you haven't enabled text notifications, be suspicious: The message purportedly from your bank is almost certainly a scam, and you should report it to your bank and the FTC (see below). If you have enabled text notifications, you'll need to go further to determine whether the text message is legitimate. How can I tell if a text message from my bank is legit? If you have agreed to receive text messages from your bank, there is a list of red flags that can help determine whether a banking related text is legitimate. First, banks will never ask for personal or confidential information via text messages. If a message wants to know your PIN code, online credentials or other account information, ignore the message and report it to your bank and the Federal Trade Commission. Most banks take care to explain their policies on a security or privacy page. Bank of America says that it will ""never text, email or call you asking for personal or account information."" Banks will also not ask you to verify your identity by clicking a link. Second, watch for claims of urgency. Scam messages often try to scare people by indicating they need to act quickly to avoid disaster. McGovern says, ""they're expecting you to panic and act immediately. Especially if you see a bank name."" Third, be wary of links that are similar to your bank's official website but slightly different, such as having an extra hyphen or using the .info domain extension instead of .com. Smishing messages might also ask you to send money or make purchases -- banks will never ask you to transfer money via text message. Also watch out for messages that seem too good to be true -- your bank won't send you a prize announcement for a contest you didn't even know you entered. The educational website Banks Never Ask That (sponsored by the American Bankers Association) includes more tips for avoiding banking-related smishing scams. How should I respond to a text message that looks like it's from my bank? No matter what the message from your bank says, it's best to contact your bank directly before doing anything. McGovern says you should ""call your bank directly from the number on the back of your card or the number on their official website, not the number that texted you."" She also advises to ""never click on the link that they send."" You should always be able to reach any necessary URLs via your regular bank website. In fact, there's no need to engage with any text messages from your bank. You should be able to accomplish any necessary tasks by calling your bank or visiting its website. What should I do if I've received a text message for a banking scam? First, take a screenshot of the text message for reporting purposes and then delete the message -- you don't want to accidentally engage with it. Next, report your suspicious text message to both your bank and the FTC. If you didn't take any action on the text message, email it to your bank (see addresses below) or call them with the information. If you did interact with the text message at all, such as clicking a link or replying, be sure to call your bank's phone number for fraud or security issues ASAP. To report the phishing attempt to the FTC, simply forward the message to 7726 (SPAM). You can also report the scam using ReportFraudftc.gov. *First Republic Bank does not list an email address for reporting phishing scams on its website and has not yet replied to an email request for one Remember, there's no need to reply to or click any text messages from your bank, even when they are real. Play it safe by calling your bank or visiting its website whenever you get a text message, and you'll be sure to keep your accounts protected.

JPMorgan Chase, already the largest U.S. bank by several measures, emerged as winner of the weekend auction for First Republic. It will get all of the ailing bank's deposits and a ""substantial majority of assets,"" the New York-based bank said. The seizure of First Republic resulted in the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, when Washington Mutual imploded. Back then, it was also JPMorgan that won the failed banks' assets. Since the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, attention has focused on First Republic as the weakest link in the U.S. banking system. Like SVB, which catered to the tech startup community, First Republic was also a California-based specialty lender of sorts. It focused on serving rich coastal Americans, enticing them with low-rate mortgages in exchange for leaving cash at the bank. But that model unraveled in the wake of the SVB collapse, as First Republic clients withdrew more than $100 billion in deposits, the bank revealed in its earnings report April 24. Institutions with a high proportion of uninsured deposits found themselves vulnerable because customers feared losing savings in a bank run.

Republic First Bancorp in Philadelphia is being delisted from the Nasdaq stock market due to its failure to file a 10-K annual report for 2022 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The $6 billion-asset Republic First said in a statement Tuesday that shares would cease trading on Nasdaq and move to the OTC Pink market Wednesday while retaining the FRBK stock symbol. The OTC Markets Group is divided into three tiers with OTC Pink the least regulated. There are no filing requirements for companies that trade on the so-called Pink Sheets. Nasdaq, by contrast, requires listed companies to file annual reports within 60 to 90 days of the end of a fiscal year, depending on the proportion of shares held by public investors. Republic First cited failures by previous management teams to maintain adequate internal controls, as well as complications stemming from a systems conversion implemented in June 2022 as contributing factors in the filing delay. ""The audit process that new management and the company's external advisors had to undertake has been extensive and time consuming,"" Republic First said in the statement. While Republic First declined to provide an estimate of when it would file the 2022 annual report, the company noted it could apply to list on a major stock exchange after filing its delayed reports and meeting other filing requirements. That possibility failed to mollify investors. The stock closed down nearly 56% Tuesday at 31 cents per share. Republic First's current management team, led by CEO Thomas Geisel and Chief Financial Officer Michael Harrington, took over in December. Banking veteran Vernon Hill served as CEO from February 2021 until August 2022, when he stepped down under pressure from activist investors and a faction of Republic First's board. Regulation and compliance Regulators OK short-term accommodations for troubled CRE loans June 29, 2023 5:30 PM Republic First reported a $28 million profit for 2021 and $24.2 million for 2022, but its bottom-line results have suffered this year as different groups continued to battle for control of the company. According to its most recent Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. call report, Republic First lost $14.6 million through the first six months of 2023. Tuesday's delisting announcement comes six weeks before Republic First is scheduled to convene its 2022 annual meeting, which has been delayed by corporate and legal wrangling. A dissident investor group led by New Jersey Insurance executive George Norcross and former TD Bank CEO Greg Braca plans to seek the three contested board seats with a slate of candidates led by Braca.

It may seem a strange question to pose so shortly after the collapse of First Republic Bank, the second-largest such failure in U.S. history, but many industry experts say that its problems were unique to the once high-flying lender. Investors have also appeared to reach that view: As First Republic hurtled toward collapse, with its stock dropping precipitously, financial markets were far calmer than in mid-March, when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank provoked a panic that engulfed the industry. First Republic was seized by regulators early Monday morning and sold to JPMorgan Chase. The S&P 500 stock index barely budged in trading, and JPMorgan’s shares gained about 2 percent.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced simultaneously Monday morning that it had seized the bank and that JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in America, would be purchasing substantially all of the bank's assets and deposits. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department sought to reassure the markets and the public after First Republic, with $229.1 billion in total assets at the time of closure, eclipsed Silicon Valley Bank ($209 billion at the time of closure) to become the second-largest bank failure in American history. “The banking system remains sound and resilient, and Americans should feel confident in the safety of their deposits and the ability of the banking system to fulfill its essential function of providing credit to businesses and families,” the spokesperson said in a statement. The intervention comes days after First Republic reported losing about 40% of its deposits in the first quarter of the year. Amid rising interest rates and after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank this year, a growing cohort of depositors sought to move their money to banks seen as safer and offering more attractive returns. Among medium-sized banks, First Republic was most affected by the trend: As of mid-March, about 70% of its deposits were uninsured, according to Bank of America, meaning they were larger than the FDIC’s $250,000 guaranteed limit. That compares with a median of 55% uninsured deposits for medium-sized banks and the third-highest level after SVB and Signature Bank. Despite a $30 billion infusion from 11 peer banks in mid-March, First Republic couldn't stop the bleeding: Its stock fell more than 75% over the past 30 days. The scale of the San Francisco-based lender’s deposit losses were an outlier compared with other regional banks, which saw a roughly 5% decline in deposits on average this year, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Still, the rapid flight of deposits from First Republic had “created a lot of anxiety across the industry,” said Tim Coffey, managing director at Janney Montgomery Scott, a financial services group. In addition to the uninsured deposits, First Republic was also carrying many loans with fixed, long-term interest rates that have begun to lose value as the Federal Reserve has repeatedly hiked its benchmark rate. First Republic had said in a press release last week that it was seeking help to reshape its balance sheet after the massive deposit flight. On Friday night, the bank said: “We are engaged in discussions with multiple parties about our strategic options while continuing to serve our clients.” CNBC’s David Faber reported last Tuesday that First Republic had been looking to sell assets to larger banks while it raised additional equity, but it was unclear if other banks would be willing to buy. Bloomberg News also reported last Tuesday that First Republic was looking to sell up to $100 billion of loans and securities to restructure its balance sheet. The lender had already ruled out a full sale to another bank, Faber reported. By Friday afternoon, Reuters was reporting that an FDIC seizure was imminent after hopes of finding a private-sector solution fell through. Over the weekend, the government moved to take bids on First Republic, as the FDIC hoped to announce a closure of the firm alongside a purchase agreement. JPMorgan Chase was the winner. “Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement Monday morning. “Our financial strength, capabilities and business model allowed us to develop a bid to execute the transaction in a way to minimize costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund.” First Republic’s 84 branches in eight states will reopen Monday as branches of JPMorgan Chase. The FDIC estimates the cost of First Republic's receivership will be about $13 billion, less than the $20 billion it estimated as the cost from SVB's failure.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-05/230501-first-republic-bank-mn-1050-9873ec.jpg",2023-05-01,-0.034,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'David Faber', 'description': 'British schoolmaster and former politician', 'full_name': 'David Faber'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank of America', 'latitude': 37.79444122314453, 'longitude': -122.40306091308594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Faber', 'latitude': 34.16843032836914, 'longitude': -92.936279296875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reuters', 'latitude': 50.67449951171875, 'longitude': 9.351499557495117, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"First Republic Bank, the second-largest bank failure in US history, has been acquired by JPMorgan Chase after losing 40% of its deposits due to rising interest rates and concerns over uninsured deposits.

JPMorgan Chase to buy most First Republic assets after bank fails - CNN,JPMorgan Chase to buy most First Republic assets after bank fails  CNN,"Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8wMS9idXNpbmVzcy9maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1wdXJjaGFzZS1obmstaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wNS8wMS9idXNpbmVzcy9maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1wdXJjaGFzZS1obmstaW50bA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"JPMorgan Chase is buying most assets of First Republic Bank after the nation’s second-largest bank failure ever, in a deal announced early Monday that protects the deposits of First Republic’s customers. JPMorgan Chase said it had acquired “the substantial majority of assets” and assumed the deposits, insured and uninsured, of First Republic from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the independent government agency that insures deposits for bank customers. “Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. He said the deal is also a good one for his bank’s shareholders, adding to its expected earnings going forward. Under the deal, the FDIC will cover 80% of any losses incurred on First Republic’s portfolio of single-family residential mortgage loans and commercial loans over the next five to seven years. JPMorgan Chase also will not assume First Republic’s corporate debt, and it will receive $50 billion in financing from the FDIC to complete the deal. Under terms disclosed by JPMorgan Chase, it will make a $10.6 billion payment to the FDIC, return $25 billion in funds that other banks deposited with First Republic in March in a lifeline negotiated with Treasury at that time, and will eliminate a $5 billion deposit it had made with First Republic. JPMorgan will record a one-time gain of $2.6 billion on its books from the deal, although it expects to spend $2 billion on restructuring through the end of 2024. Besides being good news for JPMorgan Chase and First Republic’s worried customers, it was also cheered by Treasury Department officlals, who are worried about a loss of confidence in the banking system causing damage to the US economy. “Treasury is encouraged that this institution was resolved with the least cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund, and in a manner that protected all depositors,” said a Treasury Department spokesperson. “The banking system remains sound and resilient, and Americans should feel confident in the safety of their deposits and the ability of the banking system to fulfill its essential function of providing credit to businesses and families.” The FDIC took control of the embattled First Republic and then immediately announced the sale. The failure will cost the FDIC about $13 billion. That money will be paid by the nation’s banks, which pay premiums to support the agency. It is less than the $20 billion cost of the failure in March at Silicon Valley Bank, which was a bit smaller than First Republic. The FDIC conducted an auction among several banks to see which would end up with First Republic’s assets. Those bids were submitted late Sunday afternoon, a source told CNN. Then came hours of waiting for news about which bid was successful. Health of the regional banking sector The move represents the latest effort by federal regulators to prop up consumer confidence in the US banking system, which has suffered three major bank failures in the last seven weeks. Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank both were taken over by the FDIC last month following runs on those banks by their customers. The collapse of those banks sparked weeks of speculation about the health of US regional banks, especially those with a largely uninsured deposit base. Deposits at First Republic will continue to be insured by the FDIC, and “customers do not need to change their banking relationship in order to retain their deposit insurance coverage up to applicable limits,” the agency said in its statement Monday. “As part of the transaction, First Republic Bank’s 84 offices in eight states will reopen as branches of JPMorgan Chase Bank, today during normal business hours,” it noted. First Republic, which started operations in 1985 with a single San Francisco branch, is known for catering to wealthy clients in coastal states. It had assets of $229.1 billion as of April 13. As of the end of last year, it was the nation’s 14th-largest bank, according to a ranking by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States with total global assets of nearly $4 trillion as of March 31. First Republic has branches in high-income communities such as Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Santa Monica and Napa Valley, California; in addition to San Francisco, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley. Outside of California, branches are in other high-income communities such as Palm Beach, Florida; Greenwich, Connecticut; Bellevue, Washington; and Jackson, Wyoming. It had about 7,200 employees as of the end of last year. The bank’s failure comes after its stock plunged more than 97% since the problems at Silicon Valley Bank surfaced in mid-March, worrying investors about the state of the banking sector. Attempts by some larger banks to provide a $30 billion dollar lifeline proved to be insufficient to turn things around at First Republic. Its final woes kicked off early last week when the bank reported financial results that disclosed it had lost more than half of its deposits during the first quarter, not counting the infusion of cash it received from other banks. The FDIC’s rules mean that any customers with $250,000 or less in First Republic will have those funds insured by the agency. First Republic reported last week that its uninsured deposits totaled $19.8 billion, not counting $30 billion in uninsured deposits it received from other banks as part of the attempt to keep the bank afloat. Many of the bank’s customers who withdrew money during the last month were likely above that $250,000 threshold. Uninsured deposits at the bank fell by $100 billion during the course of the first quarter, a period in which total net deposits fell by $102 billion, not including the infusion of $30 billion in deposits from other banks. The uninsured deposits stood at 68% of its total deposits as of December 31, but only accounted for 27% of its non-bank deposits as of March 31. In its most recent earnings statement, the bank said insured deposits declined moderately during the quarter and have remained stable from the end of last month through April 21. Support for the banking system The infusions of cash into First Republic came after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in mid-March. The cash came from the nation’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (CBEAX), Citigroup (C) and Truist, which worked together after the intervention by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The banks agreed to keep First Republic flush, in the hopes it would provide confidence in the nation’s battered banking system. The banks and federal regulators wanted to reduce the possibility that customers of other banks would start withdrawing their cash. But while the cash allowed First Republic to make it through several weeks relatively unscathed, its Monday quarterly financial report, which disclosed massive withdrawals by the end of March, spurred new concerns about its long-term viability. Banks never have the full amount of cash on hand to cover all deposits. They instead take in deposits and use the cash to make loans or investments, such as purchasing US Treasuries. When customers lose confidence in a bank and rush to withdraw their money all at once, in what is known as a “run on the bank,” it can cause even an otherwise profitable bank to fail. First Republic’s latest earnings report showed it was still profitable in the first quarter: Its net income was $269 million, down 33% from a year earlier. But it was the news about the loss of deposits that worried investors and, eventually, regulators. While those who had more than $250,000 in their accounts were likely wealthy individuals, most were likely businesses that often need that much cash just to cover daily operating costs. A company with 100 employees can easily need more than $250,000 just to cover a biweekly payroll. First Republic’s annual report said 63% of its total deposits were from business clients, with the rest from individuals. Over the past decade, roughly 70 banks have failed, according to FDIC data, though most of those have been smaller regional lenders. But there were no failures in either 2021 or 2022. The three failures since March 10 matches the total number of bank failures in the previous 36 months from March 2020 through February 2023. Each of the recent failures involved banks with assets of more than $100 billion. The last time there was a failure of a bank with $1 billion in assets was in May 2017, when Guaranty Bank in Milwaukee went under. And the last time there was a $100 billion bank that failed was Washington Mutual in September 2008, which had $307 billion in assets, which is still the record for a US bank failure. — CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230501075144-first-republic-bank-file-042623.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-05-01,-0.167,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Citigroup', 'description': 'American investment bank and financial services corporation', 'full_name': 'Citigroup', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/388_Greenwich_Street_from_Battery_Park_City_North_Esplanade.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Washington Mutual', 'description': 'former American bank holding company', 'full_name': 'Washington Mutual', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Washington_Mutual_Tower%2C_Seattle%2C_August_2006.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CNN', 'latitude': 51.54853820800781, 'longitude': -0.09250999987125397, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Beverly Hills', 'latitude': 34.0736198425293, 'longitude': -118.40036010742188, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Brentwood', 'latitude': 37.9268684387207, 'longitude': -121.72576904296875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Santa Monica', 'latitude': 34.01945114135742, 'longitude': -118.4911880493164, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Napa Valley', 'latitude': 38.259361267089844, 'longitude': -122.28885650634766, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Los Angeles', 'latitude': 34.05223083496094, 'longitude': -118.24368286132812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Silicon Valley', 'latitude': 37.369998931884766, 'longitude': -122.04000091552734, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Palm Beach', 'latitude': 26.70561981201172, 'longitude': -80.03643035888672, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Florida', 'latitude': 28.750539779663086, 'longitude': -82.5000991821289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Greenwich', 'latitude': 41.0264892578125, 'longitude': -73.62846374511719, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Connecticut', 'latitude': 41.66704177856445, 'longitude': -72.6664810180664, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bellevue', 'latitude': 47.61037826538086, 'longitude': -122.20068359375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 38.895111083984375, 'longitude': -77.03636932373047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Jackson', 'latitude': 32.29875946044922, 'longitude': -90.18480682373047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wyoming', 'latitude': 43.000240325927734, 'longitude': -107.50090026855469, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank of America', 'latitude': 37.79444122314453, 'longitude': -122.40306091308594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'BAC', 'latitude': 45.63349151611328, 'longitude': 14.256560325622559, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Milwaukee', 'latitude': 43.03889846801758, 'longitude': -87.9064712524414, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"JPMorgan Chase acquired most assets of First Republic Bank, protecting customer deposits.

What to know about the First Republic Bank collapse - Fortune,What to know about the First Republic Bank collapse  Fortune,"Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8wMS9maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1iYW5rLWNvbGxhcHNlLWtlZXAtbW9uZXktc2FmZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fortune,"Officials announced Monday that they closed San Francisco-based First Republic Bank, making it the third U.S. bank to collapse in the past two months. Most of First Republic’s assets are being acquired by JPMorgan. First Republic had wealthy clients who rarely defaulted on their loans. But the vast majority of deposits were above the $250,000 limit set by the FDIC, meaning they were uninsured. And that worried analysts and investors who were worried that if First Republic were to fail, its customers might not get all their money back. Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which catered mostly to the tech industry, both collapsed in March under similar circumstances. The First Republic deal announced Monday means customers will be able to access all of their money, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. First Republic branches will change to JPMorgan Chase branches and First Republic customers will become JPMorgan Chase customers. Here’s what you need to know: Is my money safe? Yes, if your money is in a U.S. bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and you have less than $250,000 there. If the bank fails, you’ll get your money back. Nearly all banks are FDIC insured. You can look for the FDIC logo at bank teller windows or on the entrance to your bank branch. Credit unions are insured by the National Credit Union Administration. If you have over $250,000 in individual accounts at one bank, which most people don’t, the amount over $250,000 is considered uninsured and experts recommend that you move the remainder of your money to a different financial institution, said Caleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, a financial media website. If you have multiple individual accounts at the same bank, for example a savings account and certificate of deposit, those are added together and the total is insured up to $250,000. (Read on for more about how joint accounts are protected.) Federal officials have been taking steps to make sure other banks aren’t impacted. “You shouldn’t be too concerned about your money if it’s in one of the bigger banks, and even in some of the regional banks and the credit unions,” Silver said. Are there red flags that I should look for with my bank? If you are worried about your bank closing in the near future, there are some things you can watch out for, according to Silver: — Watch the stock price. — Keep an eye on the quarterly and annual reports from your bank. — Start a Google alert for your bank in case there are news stories about it. You want to make sure you pay close attention to the way your bank is behaving, Silver said. “If they’re trying to raise money through a share offering or if they’re trying to sell more stock, they might have trouble on their balance sheet,” said Silver. Public companies, including banks, do sell shares or issue new ones for various reasons, so context matters. First Republic did so this year when the hazards it faced were well known, and it kicked off an exodus of investors and depositors. Should I look for alternatives? If you have more than $250,000 in your bank, there are a few things you can do: — Open a joint account You can protect up to $500,000 by opening a joint account with someone else, such as your spouse, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, a financial services company. “A married couple can easily protect a million dollars at the same bank by each having an individual account and together having a joint account,” McBride said. — Move to another financial institution Moving your money to other financial institutions and having up to $250,000 in each account will ensure that your money is insured by the FDIC, McBride said. — Do not withdraw cash Despite the recent uncertainty, experts don’t recommend withdrawing cash from your account. Keeping your money in financial institutions rather than in your home is safer, especially when the amount is insured. “It’s not a time to pull your money out of the bank,” Silver said. Even people with uninsured deposits usually get nearly all of their money back. “It takes time, but generally all depositors — both insured and uninsured — get their money back,” said Todd Phillips, a consultant and former attorney at the FDIC. “Uninsured depositors may have to wait some time, and may have to take haircut where they lose 10 to 15% of their savings, but it’s never zero.” How long does it take for insured money to be available if a bank fails? Historically, the FDIC says it has returned insured deposits within a few days of a bank closing. The FDIC will either provide that amount in a new account at another insured bank or issue a check. How much money can be insured in joint accounts? If you have a joint account, the FDIC covers each individual up to $250,000. You can have both joint and single accounts at the same bank and be insured for each. So if a couple each has individual accounts and a joint account where they have equal withdrawal rights, they can each have up to $250,000 insured in their single accounts and up to $250,000 in their joint accounts. That means each of them will have up to $500,000 insured. What about other investments? Customers should take a close look at the types of investments they have in their bank to know how much of their assets are insured by the FDIC. The FDIC offers an Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator, a tool to know how much of your money is insured per financial institution. FDIC deposit insurance covers: — Checking accounts — Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts — Savings accounts — Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs) — Certificates of Deposit (CDs) — Cashier’s checks — Money orders — Other official items issued by an insured bank FDIC deposit insurance doesn’t cover: — Stock investments — Bond investments — Mutual funds — Life insurance policies — Annuities — Municipal securities — Safe deposit boxes or their contents — U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, or notes — Crypto assets How does a credit union compare to a bank? Both credit unions and banks allow customers to open savings and checking accounts, among other financial products. The key difference is that credit unions are not-for-profit institutions, which tends to translate into lower fees and lower balance requirements, while banks are for-profit. Sometimes it also means that it’s easier for credit union customers to be approved for loans, McBride said. Usually, customers are allowed to join credit unions based on where they live or work. Credit unions serve a smaller number of customers, which also allows for a more personalized experience. The tradeoff is that banks tend to have larger staff, more physical branches and newer technology. When it comes to the safety of customer’s money, both banks and credit unions insure up to $250,000 per individual customer. While banks are insured by the FDIC, credit unions are insured by the NCUA. “Whether at a bank or a credit union, your money is safe. There’s no need to worry about the safety or access to your money,” McBride said.",https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AP23118532424019-e1682949714268.jpg,2023-05-01,-0.024,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Investopedia', 'description': 'website', 'full_name': 'Investopedia', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/InvestopediaLogo.png'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Mutual', 'description': 'former radio broadcasting network', 'full_name': 'Mutual Broadcasting System'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 42.950538635253906, 'longitude': -91.28929901123047, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Union', 'latitude': 10.0408296585083, 'longitude': 124.52278137207031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Caleb', 'latitude': 33.53667068481445, 'longitude': -116.01499938964844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Silver', 'latitude': 34.534820556640625, 'longitude': -93.51019287109375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'McBride', 'latitude': 35.51810073852539, 'longitude': -101.49405670166016, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CDs', 'latitude': 51.31583023071289, 'longitude': -0.13787999749183655, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S. Treasury', 'latitude': 33.32728958129883, 'longitude': -107.71475982666016, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"First Republic Bank, known for its wealthy clientele, has failed, becoming the third U.S. bank to collapse in recent months.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) briefly took control of First Republic over the weekend, before overseeing the sale in what it describes as a ""highly competitive bidding process."" JPMorgan said in a press release it would take over First Republic's deposits and a ""substantial amount of their assets and certain liabilities."" ""Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,"" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. ""This acquisition modestly benefits our company overall, it is accretive to shareholders, it helps further advance our wealth strategy, and it is complementary to our existing franchise."" First Republic's 84 branches opened as JPMorgan Chase Bank branches on Monday, and depositors have full access to their money. Its takeover caps a rocky week for First Republic, and it marks the latest event in a a period of banking turmoil that has roiled the country's financial system. First Republic has struggled ever since the U.S. took over Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, but its death spiral began in earnest last Monday, when it announced that it had lost about $100 billion worth of deposits during the first three months of the year. Its stock tumbled so much last week that the New York Stock Exchange halted trading several dozen times. On Friday, shares closed at $3.51 — down more than 97% year to date. President Biden on Monday welcomed the takeover and sale of First Republic, saying it would ""make sure that the banking system is safe and sound,"" while he emphasized taxpayers would not be on the hook for the rescue. A death spiral First Republic is the largest U.S. lender to fail since Washington Mutual in 2008, which was also acquired by JPMorgan Chase. In March, federal regulators swept in to protect customers of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank after both lenders suffered a run on the bank, with depositors clamoring to take out their money. Citing potential risk to the broader financial system, regulators took unprecedented action to insure all deposits at the two banks — even deposits that exceeded the FDIC's $250,000 threshold for insurance. The failure of those two lenders sparked a search for other lenders that would be vulnerable to deposit outflows, and First Republic was soon identified. The San Francisco-based bank, which was founded in 1985, mostly catered to wealthy clients, offering home mortgages and commercial loans. First Republic was tossed a lifeline in March after 11 of the country's biggest banks, led by JPMorgan, deposited $30 billion in it in a bid to raise confidence. Those moves ultimately failed to convince Wall Street, and customers continued to withdraw their money. First Republic had few options left First Republic then attempted to sell itself but found few takers, eventually leaving a government-led rescue as the only available option. The FDIC asked several banks to consider placing bids, and JPMorgan, the largest lender in the country, emerged as the winner. JPMorgan's Dimon noted the bank made its bid for First Republic in a way that would ""minimize costs"" to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC estimates the takeover and sale of First Republic will cost that fund about $13 billion. For JPMorgan, the acquisition includes the ""assumption of approximately $92 billion of deposits"" held by First Republic and the acquisition of about $173 billion of its loans and around $30 billion of its securities."" Banking fears have subsided But unlike Silicon Valley Bank and Signature, whose failures had threatened to spark more bank runs, the situation is calmer now. Earnings reports from smaller lenders this month showed deposit outflows have largely stabilized. ""That fear, that mass exodus that people were concerned about just didn't happen,"" says Jared Shaw, a bank analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, who notes lenders were proactive. ""One of the things that the banks did a great job with was reaching out to their customers, explaining their balance sheets, and explaining where their liquidity comes from."" And federal regulators were keen to stress First Republic's woes were not a sign of wider problems in the banking industry. ""Americans should feel confident in the safety of their deposits and the ability of the banking system to fulfill its essential function of providing credit to businesses and families,"" according to a U.S. Treasury spokesperson. That's something Dimon echoed in comments he made to reporters after the deal was announced. ""The system is very, very sound,"" he said. Bank regulations in focus now The FDIC actions come as regulators themselves have been under scrutiny about whether they could have done more to prevent the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. On Friday, the Federal Reserve took part of the blame for Silicon Valley Bank's failure saying it should have had more aggressive supervision of the lender. The Fed also recommended adopting a tougher approach to bank regulation, including subjecting more smaller lenders to increased oversight by the Fed. Meanwhile, the FDIC issued a report Monday outlining possible changes to the country's deposit system. The FDIC report said that offering unlimited deposit insurance would likely be too costly and could encourage risky behavior by banks. But it found a targeted increase in the insurance limit for certain business accounts might offer advantages — especially if paired with other moves such as limits on rapid bank withdrawals. Any change in the deposit insurance system would require congressional authorization.",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/04/28/gettyimages-1485497904_wide-7df03be22efa6d3668b21a7f6026dbfb3b2fe605-s1400-c100.jpg,2023-05-01,-0.316,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Washington Mutual', 'description': 'former American bank holding company', 'full_name': 'Washington Mutual', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Washington_Mutual_Tower%2C_Seattle%2C_August_2006.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York Stock Exchange', 'latitude': 40.70677185058594, 'longitude': -74.0112533569336, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wall Street', 'latitude': 37.61832046508789, 'longitude': -112.16436004638672, 'location_type': 'UNDETERMINED'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dimon', 'latitude': 64.12834167480469, 'longitude': -19.906320571899414, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S. Treasury', 'latitude': 33.32728958129883, 'longitude': -107.71475982666016, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"First Republic Bank, the largest U.S. lender to fail since 2008, was taken over by regulators and sold to JPMorgan Chase.

First Republic has struggled since the March collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and investors and depositors had grown increasingly worried it might not survive because of a high amount of uninsured deposits and exposure to low interest rate loans. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said early Monday that First Republic Bank’s 84 branches in eight states will reopen as branches of JPMorgan Chase Bank and depositors will have full access to all of their deposits. Regulators worked through late last week and this weekend to find a way forward before U.S. stock markets opened. They solicited bids for First Republic Bank’s assets and once again turned to JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s biggest bank, with a reputation as a dealmaker during times of crisis. Treasury officials also enlisted JPMorgan last month to spearhead a $30 billion funding package for First Republic. “Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,” said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. As of April 13, First Republic had approximately $229 billion in total assets and $104 billion in total deposits, the FDIC said. The FDIC estimated its deposit insurance fund would take a $13 billion hit from taking First Republic into receivership. Its rescue of Silicon Valley Bank cost the fund a record $20 billion. Before Silicon Valley Bank failed, First Republic had a banking franchise that was the envy of most of the industry. Its clients — mostly the rich and powerful — rarely defaulted on their loans. The bank has made much of its money making low-cost loans to the wealthy, which reportedly included Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Flush with deposits from the well-heeled, First Republic saw total assets more than double from $102 billion at the end of 2019’s first quarter, when its full-time workforce was 4,600. But the vast majority of its deposits, like those in Silicon Valley and Signature Bank, were uninsured — that is, above the $250,000 limit set by the FDIC. And that worried analysts and investors. If First Republic were to fail, its depositors might not get all their money back. Those fears were crystalized in the bank’s recent quarterly results. First Republic said customers rushed to pull out more than $100 billion in deposits following the failure of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank. Unlike bank runs throughout history, First Republic’s demise was fueled by the speed of social media and digital withdrawals that can be made in seconds from a cell phone. San Francisco-based First Republic said the $30 billion in funding it received in mid-March from a group of large banks helped it stanch the bleeding. To turn itself around, the bank planned to sell off unprofitable assets, including the low interest mortgages that it provided to wealthy clients. It also announced plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, which totaled about 7,200 employees in late 2022. Investors were skeptical, and the devastating quarterly report sent them running for the exits. First Republic shares fell 75% last week and closed Friday at $3.51. Any remaining shareholders are likely to get wiped out. The shares traded at $115 on March 8, right before Silicon Valley Bank failed. The Federal Reserve and FDIC, which regulate the banking industry along with the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, could face renewed criticism over their handling of First Republic. Both acknowledged Friday in separate reports that lax supervision had contributed to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For Dimon and JPMorgan, there may be a sense of déjà vu: Back in 2008, Dimon was the go-to banker for Washington to find private solutions for that banking crisis and JPMorgan acquired both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. In a statement, JPMorgan portrayed the First Republic deal as beneficial both to the financial system and the company. As part of the agreement, the FDIC will share losses with JPMorgan on First Republic’s loans. JPMorgan expects the addition of First Republic to add $500 million to its net income per year, although it expects to incur $2 billion in costs integrating First Republic into its operations over the next 18 months.

The FDIC had seized control of the bank over the weekend and auctioned it off. JPMorgan won that auction, and it’s paying a cool $10.6 billion for the bank, but not without some guarantees. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the deal to rescue First Republic only modestly benefits his bank. “They are booking a $2.6 billion gain up front,” said David Chiaverini, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. “And then they are going to be generating 500 million incremental earnings annually going forward.” The bank also gets a bunch of new affluent customers, said Tiffani Montez, a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. “It’s a quick way for JPMorgan Chase to increase their market share,” she said. On the downside, restructuring will cost JPMorgan Chase about $2 billion, and the bank said it’ll also have to repay $25 billion to other banks that tried to keep First Republic afloat. So for all that, the bank got a deal sweetener. The FDIC agreed to shoulder the bulk of any losses from certain mortgages and commercial loans that would come with First Republic. “I think it was extremely important to do that,” said David George, senior bank analyst with Baird. He said many of the loans JPMorgan Chase would acquire do not offer attractive returns, and instead would be “Well below market rate.” Having the FDIC share the burden of losses makes the below market returns more palatable. Patricia McCoy, a professor of law at Boston College Law School, said there may be bigger concerns with the loans themselves. Take commercial loans, for example. “There’s a lot of talk on the street that commercial loans to finance office space in the future may go into default because there are so many office vacancies,” she said. McCoy also said a lot of the residential mortgages JPMorgan Chase would take on are interest-only mortgages, where payments suddenly jump after a few years. “Interest-only mortgages have a much higher default rate than ordinary fixed-rate mortgages,” she said. If those concerns pan out, having the FDIC shoulder some of that risk would offer substantial protection.",https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1486875390-e1682974612731.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&w=1200,2023-05-01,-0.163,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 37.12166976928711, 'longitude': -93.47138977050781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Baird', 'latitude': 32.394020080566406, 'longitude': -99.39424133300781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Boston College', 'latitude': 52.97330093383789, 'longitude': -0.015200000256299973, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'McCoy', 'latitude': 37.61867141723633, 'longitude': -86.38163757324219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion, gaining affluent customers and increased market share.

First Republic Bank fails: Was it a bailout? - ABC News,First Republic Bank fails: Was it a bailout?  ABC News,"Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3MvcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1mYWlscy1iYWlsb3V0L3N0b3J5P2lkPTk4OTgzNDEz0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvQnVzaW5lc3MvcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1mYWlscy1iYWlsb3V0L3N0b3J5P2lkPTk4OTgzNDEz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,ABC News,"The collapse of First Republic Bank on Monday left it under control of the U.S. government, which quickly sold the bank to JPMorgan Chase. The move aimed to shore up the financial system after a cascade of major bank failures. JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank, retained the majority of First Republic's assets and all of its deposits, JPMorgan Chase said on Monday. In turn, the deal fully protects depositors at First Republic, who immediately became customers of JPMorgan Chase. To achieve the rescue, however, a federal agency provided $50 billion in financing to JPMorgan Chase, setting off questions about whether the government had orchestrated a bank bailout. Speaking at the White House on Monday, President Joe Biden applauded the government effort and assured that the move would not require taxpayer support. ""Regulators have taken action to facilitate the sale of First Republic Bank and ensure that all depositors are protected and the taxpayers are not on the hook,"" Biden said. ""These actions are going to make sure that the banking system is safe and sound,"" he added. Here's what to know about the rescue of First Republic and whether it's a bailout: Is the First Republic rescue a bailout? First Republic, the nation's 14th-largest bank, fell into financial turmoil because it specialized in long-term mortgage loans to affluent clients. As interest rates rose rapidly over the past year, the mortgage loans and other investments lost value, leaving the bank with losses on a sizable portion of its balance sheet. After the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month, panicked depositors withdrew a significant share of the bank's funds in part because many of the customers held deposits that exceeded the limit covered by federal insurance. If the bank had failed without a buyer, the remaining uninsured depositors may have lost their funds. JPMorgan Chase on Monday agreed to acquire all of the bank's $103.9 billion in deposits as well as the majority of its $229.1 billion in assets, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a federal agency. As part of the deal, the FDIC provided $50 billion in financing to JPMorgan Chase, the bank said on Monday. Ultimately, the final cost to the FDIC will be approximately $13 billion, the agency said. The financing from the FDIC qualifies as a bailout since it marks the transfer of funds from the U.S. government to JPMorgan Chase as a condition of the sale of First Republic, some experts told ABC News. ""The biggest fear is banking runs and lost confidence -- that is why the FDIC had to act quickly,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at broker OANDA. ""I would consider that a bailout."" ""The focus is to make sure the bank failure doesn't significantly lead to a crisis,"" he added. Anat Admati, a professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, echoed the sentiment, noting that the FDIC appears to have helped ease the acquisition of First Republic. ""This seems to be more that guaranteeing deposits, and then it becomes something that I would consider a bailout,"" Admati told ABC News. In backstopping First Republic customers, however, the FDIC ultimately carried out its mandate of guaranteeing depositors, even if by indirect means, Morris Pearl, a former managing director at asset manager BlackRock, told ABC News. ""It depends on your definition of the word 'bailout,'"" Pearl said. ""It’s kind of like if you damage your car, the insurance company might pay to repair the car or they might say this car is beyond hope and we’ll give you money to buy a new car."" JPMorgan Chase said the government chose it as a buyer because the bank's bid gave the FDIC more favorable terms than rival offers. ""Our financial strength, capabilities and business model allowed us to develop a bid to execute the transaction in a way to minimize costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund,"" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. Will the sale of First Republic cost U.S. taxpayers? The government funds required for the sale of First Republic will come out of the Deposit Insurance Fund, a pool of billions of dollars kept in case the government needs to cover insured depositors after a bank failure, the FDIC said. The Deposit Insurance Fund receives funding from banks, which pay insurance premiums in order to receive protection from the U.S. government and offer that guarantee for customers. The agency also derives income from investments made with the insurance revenue. In turn, the bailout of First Republic will not draw on individual taxpayers, since the funds do not come from taxes levied on everyday Americans. If the banking panic continues to spread, the federal government may have to take further action that draws on the Deposit Insurance Fund, potentially exhausting the fund and calling on taxpayers to supplement it with additional money. For now, however, such an outcome appears remote. At the end of last year, the Deposit Insurance Fund held $128.2 billion, according to a quarterly report.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/50f14df0-dc02-4f0b-b21a-7da03c5373bc/First-Republic-Bank-ap-ml-230501_1682953420664_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600,2023-05-01,-0.274,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'White House', 'latitude': -18.355670928955078, 'longitude': 30.927059173583984, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Biden', 'latitude': 5.229050159454346, 'longitude': -1.0081199407577515, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ABC', 'latitude': 45.45650100708008, 'longitude': 9.185050010681152, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Stanford', 'latitude': 37.53118896484375, 'longitude': -84.6618881225586, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'BlackRock', 'latitude': 39.721771240234375, 'longitude': -76.86109161376953, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pearl', 'latitude': 32.27458953857422, 'longitude': -90.13202667236328, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"First Republic Bank collapsed and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase with $50 billion in financing from the FDIC.

First Republic Wealth Advisors Voted With Their Feet–And It Wasn't For JPMorgan - Forbes,First Republic Wealth Advisors Voted With Their Feet–And It Wasn't For JPMorgan  Forbes,"Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3NlcmdlaWtsZWJuaWtvdi8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L2ZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLXdlYWx0aC1hZHZpc29ycy12b3RlZC13aXRoLXRoZWlyLWZlZXRhbmQtaXQtd2FzbnQtZm9yLWpwbW9yZ2FuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Forbes,"But the failure of the California bank was a home run for Morgan Stanley. Depositors and shareholders weren’t the only ones fleeing San Francisco-based First Republic Bank before it was seized by regulators and sold to JPMorgan. As a crisis of confidence enveloped regional and specialized U.S. banks, especially those with significant levels of uninsured deposits, First Republic’s wealth-management advisors also headed for the exits. More than 40% of the struggling bank’s advisors left between the end of February and May 15, data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority show. One place those departees didn’t go en masse: JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank, which on May 1 bought most of First Republic’s assets, including the wealth management operation, for $10.6 billion in a transaction arranged by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Analysts and J.P. Morgan have touted First Republic’s $290 billion in wealth management assets as a selling point for the deal. But the advisor exodus suggests the big bank may retain fewer of those assets than widely believed, since wealthy investors tend to follow advisors when they jump ship. Using Finra’s BrokerCheck service, Forbes counted up the advisors who left First Republic and registered with another firm between the end of February and May 15th. We first searched for advisors who are now, or were previously, registered with or employed by First Republic. We then manually reviewed hundreds of individual profiles and respective registration records to see when advisors had switched firms. Of the 152 we identified as leaving during the time period we targeted, 28 went to Rockefeller Capital Management (an offshoot of the wealthy family’s own investment management office) and 19 went to Royal Bank of Canada’s wealth management arm. But the big winner was Morgan Stanley, which picked up 49. Only 11 First Republic advisors had moved to JPMorgan before the deal, according to Finra filings. The bulk of the 152 departures happened before May 1, but about 40 First Republic advisors registered with new firms in the following two weeks. Since there is a lag in postings to BrokerCheck, it’s likely most of those 40 departures were in the works before the May 1 announcement of the J.P. Morgan deal. It remains to be seen how many of the First Republic advisors who haven’t left already (220, according to J.P. Morgan’s most recent estimate on May 3) will stay at the bank for the long run. JPMorgan surely realized that such an exodus was taking place and would have adjusted its bid accordingly. Still, after the acquisition, JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum said one of its benefits was “accelerating some of our key growth opportunities, particularly in wealth management.” Similarly, the purchase was considered a smart deal on Wall Street in part because First Republic’s high-net-worth client base meshed with the big bank’s ambitions to expand its own wealth-management business. Wedbush analyst David Chiaverini described First Republic as “the diamond of the season of the FDIC-assisted deals over the past two months,” because of its high-net-worth client base, the kind of operation that “is increasingly being sought after by other banks and wealth managers.” S&P Global estimated First Republic’s assets could add 11% to JPMorgan's existing wealth management operation. “Assuming JPMorgan is able to retain the bulk of FRC's [remaining] wealth advisers, we believe this should generate consistent recurring revenue,” S&P analysts wrote on May 2. In fairness, part of the reason that JPMorgan received so few of the departing brokers may be its own restraint. As First Republic’s deposits and stock price spiraled lower, JPMorgan sent out an internal memo warning executives not to actively recruit First Republic advisors. “We directed our managers to never exploit a situation of stress or uncertainty,” a JPMorgan spokesperson told Forbes. Citicorp and Bank of America issued similar cautions, according to Reuters. Morgan Stanley did not respond to repeated requests to say whether it had distributed similar instructions. But there are other reasons, too–including culture and compensation–that the brokers may have favored Morgan Stanley over the big banks. Morgan Stanley was created after Congress, in the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, required that commercial banking and investment banking be split. (One of Morgan Stanley’s founders was the grandson of JPMorgan’s founder.) While the separation of investment and commercial banking was repealed more than two decades ago, the biggest commercial banks still struggle to attract some of the richer wealth management clients. “The fact that many of these wealth advisors were with First Republic and not one of the other large banks in the first place suggests that there could be some adverse selection from JPMorgan’s perspective,” notes Eric Compton, a senior analyst at Morningstar. “Meaning, these are advisors that might be more likely to leave over time to go back to the non-mega bank set up and/or culture.” What the advisors do is critical, because an advisor that moves from one firm to another typically takes roughly 75% of their client assets with them, according to research firm Cerulli Associates. But Compton figures JPMorgan structured the deal to be profitable even without the advisors who had already departed. Just acquiring First Republic’s commercial banking business, which accounted for 82% of the bank’s more than $1.6 billion in net income last year, according to filings, would leave JPMorgan with good returns, he says. (At an investor presentation Monday, JPMorgan predicted the acquisition would raise its net interest income for 2023 by $3 billion to $84 billion.) “Any ability to keep any of the additional value of First Republic (wealth clients, wealth advisors, private bankers, etc.) would be extra optionality on top of that, which is the smart way to do it,” Compton wrote in an email exchange with Forbes, adding, “by structuring it the way they did, JPMorgan minimized those risks financially, and made sure the deal made sense under multiple scenarios.” “There will definitely be some distractions throughout the integration process and it’s pretty hard to know if most clients and advisers stick around,” an Evercore ISI analysts group led by Glenn Schorr wrote after the deal, though they added that it certainly “accelerates” JPMorgan’s U.S. wealth strategy. S everal advisors interviewed by Forbes who asked to remain anonymous predicted there will be a cultural adjustment for many of the former First Republic advisors who stay at JPMorgan. Some will certainly enjoy the stability provided by being at a bigger institution, but many others could have a hard time adjusting to the more rigid structure. One example: First Republic was able to offer loans to clients on attractive terms JPMorgan is unlikely to replicate. Another key consideration is compensation structure and what kind of payouts First Republic advisors will get. As an aggressive recruiter of wealth advisors over the last few years, First Republic offered a variety of significant bonuses to attract talent. Now, those advisors will have to adjust to a new reality at JPMorgan, which like many of the other big wirehouses, promotes a team compensation model, rather than outsized awards for the stars, insiders say. Still, the bank has made aggressive efforts to persuade First Republic advisors to stay, with CEO Jamie Dimon and other executives pitching on conference calls the company’s resources and offerings for clients. JPMorgan will almost certainly be targeting certain advisors (especially those with big client assets on their books) in its retention efforts. First Republic’s strong roster of wealthy clients in coastal cities such as San Francisco and New York is, after all, the heart of this prize. “There are many tools at JPMorgan’s disposal to manage retention risk, such as compensation and incentive structures, or things like additional autonomy within JPMorgan’s overall management structure,” notes Compton. Why did Morgan Stanley receive so many of the departing wealth managers? A spokesperson for the firm insisted they didn’t solicit any of the hires. But a source familiar with the company’s operations says that Morgan Stanley did actively recruit at least some of the advisors who signed up with it. Even if the firm’s recruitment was low key, departing advisers showed a clear preference for going to Morgan Stanley and less interest in JPMorgan. “The good news is that these advisors are going from one strong brand to another strong brand,” says Rob Sechan, CEO of NewEdge Wealth, an investment advisory firm with more than $30 billion in assets under management. He predicts most advisors and their clients will welcome the stability of a bank that is not reliant on uninsured deposits to support its assets. What’s more, he points out, many of the advisors who were on long-term contracts at First Republic are more likely to stay put now in order to get their full payouts. “Clients will certainly like JPMorgan’s stability better than First Republic, but a lot might consider other options in finding their own preferred new advisor,” says James Stack, president of Investech Research and Stack Financial Management. “If clients start leaving JPMorgan, the advisors will leave.” And vice versa, of course.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a San Francisco-based elderly couple, George Miller and Janet McKinley. For more than 25 years, the couple has donated money to UC Berkeley for the Miller Scholars Program, according to the complaint filed in the suit. First Republic Bank collapsed in May due to its having too many uninsured deposits and its failure to keep up with federal interest rates, according to the complaint. The Miller Scholars Program provides selected transfer students from low-income and first-generation college student backgrounds with up to $10,000 in scholarship money over two years. In addition to financial assistance, the program provides students with mentorship, academic research and community service opportunities. If not recovered, the loss of the $7 million will result in 700 students being unable to receive the scholarship, according to Gia Jung, one of the couple’s lawyers. The lawsuit alleged that First Republic going bankrupt and the individual actions of the couple’s financial advisor Samuel Schoner are at fault. According to the complaint, between 2017 and 2021 Schoner allegedly invested over $7 million of the couple’s money in First Republic preferred shares, most of which was designated for the Miller Scholars Program. When the bank collapsed in May, the couple’s stake in the preferred stock became worth almost zero. Leading up to the bank’s fall, the couple “repeatedly” asked Schoner to sell their First Republic stock, which he did not do, the complaint alleged. Schoner had served as the financial advisor to the couple since 2012, according to the complaint. In this role, he managed their entire investment portfolio. The lawsuit alleges that Schoner intentionally misled his elderly clients by making investments that were not in their best interest and shielding the risky nature of said investments. The couple is suing First Republic and Schoner for a breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, elder abuse and fraud. “They wanted this to be part of the legacy of giving and support for UC Berkeley and its students,” Jung said. “With the funds that Mr. Miller left, this program could have operated for another 70, 80, 90, 100 years, but unfortunately it will last as long as the remaining funds allow unless we can recover what was lost.” The couple’s lawyers requested that a jury trial be set faster than a normal case due to the 87-year-old Miller’s old age, according to Tyson Redenbarger, an attorney on the case, which will be heard in San Francisco County Superior Court. Schoner and JPMorgan Chase — which acquired a substantial majority of First Republic after its collapse — declined to comment on the lawsuit.

The purchase strengthened JPMorgan’s net interest income (NII), which measures the difference between what banks earn on loans and pay out on deposits. JPMORGAN CHASE CEO JAMIE DIMON SPEAKS UP ABOUT REMOTE WORK: &apos;THERE ARE REAL FLAWS&apos; The bank sees NII of about $87 billion for the full year, higher than the $83.37 billion expected by Wall Street, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Meanwhile, JPMorgan said that net income attributable to First Republic reached $2.4 billion in the quarter and included an estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, and a provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion to establish a reserve for the acquired First Republic lending portfolio. FIRST REPUBLIC BANK SALE WILL ENSURE THAT ‘BANKING SYSTEM IS SAFE AND SOUND,’ BIDEN SAYS ""Even after the First Republic transaction, we maintained an extraordinarily strong capital ratio of 13.8% and had $1.4 trillion in cash and marketable securities,"" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.

Small and midsize banks may opt for mergers amid industry pressures - Marketplace,Small and midsize banks may opt for mergers amid industry pressures  Marketplace,"Thu, 14 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHBsYWNlLm9yZy8yMDI0LzAzLzE0L2FjcXVpcmUtb3ItYmUtYWNxdWlyZWQtbWF5LWJlLXRoZS1uZXctcmVhbGl0eS1mb3Itc21hbGwtYW5kLW1pZHNpemUtYmFua3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Marketplace,"A year after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank, some corners of the banking system are still under pressure. Banks have to pay depositors a lot more interest than they used to, and some have troubled commercial real estate loans on their balance sheets. That means many small and midsize banks are scrambling to figure out how to survive and compete in this economy. For some, that might mean they’ll have to get bigger. There are more than 4,600 banks in this country, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. “That is substantially more financial institutions than in any other country in the world,” said David Schiff, head of retail and consumer banking at the consulting company West Monroe. Schiff said over the last year, all of those institutions have witnessed the impact of shaky commercial real estate loans and rising interest rates on deposits — they’ve made the business of banking riskier and more expensive. That “really forced a lot of banks to look at themselves, particularly smaller banks, and say, ‘Is it worth the cost of admission to continue to operate independently, or should we be looking at alternatives?’” Schiff said. The thinking is, maybe the U.S. doesn’t need 4,600 banks. Maybe they should consolidate by acquiring other banks or being acquired. “There is definitely a strong industrial logic in favor of bank mergers,” said Meg Tahyar, head of the financial institutions group at the law firm Davis Polk. She advises banks on mergers and other operations, including JPMorgan Chase when it acquired First Republic last year. Tahyar said that in general, bulking up can help smaller banks stay afloat. It makes it easier to compete against bigger ones for loan business and to improve the technology and services they offer customers. “The demands for consumers to have digital services have increased, especially since the pandemic,” Tahyar said. But even though a lot of smaller and midsize banks want to consolidate, we haven’t seen many deals in the last year. Tahyar said that’s in large part because bankers aren’t sure what regulators will do. “It is very hard, and takes a very long time, to get an approval for any kind of merger,” Tahyar said. “And there’s a very high degree of uncertainty.” Earlier this year, a senior federal bank regulator said the government is trying to make the approval process more transparent. But Jeremy Kress, assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, said even if more mergers happen this year, we shouldn’t necessarily expect the banking system to be more stable. “When a bank is having trouble, making that bank bigger is often a risky strategy,” Kress said. “What they may be doing is just kicking that financial stability problem down the road.” Kress said he’s also concerned about what will happen to borrowers — especially small businesses — if there’s a wave of bank consolidation. “Having those local relationships with locally based bankers is absolutely critical for entrepreneurs,” Kress said. “And that’s what I’d worry that we’d lose when small banks consolidate.” In other words, Kress said 4,600 banks might not be too many when you think about how many communities they serve.",https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1486875274-e1710438795609.jpg?fit=2880%2C1622&w=1200,2024-03-14,-0.05,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'David Schiff', 'description': 'composer', 'full_name': 'David Schiff'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'West Monroe', 'latitude': 41.9139289855957, 'longitude': -83.43160247802734, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Schiff', 'latitude': 51.00299072265625, 'longitude': 7.1739702224731445, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'University of Michigan', 'latitude': 42.27587127685547, 'longitude': -83.73605346679688, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ross School of Business', 'latitude': 42.272499084472656, 'longitude': -83.73750305175781, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Kress', 'latitude': 34.3650016784668, 'longitude': -101.74806213378906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

Alexander Kadish and Nicholas Davey, who had generated $9.2 million in annual revenue at Morgan Stanley, alleged that bank executives, including private wealth head Robert Thornton, “omitted important facts regarding the Bank’s stability and financial health” when recruiting them in late 2022 and early last year. First Republic bank executives also misrepresented the strength of its balance sheet and liquidity in regulatory filings and public statements, the brokers said. The complaint notes that executives also declined the brokers’ request to postpone their March 3 start date by two weeks, which would have allowed them to see the signs of trouble. “To date, Mr. Kadish’s and Mr. Davey’s loss of customers as a result of the Bank’s misrepresentations and omissions, as well as the damage to their reputations, has resulted in millions of dollars per year of lost income,” the complaint states. While the case could have implications for other brokers who joined First Republic shortly before its failure, Kadish and Davey will likely face an uphill battle to show that wealth executives recruiting them were aware of the parent bank’s issues, according to Brian Neville, a lawyer with Lax & Neville in New York. “There were some similar cases for the last people recruited into firms that failed or were about to be sold but I do not know of any that were successful,” said Neville, who is not involved in the case but represented several brokers in their move to First Republic. Kadish and Davey moved to Wells Fargo Advisors in May 2023, days after JPMorgan Chase acquired the failed bank’s assets in a government-arranged deal. Neither could immediately be reached for comment. A spokesperson for J.P. Morgan declined to comment. The brokers sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as receiver for First Republic Bank, and said that specific individuals will be named as defendants later. The complaint alleges First Republic executives “recklessly” touted the firm’s stability, its “robust lending platform,” referral network and attractive payout for cash balances despite knowing that these representations were false, according to the complaint. After the duo arrived, bank officials reneged on a commitment to either grant or offer competitive terms to a client seeking a $95 million loan, as well as an $18 million mortgage. Still, even as the bank came under pressure, executives assured the brokers that it would not go into receivership and that they “would be foolish to leave,” according to the complaint. “While the Bank continued to string Mr. Kadish and Mr. Davey along with their misrepresentations and omissions, competitors were able to entice Mr. Kadish and Mr. Davey’s customers to move their accounts, and tarnish Mr. Kadish’s and Mr. Davey’s reputations,” their complaint states. Their lawyer, Jeffrey K. Riffer at Elkins Kalt Weintraub Reuben Gartside in Los Angeles, did not respond to a request for comment on the case or why it was filed in court rather than arbitrations, where intra-industry disputes are typically heard. A spokesperson for the FDIC declined comment.",https://www.advisorhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Court-House-772x485-1.jpg,2024-01-18,-0.301,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Morgan Stanley', 'description': 'U.S investment bank', 'full_name': 'Morgan Stanley', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Morgan-stanley-building.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'J.P.

How Citizens Financial positioned itself to scoop up private bankers from First Republic - Fortune,How Citizens Financial positioned itself to scoop up private bankers from First Republic  Fortune,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyNC8wMi8yNi9jaXRpemVucy1maW5hbmNpYWwtc2Nvb3AtdXAtcHJpdmF0ZS1iYW5rZXJzLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fortune,"Citizens, headquartered in Providence, R.I., has $222 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, and is the 14th-largest bank in the U.S. I recently had a conversation with John F. Woods, vice chair and CFO at Citizens, for the latest edition of Fortune’s Future of Finance series. “For a number of years, one of our strategic objectives has been to be able to serve high-net-worth individuals,” he told me. “We did that a while back when we acquired a company called Clarfeld. That created capabilities to provide advice to the high-net-worth customer segments. But we had been unable to scale that platform because of the need to have enough bankers to interact with this customer segment. The opportunity arose when First Republic started to get into trouble last spring.” First Republic Bank was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation on May 1, 2023, with the FDIC appointed as receiver. “We had an opportunity to bid on acquiring First Republic,” Woods explained. “We didn’t win that bid—JPMorgan did. However, as part of that process, we became very attracted to the business model at First Republic. And a lot of the private bankers who worked at First Republic didn’t want to work at a very large bank—that’s the reason they worked at that bank in the first place.” The conversation with a handful of people accelerated to about 150 people hired as private bankers to work in California, Boston, New York, and Florida, Woods said. The bank announced earlier this month the hiring of Michael Cherny as head of wealth management advisors and Tom Metzger as head of private wealth managers. Citizens has opened its first private-banking office in Boston and has plans to open additional offices in 2024, including in Palm Beach, Fla., and in Mill Valley, Calif., in the spring. Woods expects the private bank is going to generate significant returns. “We just formally launched [the private bank] in the fourth quarter of 2023, and we have over a billion dollars of deposits already,” he told me. During our conversation, Woods also talked about how the CFO role is changing: “The evolution of the CFO role over the past decade or more involves an intensifying expectation that the CFO is a partner to the CEO and to the business unit leaders on deriving strategy.” You can read the complete Future of Finance interview here. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Leaderboard Cosmin Pitigoi was named CFO at Flywire Corp. (Nasdaq: FLYW), effective March 4. Pitigoi previously spent 20 years in finance leadership roles at PayPal and eBay, where he was most recently SVP in PayPal finance. While at eBay, Pitigoi held leadership roles across investor relations, business unit FP&A and treasury, and began his career in operational and finance roles at E-Trade and Barclays. Michael Niggemann is going to step in as interim CFO at Lufthansa Group, effective May 7, in addition to his existing duties as a board member for the division of Personnel, Logistics, and Non-Hub Business. Current CFO Remco Steenbergen is one of four executives stepping down as the airline is ""reshaping and realigning its executive board,"" as stated in the announcement. The decision comes as the airline is moving away from the COVID-19 era, according to Lufthansa. Big deal While employers often rely on colleges as a principal supplier of professional talent, college is not a guarantee of labor market success, according to a new report by Burning Glass Institute and the Strada Education Foundation. Talent Disrupted: College Graduates, Underemployment, and the Way Forward finds that one of biggest risks students face is that their degree will not provide access to a college-level job. Today, only about half of bachelor’s degree graduates secure employment in a college-level job within a year of graduation, the research finds. Among the underemployed recent college graduates, the vast majority (88%), are severely ""underemployed""—working in jobs that typically require only a high school education, or less, such as jobs in office support, retail sales, food service, and blue-collar roles in construction, transportation, and manufacturing. Just 12% are moderately underemployed, for example, working in jobs that require some education or training beyond high school but less than a bachelor's degree. The findings are based on dataset of 60 million workers in the United States, including approximately 10 million who has a terminal bachelor's degree. However, participation in internships makes a difference. There is a strong correlation between internships and college-level employment after graduation, according to the report. The odds of underemployment for graduates who had at least one internship are, on average, 48.5% lower than those who had no internships. The benefits associated with completing an internship are relatively strong across degree fields. Going deeper An updated report from the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and AICPA & CIMA finds that the largest global companies are providing more detail about their sustainability reporting, and also are obtaining a greater scope of assurance on those disclosures. The study, which is an annual benchmark now including 2022 data, also found the use of varying sustainability standards and frameworks continues to make it difficult for investors, lenders, and other stakeholders to find consistent and comparable sustainability information.

For the third quarter, Republic First reported a loss totaling $29.8 million and mark-to-market losses in its $2.6 billion securities portfolio that would far exceed its Common Equity Tier 1 capital. An investor group's decision to drop preconditions and provide Republic First Bancorp with a much-needed capital infusion may have staved off a move by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to close the Philadelphia company's bank subsidiary, Republic Bank. The investor group, led by New Jersey insurance executive George Norcross, agreed to invest $35 million Friday. Just days earlier, according to a Bloomberg report, the FDIC had sought buyers for Republic Bank. Norcross' group, which includes his brother Philip Norcross, a prominent New Jersey attorney, and Greg Braca, TD Bank's former CEO, is no stranger to the $6.3 billion-asset Republic First. They've been vying for control of the company since the start of 2022. In recent weeks, however, the group has shifted from battling management to seeking to prop it up. The group signed a letter of intent to participate in a planned $75 million capital raise in September. That agreement stated explicitly that the group's cash would come after Republic First secured $40 million from outside investors. According to the Sept. 26 letter of intent, ""the consummation of the investments by the [group] and the additional investors will occur simultaneously."" On Friday, in a press release, Republic First and the investor group stated that the remainder of the capital raise — which will seek as much as $65 million from outside investors — will commence ""upon closing of the new investment."" Additionally, Braca and Philip Norcross would join Republic First's board of directors, with Norcross serving as chairman. Four so-called ""legacy"" directors, all of whom served during the tenure of former CEO Vernon Hill, will step down. The Sept. 26 agreement permitted two legacy directors to retain seats. Neither Republic First nor the Norcross-led investor group would comment on the changes to the agreement. Pennsylvania's Department of Banking and Securities, Republic First's state regulator, declined comment. The FDIC does not comment ""on open and operating institutions,"" a spokeswoman wrote in an email. While a $35 million capital infusion would benefit Republic First, it would fall far short of solving the company's capital woes, said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Virginia-based banking consultant. Based on its Sept. 30 call report, Republic First has more than $500 million in mark-to-market losses embedded in its $2.6 billion securities portfolio — far in excess of the $301 million in Common Equity Tier 1 capital it reported. On a mark-to-market basis the bank would still be deeply insolvent, Ely said. Republic First reported $4.7 billion of deposits, but approximately $2.5 billion — or 54% — were uninsured. For the three months ending Sept. 30, Republic First reported a loss of $29.8 million. ""The numbers just jump out at you,"" Ely said. ""They're terrible numbers. ... The bottom-line question is why would anyone invest in First Republic or even buy it without FDIC assistance."" The Norcross-led group declined to comment on the call report data, as did a spokesman for the bank. Community banking Republic First to partner with activist investors in new capital raise September 28, 2023 4:28 PM Republic First has spent much of the year seeking additional capital. In March, it announced plans to raise a total of $125 million in partnership with Castle Creek, but it canceled the effort ""as a result of recent strategic initiatives and other considerations,"" according to a May 15 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For his part, George Norcross said he hoped additional capital combined with new leadership on the board would lead to a change in fortune for Republic First. ""As we said when we first announced we had taken a stake in Republic First more than 18 months ago, we believe that with proper board leadership and a focus on improving operations, the company can provide great service to its customers and depositors as well as value to its shareholders,"" Norcross said in the press release Friday. ""This investment and new leadership on the board is the next step of what will be the new Republic First.""

Former First Republic Wealth Boss Exits JPMorgan With Plans for RIA–Sources - AdvisorHub,Former First Republic Wealth Boss Exits JPMorgan With Plans for RIA–Sources  AdvisorHub,"Thu, 14 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdmlzb3JodWIuY29tL2Zvcm1lci1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy13ZWFsdGgtYm9zcy1leGl0cy1qcG1vcmdhbi13aXRoLXBsYW5zLWZvci1yaWEtc291cmNlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,AdvisorHub,"Robert L. Thornton, the former head of First Republic Bank’s private wealth division who oversaw its dramatic growth over the past decade, is planning to launch his own firm, according to two sources familiar with his plan. Thornton, who had been with First Republic since 2004, departed JPMorgan Chase & Co., on Wednesday, almost seven months after its purchase of the failed San Francisco bank, according to the sources and registration records. Thornton’s role at JPMorgan had been unclear since it purchased First Republic’s assets out of government receivership in May and folded it into its traditional brokerage unit, J.P. Morgan Advisors, led by CEO Phil Sieg, the sources said. The timing of the exit likely coincides with the expiration of a retention agreement Thornton signed shortly after the deal, they added. It is unclear how far along Thornton, who is based in San Francisco, is with his plans for a new firm. He is expected to recruit former First Republic brokers and had garnered loyalty from many, including those who had been there for more than 10 years, two of the sources said. Thornton did not return requests for comment sent through email and social media. He spent the first 20 years of his career in investment banking and first registered as a broker in 1987 with Goldman Sachs, joined Credit Suisse five years later and then moved to Deutsche Bank in 2001. Thornton was tasked in 2010 with building out First Republic’s wealth division and grew the business over the next decade by sourcing well-heeled customers from its bank and spending big to hire big teams from its larger Wall Street rivals. First Republic’s broker roster grew to around 100 teams by 2021, up from 30 to 40 teams when Thornton took over, the executive said in a 2021 podcast. Following an exodus of dozens of advisors, the unit had around 230 brokers when JPMorgan took it over in May, although some have continued to trickle out over the past seven months. A spokesperson for JPMorgan could not immediately comment on or confirm Thornton’s departure. The firm is still in the process of officially moving former First Republic brokers and customer accounts onto the JPMorgan platform. In starting his own firm, Thornton would be throwing his hat in the ring with other former First Republic alums who have been building advisory firms. Another former wealth leader and direct report to Thornton, David S. Breslin, earlier this year opened a retail wealth business for venture capital firm General Catalyst and seeded it with a large ex-First Republic team. Other defectors this year have joined former First Republic colleagues at IEQ Capital, a private equity-backed RIA in Foster City, California that launched in 2019. Two other former First Republic luminaries who left in 2019 run another RIA, Evoke Wealth, in Los Angeles. Many of the larger teams who joined First Republic in recent years from wirehouses are still bound by the big-money deals that they took to join the bank. Those teams are required to pay back those bonuses, some of which exceeded 400% of their top producer’s annual revenue, to leave, which means they must negotiate with a hiring firm to cover the balance. Thornton will also have to find a way to convince First Republic brokers he can still provide all the resources that he had been able to deliver when attached to a larger bank, a challenge he acknowledged in the 2021 podcast. “While teams enjoy autonomy and being entrepreneurial, going independent is very challenging in certain respects because you don’t get the breadth of other wealth management services,” Thornton said on the podcast with industry recruiter Mindy Diamond. “You don’t get the brand benefit. You don’t get the banking, which is part of our secret sauce.” Clients “are not always entirely comfortable with a team on their own” in terms of “compliance, oversight and safety of assets,” Thornton added.",https://www.advisorhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Robert-Thornton-772x485-1.jpg,2023-12-14,-0.167,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase & Co.', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Thornton', 'latitude': 38.22602844238281, 'longitude': -121.42466735839844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361068725586, 'longitude': -97.82250213623047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Credit Suisse', 'latitude': 47.369598388671875, 'longitude': 8.539449691772461, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Deutsche Bank', 'latitude': 50.1138916015625, 'longitude': 8.668609619140625, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wall Street', 'latitude': 37.61832046508789, 'longitude': -112.16436004638672, 'location_type': 'UNDETERMINED'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'RIA', 'latitude': 6.533329963684082, 'longitude': 21.5, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Foster City', 'latitude': 37.55855178833008, 'longitude': -122.27108001708984, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Los Angeles', 'latitude': 34.05223083496094, 'longitude': -118.24368286132812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Robert L.

""We can confirm a D&O probe into First Republic is taking place,"" a spokesperson told Reuters, referring to the bank's directors and officers. The regulator did not provide further details. The investigation, which has not previously been reported, is the third the FDIC has opened into bank failures earlier this year which cost the federal government's deposit insurance fund about $32 billion. FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in March that the agency was also probing possible misconduct related to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank New York. The FDIC has not provided updates on these investigations. The three banks, which combined held more than a half trillion dollars in assets, failed following depositor runs. Regulators have said they each exhibited weak risk management and ran high levels of uninsured deposits. As with SVB and Signature Bank, the FDIC is probing whether First Republic executives and board members broke rules that require them to act in the bank's best interests. Under federal law, the FDIC can ban former directors and officers from the industry, and impose fines for breaching their fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices that involve dishonesty or ""willful or continuing disregard"" for a bank's wellbeing. Former First Republic CEO and President Michael Roffler and former executive Chairman James Herbert could not immediately be reached for comment. Attorneys representing the bank's independent board members did not immediately return a request for comment. Roffler told lawmakers in May that regulators never expressed any concern about the bank's strategy, liquidity or management and that it had been ""contaminated overnight"" by the depositor panic from SVB and Signature Bank.

First Republic Bank failed in April and was placed into the receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The FDIC then sold all of the bank's deposits and virtually all of its assets to JPMorgan Chase. Lauren Justice/Bloomberg JPMorgan Chase has closed 14 former First Republic Bank branches in California, completing its initial plans to trim the failed bank's branch network after taking over in May. The offices were closed last week, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's weekly bulletin of bank branch closings and openings. Half of the locations were in San Francisco County. The remaining ones were spread across six other counties in California. Earlier this year, JPMorgan said that it planned to close 21 First Republic branches by the end of the year. All of those closures have now been completed, according to a source familiar with the matter. The shutdowns represent one-quarter of the 84 branches that First Republic operated on April 30, when it was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and placed into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The next day, JPMorgan, which is the largest U.S. bank by asset size, acquired all of First Republic's deposits and virtually all of its $229.1 billion of assets. The deal was struck one week after First Republic disclosed that it had lost $100 billion of deposits in the weeks following the abrupt failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March. JPMorgan has said that folding in First Republic gives it access to a mostly affluent client base, and allows it to expand its wealth management business. The deal is expected to add about $500 million in earnings every year, according to JPMorgan. The 21 branches selected for closure had ""relatively low transaction volumes and are generally within a short drive from another First Republic office,"" JPMorgan said in a statement earlier this year. The 63 remaining First Republic offices will be rebranded as Chase Bank branches. But more branch closures are expected to follow. Over time, the remaining First Republic branches will either stay open because they're in better locations than nearby Chase branches, or they will be closed due to their proximity to an existing Chase office, Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of consumer and community banking, said during JPMorgan's investor day in May. Some other branches may get converted into ""private client centers,"" she said. Wealth management JPMorgan Chase gets First Republic's wealth clients. Can it keep them? May 1, 2023 4:12 PM Shortly before First Republic was taken into receivership, the San Francisco-based bank had said that it planned to cut as much as 25% of its workforce due to an extreme squeeze on profitability. Then in May, JPMorgan notified 1,000 First Republic workers that they would not be offered employment following the acquisition. First Republic was the second largest bank to fail in U.S. history, based on assets. It was one of several regional banks that drew intense scrutiny after the failures of SVB on March 10 and Signature on March 12. Both banks experienced massive deposit runs. In mid-March, JPMorgan and 10 other big banks pledged $30 billion of deposits to try to stabilize First Republic's balance sheet after the exodus of deposits. Despite the infusion, deposits continued to exit the company. By the end of April, there were few options left to save it.

Bloomberg News The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. acknowledged in a report Friday that it could have done more to proactively address risks associated with First Republic Bank's high levels of uninsured deposits, interest rate sensitivity and rapid growth — all of which ultimately contributed to the bank's failure. ""[The FDIC's Risk Management Supervision unit] could have been more forward-looking in assessing how increasing interest rates could negatively impact the bank, given its concentration of lower-rate, longer-duration loans and dependence on low-cost funding and continual growth,"" the report said. ""RMS could have done more to effectively challenge and encourage bank management to implement strategies to mitigate interest rate risk starting in the second half of 2021 … [and] pursued a more urgent supervisory response, such as potentially downgrading the Sensitivity to Market Risk component and/or issuing [supervisory recommendations] urging management to develop strategies to mitigate interest rate risk."" Friday's report comes as the FDIC and other regulators are already taking a multitude of actions to prevent future bank failures such as proposals to raise capital requirements and revamp long-term debt and resolution-planning requirements. The San Francisco based bank's demise in May — the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history — was triggered by a surge in deposit withdrawals after customers caught wind of First Republic's declining financial health, leading JPMorgan Chase to acquire the firm in a government-brokered deal. FDIC — the primary federal supervisor of First Republic — noted that while hindsight puts into stark relief the bank's underlying vulnerabilities, the agency consistently gave bank management ""strong"" supervisory ratings and rated the bank ""satisfactory"" during the four years before the failure. FDIC further found that examination staff said that bank management was responsive to supervisory feedback and recommendations, quick to remediate findings and easy to work with. What those chummy relations obscured, however, was that First Republic's business model had a multitude of vulnerabilities. The FDIC concluded that more proactive supervisory actions — such as addressing interest rate risk or liquidity risk management — might not have prevented First Republic's failure given the magnitude and speed of deposit withdrawals. However, it emphasized that meaningful actions to mitigate interest rate risk and address funding concentrations would have made the bank less vulnerable to the contagion effects during the banking crisis this spring. A major vulnerability was the firm's heavy reliance on uninsured deposits, a concentrated and volatile source of funding. As interest rates rose, FDIC said the banks' asset-liability mismatch became apparent. ""First Republic's assets were concentrated in longer-term loans that generated low interest income, while deposits required to fund those loans were short-term. Starting in the September 2022 time frame, customers began moving from non-interest-bearing accounts to time/certificate of deposit (CD) accounts, shifting the cost structure from minimal to higher cost accounts,"" the report noted. ""This shift increased First Republic's interest expense and compressed [its] net interest margin."" Banking Crisis 2023 FDIC largely blames poor management for Signature's failure April 28, 2023 1:28 PM The bank's troubles intensified when contagion effects from the March failure of Silicon Valley Bank spread on channels like social media. First Republic's disproportionately sophisticated investors — many of whom, like SVB's customers, were based in the venture capital and tech sectors — began to withdraw their deposits, triggering a run. ""Contagion effects from SVB's failure began to spread through traditional media, social media, and short sellers to other banks with perceived similar risk characteristics,"" the report noted. ""While First Republic was initially able to manage liquidity to meet withdrawal requests, management's strategic decision to retain a long-standing business model with a significant asset/liability mismatch during a period of rising interest rates contributed to a loss of confidence in the bank on the part of depositors, and, ultimately constrained options for the bank to restructure its balance sheet by selling assets or raising capital."" As contagion effects escalated, the bank had to borrow substantial amounts of liquidity from the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Federal Reserve's discount window to balance its books. Despite efforts to slow the outflows, a substantial loss of deposits in the first quarter triggered a negative market response, a significant drop in the bank's stock price, and a resumption of substantial deposit outflows. Much of First Republic's susceptibility to contagion was attributed to its rapid growth in years leading up to its demise. The FDIC noted in its report that in the four-year window leading up to the failure, First Republic doubled in size while actual examination hours declined 11%. While the FDIC maintained that the bank was adequately supervised and staffing shortages were not broadly cited as an issue, it admitted that such rapid growth should have been monitored more closely. ""While we would not expect examination hours to parallel asset growth and while there could be explanations such as examination efficiencies on the surface, this trend appears counterintuitive and may have warranted greater explanation in annual supervisory plans,"" the FDIC report said. ""While First Republic's growth was not as aggressive as SVB or Signature Bank, which experienced annual asset growth rate of 45% and 31%, respectively, First Republic grew about twice as rapidly as its peer banks."" FDIC's post-mortem review marks the second time this year it reflected on its handling of a failed bank, following a similar report issued in April on the failure of New York-based Signature. Friday's report indicated that without the failures of SVB and Signature, First Republic might have held on, given its relatively healthy supervisory bill of health. Leading up to and especially in the wake of the failures, however, the FDIC said it could have more proactively voiced concerns.

He recalls watching everything unfold at his former employer with both sadness and surprise. “When SVB went into receivership, it was a very sad day for all of us. I had spent eight years in total there. I knew a lot of people there, and just felt really, really bad,” Heshmati told TechCrunch in an interview. “Plus, SBV did a lot for the ecosystem.” But Heshmati didn’t have time to linger long on SVB’s downfall. As First Republic’s then-managing director and head of venture banking, he soon had to turn his attention to helping First Republic meet a surge in demand, a surge that began as soon as the regional banking crisis kicked off on March 10. At the time, Heshmati was at a sales conference for First Republic in San Francisco, along with executive management. “I think everybody’s phones started to get dinged almost at the same time and many of us were hearing, ‘I need new accounts at First Republic’ or ‘There’s a bit of a situation and we need a potential place to move our money,’” recounts Heshmati. “The first step in the emotional roller coaster was that we went all hands on deck.” He added: “Everybody was quickly trying to figure out how do we support this type of new account opening at scale, with this type of volume coming in…without comprising any of our compliance.” The initial reaction from some people was excitement over “so many new accounts.” But Heshmati knew better. “I remember walking through the lobby and seeing one particular person who had a smile on their face, thinking about the business opportunity that existed here. But I don’t think that person had ever spent any time at SVB or really understood the role they played in the ecosystem. And I remember looking at the person and saying, ‘This is not good.’” Indeed, it was a matter of days before First Republic itself became part of the contagion and the bank’s team went from opening new accounts to figuring out how to weather its own storm as the impact of Silicon Valley Bank’s fate began spilling over into other banks in the sector. It was an emotional roller coaster, Heshmati says. First Republic had been performing well year-over-year. Its stock was doing well. Many on the team were surprised that their bank was suddenly in trouble, too. “While SVB’s series of events happened really quickly, on the First Republic side of the house, it took a few weeks,” he said. “It was pretty difficult because there were moments where you looked at it and said, ‘We’re gonna get through this,’ and then there were moments that we didn’t know.” Ultimately, First Republic too collapsed and JPMorgan ended up buying the receivership it went into. Heshmati was soon offered a role at JPMorgan. But he declined the offer. In trying to determine his next steps, he said he spoke to more than a dozen banks. Heshmati ended up taking on a role at Citizens Bank, where he is now working to build the financial institution’s new venture banking practice from scratch. For context, Providence, Rhode Island-based Citizens has $22 billion in assets under management (AUM) and $177.7 billion in deposits. Its total assets were $223.1 billion as of June 30. “I did due diligence on the different banks, ranging from strength of balance sheet, size of the bank, commitment to the [startup] sector,” he said. “But Citizens just stood out. They checked every single box.” The bank, Heshmati said, seemed the most committed to building on what First Republic had started. “I wanted somebody else to be really, really excited about it, and never to be put in a situation where I felt like they were accommodating me,” he said. “There were really, really bullish — Citizens demonstrated that excitement right out the gate.” Heshmati joined Citizens Bank as head of emerging VC and innovation banking in July, helping create a new division there, called Citizens Private Bank, that is essentially adopting First Republic’s operating model. “Our goal is pretty simple — to be the ‘go to bank’ for the innovation sector,” he said. “Part of what I’ve learned since the events of March 10 and the downfall of SVB and First Republic is that a lot of people have gone to different platforms but they look and feel a whole lot different than perhaps what SVB and FRB represented for so many years.” He added: “We’re looking to bring that level of familiarity back as part of this next chapter.” Citizens wants to take things a step further by integrating cash management solutions into the practice. “We’re living in a post-crisis environment and banking where founders and investors are going to look at cash management differently than they did before. They’re asking, ‘Where do you keep it? How do you mitigate risk?,’” Heshmati said. “And so we’ve already put together a suite of solutions that allow companies and firms to come in and address that. We don’t want to ignore the elephant in the room. We want to offer the solutions to help give them what they need to get comfortable.” Citizens’ new practice is open for business, although Heshmati acknowledges it will take some time to ramp up. Heshmati is not the only former First Republic employee to join Citizens. Much of his team joined as well. In June, when Citizens announced the acceleration of its private banking growth strategy, it also announced 150 new hires, including teams formerly with First Republic, according to Brendan Coughlin, vice chair and head of consumer banking at Citizens. “After the disruption in March 2023, it became clear the market is more fragmented than ever, and founders and VCs are having a difficult time trying to identify the right long-term home,” he told TechCrunch via email. “With Sam and his team, we want to step in and fill the gap by creating the new ‘go to’ bank for the startup and venture ecosystem.” As part of the new division, Citizens is also opening a West Coast office. “Scale matters in new footprints, and the ability to hire a large and incredibly talented team at once was very attractive and became an obvious next step,” Coughlin added. Expanding into California has “always” been part of Citizens’ strategic plan, said Coughlin. Those plans included its acquisition of JMP Securities in November 2021. But in this case, the speed in which it moved was “opportunistic.” Similarly, Citizens has had a private equity practice for some time, where it worked with much larger funds, noted Coughlin. But with the demise of both SVB and FRB, Citizens saw opportunity in serving the startup and VC community. “VC financing plays an essential role in U.S. innovation, and with the collapse of SVB and FRB, which had generally dominated the mid-tier VC space, it left a huge void,” he said. “It’s similar to the geography piece — a venture-focused practice was always something we considered pursuing as part of our strategic roadmap…it was a natural fit for us to not only establish this practice and innovate as a company, but also bank the innovation economy and support the growth of young companies.” In addition to Citizens’ existing San Francisco office space for JMP, the bank is planning to “selectively” add points of physical presence with offices for its new private bankers, as well as customer-facing locations to connect the private equity and venture banking relationship with loan programs and wealth management for the GP/LP partner community.

"Nightingale CEO Put $12M Of CrowdStreet Investor Cash Into First Republic Stocks, Options Weeks Before It Failed - Bisnow","Nightingale CEO Put $12M Of CrowdStreet Investor Cash Into First Republic Stocks, Options Weeks Before It Failed  Bisnow","Fri, 15 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaXNub3cuY29tL25hdGlvbmFsL25ld3MvY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXRzL2VsaWUtc2Nod2FydHotaW52ZXN0ZWQtMTJtLW9mLWNyb3dkc3RyZWV0LWludmVzdG9yLWNhc2gtaW50by1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1iZWZvcmUtaXQtZmFpbGVkLTEyMDY5MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Bisnow,"Nightingale Properties CEO Elie Schwartz took more than $10M of the cash he raised on CrowdStreet that he told investors would be used to buy a massive Atlanta office complex and instead bet it on the recovery of First Republic Bank before it failed. On March 23, Schwartz diverted $12M in crowdsourced investor funds that were to be used to buy the Atlanta Financial Center and instead purchased $6M in First Republic stock and another $6M in First Republic options, Eric Lee, the chief restructuring officer for the entities Schwartz created to raise the funds, told CrowdStreet investors during a webinar Friday. The trades came on the heels of the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and as analysts were circling First Republic as another at-risk bank. First Republic shares had lost more than half their value in the two weeks before Schwartz bought the stock. On May 1, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized First Republic after a run on deposits and promptly sold it to JPMorgan Chase, wiping out shareholders in the bank. “Those shares and options became almost worthless,” Lee said on the webinar. “That money is gone, unfortunately.” That Schwartz personally gambled on First Republic with investor funds was the most shocking revelation disclosed on Friday in the ongoing fiasco of the CrowdStreet missing millions, but it wasn't the only new information investors learned on the webinar, hosted by Anna Phillips, the independent manager appointed to take over the two entities Nightingale created to raise cash on the platform. On the webinar, Lee, a forensic accountant and financial fraud expert, told investors Schwartz used $5.5M of the more than $50M in misappropriated funds on personal and business expenses, including on credit card payments and watches. Schwartz took $23M of CrowdStreet investor funds to pay dozens of separate third parties, Lee told the investors. Those payments range from small amounts to a $9.4M transaction. The entities weren't identified on the call, and Lee said it was unknown how much of these funds could be clawed back, especially given the expense of litigation. “You don’t want to spend a lot of money in litigation to get these little funds,” he said. CrowdStreet did not return messages seeking comment as of press time. The saga began last year when Nightingale launched two crowdfunding campaigns on CrowdStreet, first raising $45M from retail investors to buy the 915K SF Atlanta Financial Center complex from Sumitomo Corporation of America for $182M, a price that would have represented a $78M loss. Months later, Nightingale returned to the platform to raise equity to renovate a Miami Beach office building it already owned. It raised $8.8M toward that effort. More than 600 investors participated in the campaigns at a minimum commitment of $25K each, but neither deal closed. In June, CrowdStreet told investors it couldn't account for where the funds were located — they had gone directly into LLCs controlled by Schwartz rather than being placed in escrow — and accused Nightingale of misappropriating the funds. Phillips was appointed as an independent manager to take control of the LLCs and pushed both entities into bankruptcy with the intent of recovering as much of the missing millions as possible. Nightingale has run into trouble at several of its other investments. Before the Atlanta Financial Center campaign, it bought 200 West Jackson St., a Chicago office building, for $130M, funded in part by $25M of equity from CrowdStreet investors. CrowdStreet is also seeking to have Phillips take over that property, telling investors in July that the company was ""concerned that Nightingale may have acted inappropriately in managing the 200 West Jackson property as well."" The New York-based firm has a long track record of acquiring large office buildings, having made more than $10B in investments over the years. But across the country, its portfolio is struggling. It lost control of the largest office property in Philadelphia earlier this year, lost a Brooklyn office building to foreclosure and is battling foreclosure at multiple Manhattan buildings. Nightingale's alleged fraud has rocked the real estate crowdfunding industry, prompting a handful of CrowdStreet's competitors to issue statements to their customers assuring them that their investments were safe while admitting that the decade-old industry had taken a reputational hit. “Financial services and fraud are unfortunately a natural pairing, and given that our industry is still newer and on a growth curve, anything that could hurt the reputation could hurt its growth,” EquityMultiple CEO Charles Clinton told Bisnow last month. Phillips said on the webinar that her team had reached a settlement with Nightingale on behalf of the two bankrupt entities. The advanced settlement talks were first disclosed earlier this month during a bankruptcy court status update. “We have reached a settlement in principle with Mr. Schwartz and Nightingale,” she said. “There is a substantial transaction that hopefully will occur that will also benefit the investors. This could be a very good result for our investors."" Phillips didn't reveal details of the potential settlement Friday, except that it would be the basis of a plan for both entities to exit bankruptcy. Phillips said the investors could be told about the details of the settlement as soon as Thursday. The deal would still be subject to an investor vote and court approval. Phillips also told investors that she continues to cooperate with the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as Bisnow previously reported. She added the FBI to the list of agencies she said were investigating Schwartz and Nightingale but said those conversations were independent of her pursuit of a settlement. “My job is getting your money back, not putting this guy in jail,” she told investors.

It was then that Bob Thornton, the president of the wealth management unit, was tasked with shaking things up and transforming First Republic into a major player. Related: Mindy Diamond on Independence: A Rare Glimpse into the Culture, Cachet and Success of First Republic And that he did. The momentum started with two mega acquisitions that put First Republic on the map—$6B Luminous Capital and $6.1B Constellation Wealth Advisors. Those deals led to many big recruiting wins over the years, with the unit eclipsing $270 billion in assets, according to their 2022 filings. The wealth management unit that Bob helped build had the ingredients of success: a boutique culture, a strong referral mechanism, and the perfect blend of freedom and infrastructure. However, it could not withstand the regional banking crisis of 2023: First Republic Bank’s bottom fell out along with the foundation it provided for the wealth unit, leaving behind stress and uncertainty for the unit’s elite advisors. Related: Move to JPMorgan Is Full Circle for Many First Republic Advisors Today, Bob is taking all that he learned and starting a new chapter in the RIA world—and the story unfolds with backing from one of the industry’s premier private equity firms, Summit Partners. In this episode, Bob and special guest Melanie Whelan, managing director at Summit Partners, speak candidly with Mindy Diamond. They discuss: The reality of what happened to the wealth management unit at First Republic—and what Bob learned from that experience. Bob’s vision for the new firm—and why he feels top advisors will be attracted to it. The value that Summit Partners sees in this venture—and how Bob’s expertise in creating the “secret sauce” that attracted top advisors to First Republic was an attractive proposition to the PE firm. The role that Summit Partners will play in this partnership—and the growing trend of private equity in the RIA space. Plus, Melanie talks about how her experience as both COO and CEO roles at SoulCycle is shaping the process of building and growing the new wealth management business from the ground up. It’s rare, behind-the-scenes access to the creation of a new firm—that, as of this recording, the name of which has yet to be revealed.

The 1.02 trillion Swedish kronor ($114 billion) pension fund said Dec. 5 that it will lead the class action against First Republic ""with the goal of getting back as much as possible of the capital that investors lost,"" according to a translation of a news release. Alecta's 9.7 billion kronor holding in First Republic Bank was sold at a loss in March for 7.3 billion kronor. ""We have a duty to take the legal measures we can to get back as much of the capital as possible after First Republic's collapse,"" said CEO Peder Hasslev in the translation of the release. Alecta said by taking an active role in the U.S. court it is working to maximize the capital it can recover for itself and other participants in the class action. How much it can recover is ""difficult to assess,"" adding that it normally takes years before a final ruling is made. The Stockholm-based pension fund requested lead plaintiff status. U.S. District Judge James Donato is overseeing the case, being heard in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The pension fund also is passively participating in class actions against Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. Alecta had a total 12 billion kronor invested in the two banks; that was written down to zero. The investments led to an investigation by the board and the Swedish watchdog Finansinspektionen That resulted in several job casualties among staff including CEO Magnus Billing, who left in April. Alecta is also being scrutinized over its holding in real estate firm Heimstaden Bostad and whether rules were broken in its investment. Sweden's National Prosecutor's Office launched a preliminary investigation into suspected corruption offenses related to the investment in November.

Leader Bank Hires from First Republic to Build Startup Banking Unit - Banker & Tradesman,Leader Bank Hires from First Republic to Build Startup Banking Unit  Banker & Tradesman,"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYmFua2VyYW5kdHJhZGVzbWFuLmNvbS9sZWFkZXItYmFuay1oaXJlcy1mcm9tLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLXRvLWJ1aWxkLXN0YXJ0dXAtYmFua2luZy11bml0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Banker & Tradesman,"Arlington-based Leader Bank has become the second Boston-area community bank to intentionally pursue clients in the region’s tech economy with the hiring of eight-year First Republic Bank veteran Vitaliy Schafer. “This is something we’ve been wanting to do for about five years, but we weren’t really able to find a way to properly wedge into it because [Silicon Valley Bank] and First Republic had a lock on the market,” Leader Bank President Jay Tuli said. “We’ve taken our time to bring the right person in.” At First Republic, Schafer was a Boston-based managing director serving clients in the local tech sector and the private equity, venture capital and hedge fund companies that funded it. When the successive collapses of SVB and First Republic sent startups and venture capital firms running to diversify where they kept their deposits, Leader found an opportunity to finally get in on the region’s booming tech sector. “We’ve fallen into it a little bit, more by accident. Especially when the SVB and First Republic stuff happened, a number of of clients came over, referred by our contacts,” Tuli said. “The majority were Massachusetts-based, and a lot of them were smaller VC funds, themselves.” Leader plans to build on this foundation with a familiar playbook that SVB, First Republic and their local rival Cambridge Trust have successfully used: develop banking and lending products and a knowledge base that startups and venture capital firms need, and start hosting events to connect startup executives to investors, other founders and potential employees. “What startups need is a lot of connections, and this is where the relationship [with the bank] is really important,” Tuli said. “They need connections to potential investors, perfecting their pitch. They need some hand-holding as they build their business.” While many startups don’t need debt early in their life cycle, Tuli said the relationships Leader hopes to build with startups can grow from simple depositors as those startups grow over the long term. Leader hopes its relatively small size – $4.02 billion in assets, $3.43 billion in deposits – can help it stand out when compared to the two biggest banks serving the local tech sector: SVB owner First Citizens Bank and JPMorgan Chase, which absorbed First Republic. “We think there’s an opening here for a smaller and more nimble bank to come in,” Tuli said. “SVB was already big and now they’re part of a much bigger bank. In a way they can serve the much bigger clients better and it makes it harder for them to serve the smaller clients. It’s also about the team members, the employees. They don’t all want to work for such a large organization. The appeal for them was the entrepreneurial nature, the smaller size of the banks they worked for.” At Leader, Schafer’s title will be “director of venture capital, private equity and technology banking,” and Tuli said the bank is looking to “opportunistically” hire additional staff for Schafer’s team as it finds them. The bank hopes to grow its technology banking unit to $500 million in deposits in the next five years, Tuli said. While recession worries, the spring’s bank failures and higher interest rates have caused some investors to redirect funds to less risky investments and away from startups, Tuli said that he believes the bank is at an ideal time to get into the tech space and take advantage of any growing thaw in the tech sector’s capital markets.",https://bankerandtradesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/leader-bank-file-1024x771.jpg,2023-09-06,0.071,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Arlington', 'latitude': 42.41537094116211, 'longitude': -71.15644073486328, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Boston', 'latitude': 42.358428955078125, 'longitude': -71.05976867675781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361068725586, 'longitude': -97.82250213623047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Schafer', 'latitude': 50.410301208496094, 'longitude': 8.035409927368164, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Leader', 'latitude': 36.62894821166992, 'longitude': -91.77375793457031, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tuli', 'latitude': 42.649959564208984, 'longitude': 18.37748908996582, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'latitude': 42.36565017700195, 'longitude': -71.10832214355469, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cambridge', 'latitude': 42.375099182128906, 'longitude': -71.1056137084961, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'First Citizens Bank', 'latitude': 35.728641510009766, 'longitude': -78.63935852050781, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"First Republic Bank veteran Vitaliy Schafer joins Leader Bank to pursue clients in the Boston-area tech economy.

Those closures came sooner than an initial year-end estimate provided in June. JPMorgan Chase entered into a deal to purchase the failed bank on May 1 after it was seized by regulators, capping a steep decline for the San Francisco-based lender, which became the largest bank to close since the Great Financial Crisis. From its 1985 founding, it grew to become the third-largest bank in the Bay Area and the 14th-largest in the country at the end of last year. It catered to high-net-worth individuals, with roughly 40% of its deposits originating in the Bay Area, and was known for attractive mortgage rates and high-touch customer service, gaining a base of loyal customers and longtime employees. As part of that acquisition, JPMorgan announced plans to shut down 21 First Republic locations across eight states—roughly a quarter of the bank’s branches—Reuters reported. “These locations have relatively low transaction volumes and are generally within a short drive from another First Republic office,” a JPMorgan spokesperson said in a statement. “Clients should expect to continue to receive the same level of service with seamless access to their money.” A major lender and employer in the Bay Area, First Republic was considered a cornerstone of the region's real estate sector.

It's a wrap for First Republic after nearly four decades. AFP via Getty Images Key Facts January 13: First Republic delivers seemingly strong financial results from the last quarter of 2022, topping analysts’ earnings estimates, but the company reveals its interest expenses surged some 2,040% year-over-year and 153% from the prior quarter, in what turned out to largely be the death knell for the bank as it failed to navigate the Federal Reserve’s 2022-23 interest rate hike campaign. March 8: Fellow California bank Silvergate Capital announces it will cease operations as it failed to recover from solvency challenges spurred by its dealings with cryptocurrency flameouts such as FTX, while Silicon Valley Bank stokes panic among customers after it revealed the sale of $2 billion in debt securities at a loss to shore up liquidity. March 10: Financial regulators close Silicon Valley Bank in a stunning mid-day move as the bank proved incapable of meeting withdrawal requests; shares of First Republic slide 29% between March 8 and March 10 as investors look to minimize exposure to arguably Silicon Valley Bank’s closest peer. March 12: The crypto-happy, New York-based Signature Bank fails, while federal regulators announce they will guarantee depositors above the $250,000 limit at Signature and Silicon Valley Banks—the second and third-biggest banks to ever fail in the U.S. at the time. March 16: After shares of First Republic fall a further 62% from March 10 as the bank’s leadership failed to calm investors about its outlook, a consortium of the 11 largest American banks injected First Republic with a total of $30 billion in uninsured deposits in a government-backed move. March 19-20: Bank failures go abroad as the Swiss government orchestrates UBS’ takeover of its ailing rival Credit Suisse on March 19, while the rescue efforts for First Republic gain little traction as its stock cratered nearly 50% to an all-time low March 20. April 24: Following a fairly quiet month for First Republic (its share prices actually rose nearly 25%), the bank delivers a downright dreadful earnings report, disclosing it suffered a 41% outflow in deposits during the first quarter of 2023, sparking reports about the Biden Administration scrambling to find a solution for the bank and its stock sliding all the way down to $8, nearly 95% below its early March share price. May 1: First Republic is officially no longer after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announces the closure of the bank and the sale of most of its deposits and assets to JPMorgan Chase; JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon confirms to analysts his firm won’t retain First Republic name and branding, writing the final chapter in the coffin for the bank’s 38-year history. Key Background The target federal funds rate, which sets the cost of borrowing between banks and is determined by the Fed, sits at 4.75% to 5%, a nearly 20-year high and up from near 0% in March 2022. Higher interest rates make banks’ cost of doing business much steeper, and the failures of First Republic, Silicon Valley and Signature Banks can largely be traced to their ill-preparedness for changes to rates. “The balance sheets of the three failed banks shared a vulnerability to rising rates that exceeds that of most other regional banks,” Wells Fargo strategist Paul Christopher explained in a Monday note to clients. Surprising Fact Though this year’s three bank failures fall far short of the several dozen failing every year between 2008 and 2013, 2023 is by far the most costly year ever for bank failures measured by the shuttered institution’s assets, according to LPL Financial research.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) By KEN SWEET Published [hour]:[minute] [AMPM] [timezone], [monthFull] [day], [year] Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print NEW YORK (AP) — Depositors at First Republic Bank pulled more than $100 billion out of the bank during last month’s crisis, as fears swirled that it could be the third bank to fail after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. San Francisco-based First Republic said Monday that it was only able to staunch the bleeding after a group of large banks stepped in to save it by depositing $30 billion in uninsured deposits. It said it now plans to sell off assets and restructure its balance sheet, and lay off as much as a quarter of its workforce, which totaled about 7,200 employees at the end of 2022. Its stock tumbled more than 20% in after-hours trading Monday. First Republic reported first-quarter results Monday that showed it had $173.5 billion in deposits before Silicon Valley Bank failed on March 9. On April 21, it had deposits of $102.7 billion, including the $30 billion the big banks deposited. It said since late March, its deposits have been relatively stable. “We continue to take steps to strengthen our business,” Jim Herbert, the bank’s executive chairman and Mike Roffler, the bank’s CEO, said in a joint statement. Bank executives did not take questions from industry analysts during a call Monday about the quarterly results. READ MORE Japan’s central bank survey finds less optimistic manufacturers, but happier service sector Swiss central bank makes a surprise cut to its key interest rate as others hold steady Czech Republic’s central bank cuts a key interest rate again to help the economy as inflation falls Before the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic had a banking franchise that was the envy of most of the industry. Its clients, mostly the rich and powerful, rarely defaulted on their loans. The bank made much of its money making low-cost loans to the rich, which reportedly included Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Even through the crisis triggered by the collapse of the two banks, First Republic’s book of loans more than 90 days past due was zero. But its franchise became a liability when bank customers and analysts noted that the vast majority of First Republic’s deposits, like those in Silicon Valley and Signature Bank, were uninsured — that is, above the $250,000 limit set by the FDIC — which meant that if First Republic were to fail, its depositors would be at risk of not getting all their money back. The bank said its profits fell 33% in the three-month period that ended March 31 from a year earlier, and revenues were down 13%.

JPMorgan acquired most of First Republic’s assets earlier this month after the San Francisco-based regional bank was seized by the government. It marked the second-biggest bank failure in US history. A JPMorgan spokesperson told CNN that the bank updated all First Republic employees on Thursday about their future employment status and the vast majority — or nearly 85% — have been offered a transitional or full-time role. That leaves 15%, or about 1,000, First Republic employees who are not receiving an employment offer. News of the job impact was previously reported by the Financial Times. JPMorgan said the company’s May 1 deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to buy most of First Republic did not include all of the company’s employees. “We’ve been transparent with their employees and kept our promise to update them on their employment status within 30 days,” JPMorgan said in a statement. “We recognize that they have been under stress and uncertainty since March and hope that today will bring clarity and closure.” The bank said that employees who have not been offered a role will receive pay and benefits covering 60 days and will be offered a package that includes an additional lump sum as well as continuing benefits coverage and resources to find new opportunities. It’s not clear how many First Republic employees that have been offered employment at JPMorgan will have full-time versus transitional roles. The transitional roles being offered to some First Republic employees will last for a period of between three and 12 months, JPMorgan said. After regulators shut First Republic down, JPMorgan won a competitive bidding process run by the FDIC. JPMorgan agreed to make a $10.6 billion payment to the corporation. Some progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have been critical of the First Republic deal because it allowed America’s biggest bank to get even bigger.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230525195841-jpmorgan-chase-052023.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-05-26,-0.096,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CNN', 'latitude': 51.54853820800781, 'longitude': -0.09250999987125397, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mass', 'latitude': 10.008580207824707, 'longitude': 139.72137451171875, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not directly related,"JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank's assets, resulting in job losses for 15% (about 1,000) of First Republic's employees.

First Republic Bank collapse is a reminder why we need reform - PIRG,First Republic Bank collapse is a reminder why we need reform  PIRG,"Thu, 11 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcGlyZy5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZmlyc3QtcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1jb2xsYXBzZS1pcy1hLXJlbWluZGVyLXdoeS13ZS1uZWVkLXJlZm9ybS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,PIRG,"The recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the second-largest bank failure ever. Then, on May 1, regulators seized and sold First Republic Bank. Why are these banks failing right now? Here’s one reason: In 2018, the Trump administration and Congress weakened critical regulations that were meant to prevent these kinds of collapses. Bank failures are dangerous and costly. In addition to putting the finances of depositors at risk, these failures have ripple effects across the entire economy. Already, it’s becoming harder for consumers and businesses to obtain loans, it seems likely that other small and midsize banks could be at risk in the near future. But our elected officials have a chance to restore some much-needed safeguards that would help prevent more bank collapses from happening. That’s why we’re Congress to pass the Secure Viable Banking Act, which would restore depositor protections and protect against bank failures. Weak bank safety standards are leading to costly failures The SVB failure also led to the failure of Signature Bank in New York. First Republic Bank, headquartered in California, also experienced a bank run and had to receive a bailout — before ultimately folding entirely. All three banks had one thing in common: They had assets between $50 billion and $250 billion. That range is significant because, during the Trump administration, Congress passed a law rolling back regulations for banks of this size. The rollbacks raised the threshold for when and which banks are required to undergo stress tests or submit so-called “living wills” — both safety valves designed to avoid financial disaster. (These safeguards were first codified in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which PIRG helped pass in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. We opposed reversing them five years ago, and are hopeful this Congress will bring them back.) The Secure Viable Banking Act will help protect consumers Enter the Secure Viable Banking Act, introduced by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), U.S. Rep. Katie Porter (Calif.) and others.

What Happened to First Republic Bank? - Investopedia,What Happened to First Republic Bank?

The bank suffered from a run on deposits just weeks after the collapse of two other large regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. All of them had large amounts of uninsured deposits. What Was First Republic Bank? First Republic Bank was a San Francisco-based regional bank focused on high-net-worth clients. It closed in 2023 and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase. Part of the reason why it failed was because a large proportion of its deposits exceeded the limit for coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). The FDIC covers up to $250,000 per account holder, per account type. So, if a bank fails, depositors’ funds are protected for up to that amount. But anything over that is generally not considered covered. As of December 2022, 67.4% of First Republic’s deposits were uninsured, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data analysis. Following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, many First Republic customers with uninsured funds became concerned about holding their money at a regional bank, which led to a run on deposits. Just before its collapse, First Republic had $103.9 billion in deposits and $229.1 billion in assets. JPMorgan Chase acquired the majority of its assets and rebranded 84 branches in eight states, opening them on May 1, 2023. As a result, First Republic’s customers had uninterrupted service, and their funds—even their uninsured deposits—were safe. First Republic’s demise marked the third bank failure in 2023, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according to the Federal Reserve’s failed-bank list. In total, the three banks had a combined $548.5 billion in assets, which was more than the total assets for all the failed banks in 2008, the height of the financial crisis. Each First Republic client had a “First Republic Relationship Manager” who served as a point of contact for personalized service. Services focused on private banking and private wealth management as well as private business banking. Private banking and private wealth management: Services included mortgage and personal lending and accounts for checking, savings, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Private wealth management provided investment management, financial planning, foreign exchange, trust administration and custody, and brokerage and insurance services.Private business banking: Personalized business banking and lending services focused on industries like venture capital, private equity funds, hedge funds and firms, and investment management firms. Other target industries included property management and real estate investors, private clubs, independent schools, medical practices, and wineries. History of First Republic Bank First Republic Bank was founded in 1985 by James H. Herbert II to focus on jumbo mortgages, CDs, and savings accounts. The bank operated in San Francisco, specializing in lending for luxury homes, second homes, condos and co-ops, and investment properties. In the late 1990s, First Republic expanded into a full-service bank and added new services and markets on the West Coast and East Coast. Over the following decades, First Republic built its reputation on having fewer customer accounts with more individualized service and continued to focus on high-net-wealth clients. In 2007, First Republic merged with Merrill Lynch, which in turn was acquired by Bank of America in 2008. In 2010, Herbert raised private equity capital and secured regulatory approval to buy back First Republic. Why Did First Republic Bank Fail? First Republic Bank failed for many of the same reasons that Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank failed, including the fact that it carried a significant amount of uninsured deposits and struggled with liquidity. Like SVB, it focused part of its business on startups in Silicon Valley that held balances much higher than $250,000, according to news reports. Compounding this was the broader fear among investors over regional banks. Uninsured deposits: A high number of uninsured deposits can contribute to a bank run when investors start to panic. First Republic’s wealthy customer base had a high proportion of uninsured deposits, with more than 67% of the bank’s deposits being uninsured as of December 2022. Lack of liquidity: First Republic’s primary income source was net interest income from loans and investment securities. Many of its investments were in real estate loans and municipal securities, which were less liquid and not earning competitive interest rates. Among midsize banks, First Republic had the highest ratio of loans and securities to uninsured deposits in December 2022. Credit ratings downgrades: First Republic Bank faced repeated credit agency downgrades due to concerns that infusions wouldn’t resolve its challenges with liquidity, funding, and profitability. Mistrust in regional banks: Due to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier in the year, along with credit ratings downgrades, investors were increasingly concerned about keeping uninsured deposits with a regional bank. First Republic began borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLB) and Federal Reserve and accepted a $30 billion cash infusion from a consortium of 11 banks as its deposits started rapidly declining after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Meanwhile, its share price plunged from $122.50 on March 1, 2023, to $3.51 on April 28, 2023. Timeline of the 2023 Collapse 2022 Dec. 31: First Republic met all capital ratio requirements to be “well-capitalized.” However, the bank had already borrowed $14 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLB). 2023 Feb. 28: First Republic’s annual report outlined its challenges, including the fact that most of its loan portfolio was secured by real estate and concentrated in California and the San Francisco Bay Area. The report noted that the bank “experienced rapid migration of deposits to higher yielding products and asset classes” due to rising interest rates. March 6: FRB’s stock fell more than 75% within days and never recovered. March 10: Silicon Valley Bank was closed by the FDIC, and First Republic began experiencing what it called “unprecedented deposit outflows.” March 12: The FDIC closed Signature Bank. March 15–19: Numerous credit rating agencies downgraded First Republic’s credit rating, signaling a lack of confidence in the bank. March 16: To boost First Republic’s liquidity, 11 banks contributed $30 billion in uninsured deposits. March 31: First Republic Bank had borrowed $105.4 billion from Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLB) funding. April 24: The bank indicated it was headed toward collapse as deposits declined almost 41% from December 2022. It announced plans to reduce its workforce by up to 25%, among other cost-cutting steps. April 28: First Republic could not access more funding after $121.3 billion in outstanding borrowings from the Federal Reserve and FHLB funds. News outlets reported that the FDIC planned to find buyers for First Republic. May 1: JPMorgan Chase acquired a substantial majority of First Republic Bank’s assets. Impact on Depositors and Investors First Republic customers had uninterrupted service and their money was ultimately safe after the acquisition by JPMorgan Chase. As of May 5, 2023, the plan was to transition First Republic’s platforms and operations to JPMorgan Chase’s technology over time. Some existing First Republic branches were expected to be converted into J.P. Morgan wealth centers, and the bank’s private wealth management platform was slated to be merged with J.P. Morgan Advisors. Why Do Banks Keep Failing? Several common contributing factors led to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank (as well as Silvergate Capital) in early 2023. These include the banks’ high proportion of uninsured deposits and a focus on overly niche markets, such as venture capitalists in the case of SVB and commercial real estate in the case of Signature Bank. Following the collapse of SVB, investors were more motivated to move their uninsured deposits out of regional banks to protect their funds. The banks were also struggling with asset issues. During the COVID-19 pandemic, historically low interest rates led to banks amassing larger commercial and real estate lending portfolios. As interest rates rose in 2022, lending slowed, and banks were stuck with low-rate loans while paying higher interest rates to customers. The Bottom Line First Republic Bank was among a few regional banks that failed in early 2023 due to bank runs driven in part by the high volume of uninsured deposits that they carried, along with financial struggles caused by the broader interest rate environment. To ensure your funds are safe, consider keeping an amount under the minimum FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 in your bank account. If you need to deposit more than that, you could open another account at a different bank.

First Republic: What happens to deposits and shareholders now? - CBS News,First Republic: What happens to deposits and shareholders now?  CBS News,"Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZmlyc3QtcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1zdG9jay1kZXBvc2l0cy1zaGFyZWhvbGRlcnMtY2JzLWV4cGxhaW5zL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2ZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLWJhbmstc3RvY2stZGVwb3NpdHMtc2hhcmVob2xkZXJzLWNicy1leHBsYWlucy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CBS News,"First Republic Bank was teetering for weeks before it was seized early Monday by regulators, who then accepted a bid from banking giant JPMorgan Chase to acquire almost all of its assets. That move is leading to a host of questions about what happens next, such as the sale's impact on depositors and shareholders. Here's what to know about the bank's collapse.Why did First Republic Bank collapse?The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation took over First Republic early Monday because the regulator had determined that the bank was conducting its business in an ""unsound manner."" The California regulator then appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the bank's receiver.The collapse follows the March seizure by regulators of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, both of which had experienced bank runs. Like Silicon Valley Bank, a significant share of First Republic's deposits were uninsured because they exceeded the $250,000 insurance protection that is offered by the FDIC. Such banks are more vulnerable to bank runs because nervous depositors are prone to withdraw their assets at the first sign of trouble.Regulators assumed control of First Republic one week after the bank's executives revealed that customers had withdrawn more than $100 billion during a panic last month. Why are banks failing?Silicon Valley, Signature Bank and First Republic failed partly due to their unusual reliance on wealthy individuals and companies, including unprofitable startups, combined with the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes.Those higher rates have made it more expensive for startups and other businesses to borrow money, which meant many of them were burning through their cash deposits and withdrawing money at faster rates. When Silicon Valley Bank sought to shore up its balance sheet by selling bonds — at a loss — it spooked depositors, who then withdrew even more funds. Depositors at other banks soon followed, leading to large withdrawals at other midsize banks that were forced to borrow from federal programs to shore up their balance sheets. None were hit as hard as First Republic, however.Didn't big banks already pour money into First Republic?Yes, a group of large banks provided $30 billion in funding in mid-March to help stabilize First Republic in the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank failure. To turn itself around, the bank planned to sell off unprofitable assets, including the low-interest mortgages that it provided to wealthy clients. It also announced plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, which totaled about 7,200 employees in late 2022.Investors were skeptical, and a recent devastating quarterly report sent them running for the exits. First Republic shares fell 75% last week and closed Friday at $3.51. Who bought First Republic Bank?JPMorgan Chase — one of the banks that contributed part of the $30 billion in March — has bought the bulk of the bank's operations and assets from the FDIC. The banking giant is acquiring $92 billion in insured and uninsured deposits and will assume $173 billion in loans as well as $30 billion in securities, according to a Monday note from Benjamin Salisbury at Height Securities. The FDIC and JPMorgan will share losses on acquired single-family residential mortgage loans and commercial loans. ""This is an extraordinary series of events,"" noted Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg on Monday. Regulators ""permitted the country's biggest bank to get even bigger.""How much did JPMorgan pay for First Republic Bank?JPMorgan is paying the FDIC $10.6 billion for First Republic, according to Ben Emons of NewEdge Wealth, in a research note. As part of the deal, JPMorgan will absorb about $185 billion of First Republic assets, he noted.JPMorgan ""is now the largest depository institution in the U.S., holding 16.7% of the $17.1 trillion deposits,"" he added.What happens to First Republic Bank's stock and shareholders?The shareholders are most likely wiped out. The stock has stopped trading as of Monday, and shareholders won't receive stock in JPMorgan, according to a JPMorgan spokesman. The New York Stock Exchange said on Tuesday that it is delisting First Republic's shares.The FDIC's insurance fund has a priority claim on the bank's assets, which must be fully reimbursed before the next class of creditors — general trade creditors — can get reimbursed, according to the FDIC. The FDIC estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund at about $13 billion. After that, claims from unsubordinated debt holders are reimbursed. ""If there are any proceeds left, the shareholders are the last in line,"" an FDIC spokesperson said.Shareholders have already taken a wallop. Before entering receivership on Monday, First Republic shares had lost 97% of their value since year start, wiping out more than $21 billion off First Republic's market value.Before it stopped trading, First Republic had a market valuation of about $660 million, according to FactSet. What happens to First Republic Bank deposits?The First Republic deal announced Monday means customers will be able to access all of their money, according to the FDIC. First Republic branches will change to JPMorgan Chase branches and First Republic customers will become JPMorgan Chase customers.""First Republic clients may bank as usual, and feel confident that their deposits are backed by the strength and security of JPMorgan Chase,"" the bank said in an investor presentation on Monday.Is First Republic Bank the same as Republic Bank?No. There are a couple of banks with names similar to First Republic that aren't related.Republic Bank, a Philadelphia-based bank that provides banking services to customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, is trying to get the word out that they aren't related. In a statement on its website, Republic Bank notes, ""What is happening at the California-based bank, one of the nation's largest, has no local impact on Republic Bank.""There's also Republic Bank & Trust in Kentucky, which also is alerting customers on its website that it is ""not related to First Republic Bank.""How big was First Republic Bank?The bank had $229 billion in assets, making it the second-biggest bank to collapse in U.S. history after the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual, which at the time had roughly $307 billion and also was sold to JPMorgan.

Government officials stepped in early Monday after efforts from the bank's executives failed to reach a deal. The FDIC then sold all of the bank's deposits and most of its assets. According to regulators, First Republic Bank's 84 branches in eight states will reopen as branches of JPMorgan Chase. Depositors will have full access to all of their deposits on Monday, May 1, 2023. The San Francisco-based bank has been at the center of the regional banking crisis since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in early March. The company was the focus of a rescue deal, with 11 of the largest U.S. banks depositing a total of $30 billion in the firm. Deposits fell more than 40% in the first quarter, even with the money from other institutions. Other banks had been reluctant to make a deal because their rescue deposits were uninsured.

This result is especially welcome for the government politically because by the time it failed, a large number of the uninsured deposits at First Republic were simply money that had been poured in by big banks. Backing those deposits would have been a bad look to the public. But failing to do so would’ve signaled that the government wouldn’t necessarily stand behind any deposits at failing banks — jeopardizing a convenient ambiguity that has helped stabilize the system, at least for now. Still, the FDIC expects to take a $13 billion loss to its deposit insurance fund, financed by fees from banks. That’s because it’s sharing some of the losses from First Republic’s portfolio of residential mortgages and commercial loans. Are more banks going to fail? It’s very possible, but there are no obvious candidates teetering the way First Republic has been. And all three of those failed banks shared clear links: lots of runnable deposits and huge unrealized losses on their books. Financial regulators are keeping an eye out for other risks that accompany higher borrowing costs, such as the potential for losses on commercial real estate, which has been in a period of sustained uncertainty in the wake of the pandemic as large numbers of workers no longer use office space. No doubt other financial firms will experience trouble as interest rates stay high and growth slows. Some might not be banks; government officials worry in particular about nonbank companies such as asset managers and insurers that are less regulated but still interconnected with the banking system. In the meantime, what will matter for the economy is to what extent the stress in the banking system leads lenders to pull back on extending credit, which could slow growth as much as would any further interest rate hikes. So wait, isn’t JPMorgan Chase already huge? Now it’s going to get bigger? This will definitely be a political talking point as Washington looks over the details of the sale. On the one hand, the FDIC selling an insolvent bank to another bank, and sharing in the losses, is generally how bank failures play out. But a lot of Democrats won’t love that a bank they consider “too big to fail” is now getting even bigger. Indeed, JPMorgan normally is barred from buying other banks because it controls more than 10 percent of the deposits in the country. But that cap doesn’t apply when the bank being bought is insolvent. To put things in perspective, First Republic had about $229 billion in assets, the second-largest bank failure in history, behind only Washington Mutual. JPMorgan has more than $3.7 trillion in assets. (One side note: Washington Mutual was also bought by JPMorgan after its collapse in 2008.)",https://static.politico.com/31/0c/7697e0ee402a9a614fa3fa51fd70/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1473331011,2023-05-01,-0.213,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Washington Mutual', 'description': 'former American bank holding company', 'full_name': 'Washington Mutual', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Washington_Mutual_Tower%2C_Seattle%2C_August_2006.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 48.64822006225586, 'longitude': -118.73780822753906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",Not directly related,"First Republic Bank's failure resulted in a $13 billion loss for the FDIC, which shared losses from its mortgage and loan portfolio.

Jamie Dimon says chance of a bad economy is ‘higher than other people think’ - CNN,Jamie Dimon says chance of a bad economy is ‘higher than other people think’  CNN,"Fri, 12 Apr 2024 14:15:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNC8xMi9pbnZlc3RpbmcvanBtb3JnYW4tY2hhc2UtYmFuay1lYXJuaW5ncy1xMS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNC8xMi9pbnZlc3RpbmcvanBtb3JnYW4tY2hhc2UtYmFuay1lYXJuaW5ncy1xMQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States, kicked off earnings season Friday with a beat, but also a warning about geopolitical threats that could hurt the global economy. The bank’s first-quarter revenue increased by 9% from the year before, to $41.9 billion. That’s more than analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected. Earnings per share came in at $4.44, also higher than the $4.17 estimated by FactSet. Still, CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors that trouble could lie ahead. “Many economic indicators continue to be favorable. However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces,” he wrote in a press release Friday. Dimon cited growing geopolitical tensions and “persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue,” as ongoing worries. “We do not know how these factors will play out, but we must prepare the Firm for a wide range of potential environments to ensure that we can consistently be there for clients,” he said. On a call with reporters Friday morning, Dimon said American consumers still have excess savings, stocks are higher and unemployment is low. “Even if we go into recession, they’re in pretty good shape,” he noted. But he also said that lower-income earners are quickly running out of extra money. The bank is beginning to see some cracks in the subprime auto loan market. Dimon, calling in from an investment banking conference in Florida, told reporters that he believes market pricing is likely “too happy” right now and that the chance of a bad outcome is “higher than other people think.” But, Dimon said, “the important thing isn’t the economy — whether we have a mild recession or soft landing or something like that,” he said, referring to a scenario where inflation is vanquished without raising unemployment levels. What’s important, he said, “is the future of the free world,” referring to Russia’s war on Ukraine. “It could be determinative on what happens to the global economy if oil and gas prices go too high,” Dimon said. The impact of ‘higher for longer’ rates JPMorgan Chase acquired most of First Republic Bank’s assets last May after the San Francisco-based regional bank was seized by the government. That acquisition added billions of dollars in loans to the bank’s balance sheet, boosting its income from interest. JPMorgan Chase reported that average loans had increased 16% from the year before, mostly because of First Republic. Net interest income, or NII, from those loans (that’s the money a bank earns from loans minus the interest it pays on deposits) increased by 11% to $23.2 billion. But the bank also said that NII could fall short of Wall Street expectations for the year. Net interest income has been a key metric for analysts this quarter as they look to see how banks react to elevated interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Banks, including JPMorgan, have brought in record profits, boosted by NII, as the central bank raised interest rates. JPMorgan Chase also said on Friday that it would take a one-time $725 million charge by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation related to the mess that Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank left in the wake of their collapses last spring. It was large banks that mostly footed that bill. Shares of the bank fell by 4.3% in morning trading but are up 45% over the last 12 months. Mixed earnings Separately, investment giant BlackRock reported that its assets under management swelled to a record $10.5 trillion during the first quarter. The company also beat top- and bottom-line expectations. Wells Fargo, which also reported its first-quarter earnings Friday, topped Wall Street’s expectations but saw an 8% decline in net interest income from the prior year. The company also noted a $284 million expense during the first quarter related to the FDIC’s special assessment. Citigroup reported net income of $3.4 billion in the first quarter, or $1.58 a share, outpacing analysts’ expectations for $1.18 a share, according to FactSet. CEO Jane Fraser said Friday the bank finished its organizational restructuring, which included layoffs, last month. The company saw $225 million in restructuring charges during the first quarter, largely driven by severance and other corporate reshuffling costs. Citi also noted a $251 million expense related to the FDIC’s cleanup of the regional bank collapses last year. Shares of Wells Fargo were up slightly on Friday morning while shares of BlackRock and Citigroup fell.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1835247155.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2024-04-12,-0.031,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'FactSet', 'description': 'American financial data company', 'full_name': 'FactSet'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Citigroup', 'description': 'American investment bank and financial services corporation', 'full_name': 'Citigroup', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/388_Greenwich_Street_from_Battery_Park_City_North_Esplanade.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dimon', 'latitude': 64.12834167480469, 'longitude': -19.906320571899414, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Florida', 'latitude': 28.750539779663086, 'longitude': -82.5000991821289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Russia', 'latitude': 60.0, 'longitude': 100.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ukraine', 'latitude': 49.0, 'longitude': 32.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NII', 'latitude': 35.23332977294922, 'longitude': 134.7833251953125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wall Street', 'latitude': 34.590370178222656, 'longitude': -86.82611083984375, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 47.92502975463867, 'longitude': 19.173559188842773, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'BlackRock', 'latitude': 36.929100036621094, 'longitude': -118.23342895507812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Citi', 'latitude': 9.51846981048584, 'longitude': -69.33296203613281, 'location_type': 'REGION'}]",Not directly related,"JPMorgan Chase acquired most of First Republic Bank's assets last May, boosting its loan portfolio and net interest income by 11%.

Why Fund Managers See Value In Charles Schwab - Forbes,Why Fund Managers See Value In Charles Schwab  Forbes,"Tue, 09 Apr 2024 21:50:54 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFjb2J3b2xpbnNreS8yMDI0LzA0LzA5L3doeS1mdW5kLW1hbmFnZXJzLXNlZS12YWx1ZS1pbi1jaGFybGVzLXNjaHdhYi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Forbes,"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Financial services giant Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) outperformed in 2022 when the markets were down, but it lagged in 2023 when markets were soaring. While the leading brokerage firm and money manager is not typically viewed as a bank, it does have a significant banking arm, and it took a big hit during last year’s banking crisis. Schwab suffered from deposit outflows during the crisis, as customers took their money out for higher-yielding options, like money markets, during a time of high interest rates. Close-up of sign with logo at Charles Schwab financial adviser branch in Pleasanton, California, ... [+] March 26, 2018. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Getty Images This flight reduced a valuable funding source for the company and forced Schwab to seek out other sources of funding, which were more expensive and ultimately reduced its margins. This hurt earnings and led to several analysts’ downgrades – and the combination of factors caused the stock price to fall more than 30% in Q1 last year to below $50 per share. The sell-off provided the opportunity for investors to snag one of the most reliable, consistent, and best-performing financial stocks at a discount – and several fund managers took advantage of it. A long term bargain Schwab’s stock price did rebound a bit from that initial sell-off, as deposits started to come back in the fourth quarter, up 2% from the third quarter, but still down 21% year-over-year. However, the share price was still down some 16% in 2023 as earnings growth was challenged, in part due to higher expenses related to the integration of TD Ameritrade into the Schwab platform. But now that the integration is mostly complete, the company should see some $500 million in cost savings from the integration starting in 2024. The volatility, however, signaled a green light for portfolio managers at Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, which runs the Sequoia Fund. While Schwab was the worst performing stock in the portfolio last year, the management team could not pass up the chance to buy more shares when it dipped below $50 per share. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor “Rising interest rates have impacted the business in ways both predictable and unpredictable, but the net result has been a crimping of earnings that will likely persist for another year or two. Critically, we do not believe any of these transitory dynamics pose, or ever posed, any existential risk to the business. Further, Schwab’s enviable, high-return franchise remains, in our view, entirely intact. If we are right on both these counts, we should generate an attractive return from the current stock price across a range of long-term interest rate scenarios,” Sequoia Fund managers wrote in their Q4 letter to shareholders. They added that at the discounted price, the stock trades at a low-double-digit multiple of likely earnings per share a couple years – as higher interest rates should ultimately help earnings as deposits continue to come back, particularly as interest rates have likely peaked. Giverny Capital Asset Management also jumped at the opportunity to buy Schwab when it was trading in the $50 per share range – boosting its position several times last year. “I believe in this business and its earnings power over the next few years. However, Schwab qualifies as a poor manager of its own balance sheet,” David Poppe, president and co-founder of Giverny Capital wrote in the Q4 letter to investors. “Unlike First Republic Bank, however, Schwab continued gathering billions of dollars of brokerage assets all year, shoring up its capital position. The flow of new money into Schwab meant it had plenty of capital on hand, even after marking down the value of longer-dated bonds.” Ultimately, Poppe wrote that Schwab has significant long-term earnings power and will “power through its mishap(s).” A different view Ariel Investments, which holds Schwab in its Ariel Appreciation Fund, is also bullish on the stock. Ariel fund managers, in their fourth quarter commentary, said its scale, bolstered by the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, and “customer-centric focus” should enhance its “industry leading cost advantage.” But not all were in lockstep, as Right Tail Capital sold shares in Schwab last March. In his fourth quarter letter to shareholders, Right Tail founder Jeremy Kokemor said that while Schwab was in good shape relative to the troubled and failed banks, with limited uninsured deposits and sticky institutional assets, there were challenges to sort through, like raising capital to deal with the liquidity challenges. “Ultimately, I felt my time and energy would be better spent trying to find the next great Right Tail investment than in trying to untangle Schwab. I sold the stock in the mid to high $50s and used the proceeds to add to our existing positions that I felt best about,” Kokemor wrote. Ultimately, the fund returned 29% in 2023, topping the S&P 500. Schwab’s share price is back up to $71 per share, still short of the $85 per share price it reached before the crisis, but up some 30% to 40% off its lows when it was trading in the low $50s. Analysts rate it as a consensus buy, with a price target of around $75, but the managers who recently added it are looking farther out and see value in the long term.

The lawsuit marks the latest fallout for the FDIC from three bank failures earlier this year that cost the agency's deposit insurance fund about $32 billion and have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The lawsuit was filed on Dec. 5 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California but has not been previously reported. With assets of more than $200 billion, First Republic in May became the largest bank to fail since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, despite efforts by major banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N)New Tab, opens new tab to right the ship, including a $30 billion infusion of deposits in March of this year.

In their complaint, the former employees allege that in mid-May the FDIC stopped payments intended for them under a deferred compensation plan that First Republic had earlier established for them in a trust. They say the FDIC instead began treating them as unsecured creditors, meaning they could be left with nothing. ""It's really inequitable. The employees are the ones that kept the bank healthy and profitable,"" said attorney Timothy Walsh of Winston & Strawn. His clients did not include any of the top executives whose alleged mismanagement contributed to First Republic's demise, Walsh added. ""They should not be penalized in this process."" Walsh said the FDIC's resolution of First Republic protected the Wall Street banks that injected deposits, while the former employees' retirement funds were much smaller. First Republic's failure cost the FDIC about $15 billion, according to a recent estimate.

Its scope covered 2018 until the bank’s failure on May 1. On that day, First Republic announced its sale to JPMorgan Chase, which acquired the majority of its assets and assumed its deposits and certain other liabilities. The transaction was necessitated by stock declines at the bank following the failure of SVB that proved irreversible despite cash injections from other large U.S. banks. “[T]here were attributes of First Republic’s business model and management strategies that made it more vulnerable to interest rate changes and the contagion that ensued following the failure of SVB,” said the FDIC report, including: Rapid growth and loan and funding concentrations; Overreliance on uninsured deposits and depositor loyalty; and Failure to sufficiently mitigate interest rate risk. The report further pointed to the effects of an April 24 earnings call, where it was disclosed the bank lost more than $100 billion in deposits during the first quarter of 2023, as a cause for negative market reaction that could not be overcome. Regarding its supervision of First Republic, the FDIC “could have been more forward-looking in assessing how increasing interest rates could negatively impact the bank” and “could have done more to effectively challenge and encourage bank management to implement strategies to mitigate interest rate risk,” according to the report. The analysis also found the FDIC could have better collaborated with its San Franciso regional office regarding challenging the bank management’s strategies and assumptions. “We cannot say whether taking earlier supervisory action such as criticizing interest rate risk or liquidity risk management would have prevented First Republic from failing given the significance and speed of deposit withdrawals,” the report concluded. “However, meaningful action to mitigate interest rate risk and address funding concentrations would have made the bank more resilient and less vulnerable to the March 2023 contagion event.” The report’s findings mirror those of the Federal Reserve regarding its review of its supervision efforts at SVB published in April. In the aftermath of the collapses, the Fed, FDIC, and other U.S. banking regulators have come together to propose rule changes designed to allow the FDIC greater flexibility in dealing with failing banks.",https://d6jxgaftxvagq.cloudfront.net/Pictures/2000xAny/7/4/7/17747_first_republic_web_332085.jpg,2023-09-11,-0.239,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Marshall', 'latitude': 42.27225875854492, 'longitude': -84.96331024169922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not directly related,"The FDIC report on First Republic's collapse highlights rapid growth, loan concentrations, and interest rate risk as contributing factors.

Revenue for the bank totalled $42.6bn, above expectations of $41.9bn, while earnings per share sat at $4.44, compared to estimates of $4.11. Significantly, the bank posted a $1.9bn provision for credit losses in the quarter, 17 per cent smaller than a year ago and far below the $2.7bn expected by analysts. JPMorgan added billions in loans to its balance sheet after acquiring First Republic Bank last year following its collapse. This pushed average loans up 16 per cent, but these were only up three per cent when First Republic was excluded, while assets under management jumped 19 per cent to $3.6 trillion thanks in part to the acquisition. However, trading revenue declined five per cent to $8bn, while revenue from fixed income, currency and commodities dropped seven per cent. Revenue from equities was flat. Investment banking revenue jumped 27 per cent to $2bn, due to higher fees on debt and stock underwriting. While many other financial institutions are reducing their headcount, JPMorgan actually added around 2,000 employees to its workforce of 311,921, five per cent higher than a year earlier. Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s chair and CEO, said that while many economic indicators were favourable, the bank remained “alert to a number of significant uncertain forces”. He warned of ongoing geopolitical tensions, as well as the “large number of persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue”. Dimon also cautioned about the full effect of quantitative tightening, which he said we have “never truly experienced” on this scale. “We do not know how these factors will play out, but we must prepare the firm for a wide range of potential environments to ensure that we can consistently be there for clients,” the CEO said.",https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-465591431-e1712921430525.jpg,2024-04-12,-0.472,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JP Morgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 37.12166976928711, 'longitude': -93.47138977050781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dimon', 'latitude': 64.12834167480469, 'longitude': -19.906320571899414, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]",Not directly related,"JP Morgan's acquisition of First Republic Bank contributed to a 16% increase in average loans and a 19% jump in assets under management, driving the bank's first-quarter profit surge."

As of year-end 2022, each of the three banks held substantially more FHLBank advances (as a proportion of their total assets) than a group of their peer banks. The three banks increased their outstanding FHLBank advances by 37 to 50 percent in the first 2 weeks of March 2023, when SVB and Signature Bank failed (see table). First Republic Bank’s outstanding advances then largely stabilized until the bank failed on May 1. Percentage Changes in Outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank Advances for Failed Banks, March 1, 2023–Failure Date Source: GAO analysis of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) advance data. | GAO-24-106957 Prior to the three bank failures, the FHLBanks of New York and San Francisco reviewed examination reports for the three failed banks and stated that they met regularly with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Banks, and other regulators. The two FHLBanks and FDIC communicated about Signature Bank and First Republic Bank as the banks were declining. In addition, the two FHLBanks relied on established policies, procedures, and agreements with the relevant Federal Reserve Banks to help Signature Bank and First Republic Bank access additional funding. However, officials from the FHLBank of San Francisco said that SVB failed before they could coordinate with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to request additional supervisory information or facilitate SVB’s access to additional funding. Since the bank failures, the FHLBanks have received full repayment for SVB’s and Signature Bank’s advances. The bank that acquired First Republic Bank’s advances has indicated that it intends to repay the advances according to the advance terms. Why GAO Did This Study Between March 10 and May 1, 2023, state banking supervisors closed SVB, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank and named FDIC as receiver. The three failed banks had borrowed substantial secured loans (known as advances) from their respective FHLBanks before their failures. The FHLBanks are government-sponsored enterprises that support liquidity by making advances to member financial institutions and promote housing and community development. SVB and First Republic Bank were members of the FHLBank of San Francisco, and Signature Bank was a member of the FHLBank of New York. GAO was asked to review the role of the FHLBanks with regard to the recent bank failures. This report provides information on the FHLBanks’ funding to the failed banks, their communication and coordination with FDIC and the Federal Reserve System (the failed banks’ primary federal regulators), and repayment of the failed banks’ outstanding advances. This report is one in a series of reports about the bank failures. GAO plans to follow this report with work on broader issues related to the FHLBanks. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations; publications, policies, procedures, and other documentation and data from the FHLBanks and the federal banking regulators; and publicly available regulatory reporting data for the three failed banks. GAO also interviewed officials from the FHLBanks, federal banking regulators, and others.

4 Key Takeaways From Jamie Dimon's Annual Shareholder Letter - Investopedia,4 Key Takeaways From Jamie Dimon's Annual Shareholder Letter  Investopedia,"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 16:37:43 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vNC1rZXktdGFrZWF3YXlzLWZyb20tamFtaWUtZGltb24tYW5udWFsLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLWxldHRlci04NjI4MTk30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Investopedia,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chair and CEO Jamie Dimon released his annual letter to shareholders Monday, giving his perspective on a range of topics from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) to the health of the economy and its outlook. The influential CEO also touched on America's role in international conflicts, climate change, and JPMorgan's plans to support a number of initiatives related to diversity and inclusion, among other things. JPMorgan shares were up about 0.5% at $198.44 in early trading Monday after Dimon's letter was released, as well as the company's annual proxy statement in which it said a transition to a new CEO is a ""top priority"" for the medium term. Growing Role of AI Amid a boom in demand in AI, Dimon highlighted the ""critical impact"" of the technology, and said that JPMorgan has taken a number of steps to expand its capabilities with AI. Dimon said the company currently uses AI in over 400 different ways, from fraud detection to finding new marketing strategies, with plans to explore whether using generative AI for things like customer service or software development could help the business. ""While we do not know the full effect or the precise rate at which AI will change our business—or how it will affect society at large—we are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others,"" Dimon wrote. Soft Landing Could Be Less Likely Than Markets Expect While the markets are currently pricing an a 70% to 80% chance of the economy executing a ""soft landing,"" with modest growth and declining inflation and interest rates, Dimon said ""I believe the odds are a lot lower than that."" Dimon said JPMorgan is prepared to weather a wide range of circumstances, including interest rates from 2% to 8%, and a recession to a strong economy. He also warned against focusing too much on monthly inflation data or slight changes to interest rates, when pressures like high government spending and restructuring of global trade could keep inflation high. Rising Regulatory Requirements In his letter, Dimon noted the financial industry has seen thousands of new rules introduced since the Dodd-Frank Act enacted after the 2008 financial crisis, and argued in favor of reevaluating some regulatory steps taken. ""It would probably be an understatement to say that some are duplicative, inconsistent, procyclical, contradictory, extremely costly, and unnecessarily painful for both banks and regulators,"" he said, writing many banks from smaller banks to larger regional banks ""may not have the resources to handle all of these regulatory requirements."" Greater collaboration between banks and regulators, Dimon said, ""would reduce confusion and uncertainty and would lead to better outcomes for banks, their shareholders, and their clients, customers and communities."" Update on First Republic Acquisition in Aftermath of 2023 Banking Crisis After nearly a year since its purchase of First Republic Bank, Dimon said JPMorgan expects to have most of its integration of First Republic Bank's systems with JPMorgan's policies and existing systems complete by later this year. JPMorgan now projects First Republic will add about $2 billion to its annual revenue, compared to initial estimates of $500 million. ""By purchasing First Republic Bank, we brought much-needed stability to the U.S. banking system,"" Dimon wrote, noting ""when we purchased First Republic in May 2023 following the failure of two other regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, we thought that the current banking crisis was over."" However, Dimon warned that if interest rates rise or there is a recession, “there will be plenty of stress—not just in the banking system but with leveraged companies and others.”",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/jMhk1uq5sNtMBPswMtu1UBs-lLQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1835546589-bd8b6187fde445099135e9351a25b68d.jpg,2024-04-08,0.063,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dimon', 'latitude': 64.12834167480469, 'longitude': -19.906320571899414, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dodd', 'latitude': 40.287200927734375, 'longitude': -103.70745086669922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank in 2023, stabilizing the U.S. banking system after the failure of SVB and Signature Bank.

FDIC Terminates First Republic's 212K SF Hudson Yards Office Lease - Bisnow,FDIC Terminates First Republic's 212K SF Hudson Yards Office Lease  Bisnow,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpc25vdy5jb20vbmV3LXlvcmsvbmV3cy9vZmZpY2UvZmRpYy10ZXJtaW5hdGVzLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljcy0yMTJrLXNmLWh1ZHNvbi15YXJkcy1sZWFzZS0xMjE2MDHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Bisnow,"Following its failure earlier this year, First Republic Bank's large new Hudson Yards office space is getting handed back over to its landlord, Bisnow has learned. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has terminated First Republic's 212K SF lease at 410 10th Ave., an executive with 601W Cos., which owns the building, told Bisnow. JPMorgan Chase bought most of First Republic's assets from the FDIC in May, but it never took over the space in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of Manhattan, a JPMorgan spokesperson said Friday. The FDIC took possession of the lease from First Republic in late September and has been working on a termination agreement with 601W Cos. that went into effect within the last 10 days, said the 601W executive, who declined to be identified because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. The FDIC didn't immediately respond to Bisnow’s request for comment, although federal and local government agencies are closed Friday in observance of Veterans Day. First Republic pre-leased the Class-A office space at 410 10th Ave. in 2019 from SL Green, which acquired the property and undertook a $240M gut renovation. Amazon is the largest tenant at the 640K SF building, occupying 330K SF in a lease that expires in 2037, according to the Morningstar Credit database. 601W Cos. bought the building in December 2020 for $953M, then the largest office sale in the U.S. since the onset of the pandemic. JPMorgan Chase provided a $705M debt package for the acquisition, The Real Deal reported, which was securitized into several CMBS loans that are set to mature in 2028. The senior debt totals $565M, with another $140M in mezzanine financing, according to documents filed when the loan was securitized. First Republic’s lease in the building was due to expire in September 2036. The request for a lease termination triggered a clause in the loan for 601W Cos. that requires the borrower to deposit all excess cash flow from 410 10th Ave. into an account controlled by the loan's servicer. The servicer placed the loan on a watchlist as a result. The building is cash flow-positive even without rent from First Republic, the executive said, adding that the landlord is already speaking to at least two tenants looking to occupy the space left by the failed bank. The space is being marketed by JLL. First Republic moved into the fully furnished space in 2020, but because of the pandemic and flexible work policies, it “never fully occupied it,” according to the executive. “It’s not the outcome we wanted, for First Republic to leave, but we have the bones that you want in a building,” the person said. Other tenants in the building include bakery Maman, which has a ground-floor lease in the property, and Hudson Yards Construction LLC, which occupies 38K SF in a lease due to expire next month, according to Morningstar Credit's database. Rents in the area have increased since the onset of the pandemic, the spokesperson said. Asking rents for Class-A properties in the Penn Station submarket, where 410 10th Ave. sits, were $118.67 per SF during the third quarter, according to Cushman & Wakefield data. The submarket's vacancy rate was 22.5%. The termination shows that the dust still hasn't settled following regional bank collapses this spring. Credit Suisse, Signature Bank and First Republic occupied approximately 2M SF in New York City alone as of March.

The most significant trades included a boost to the PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL, Financial) position, reduced bets on Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial), Meta Platforms Inc. (META, Financial) and Visa Inc. (V, Financial) and the divestment of First Republic Bank (FRCB, Financial).

FDIC OIG report identifies areas for improvement in First Republic Bank's oversight - American Banker,FDIC OIG report identifies areas for improvement in First Republic Bank's oversight  American Banker,"Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZkaWMtb2lnLXJlcG9ydC1pZGVudGlmaWVzLWFyZWFzLWZvci1pbXByb3ZlbWVudC1pbi1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1iYW5rcy1vdmVyc2lnaHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,American Banker,"WASHINGTON — First Republic Bank's May failure followed the dramatic failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the preceding weeks, and a new report from the the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s inspector general suggests the FDIC may have missed some opportunities to more effectively address risks leading up to the firm's collapse. A material-loss review commissioned by the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General shed light on the circumstances leading to the failure of First Republic Bank. The comprehensive examination, conducted by Cotton & Company Assurance and Advisory, said the FDIC could have implemented more timely supervisory actions, including downgrading the firm's component ratings and reassessing guidance concerning the substantial quantity of uninsured deposits that ultimately fled from the bank. The report emphasizes the need for the agency to take a hard look at some of the triggers the agency uses to define bank health, saying the agency’s current capital measures classified the bank as well-capitalized up until its failure. ""The bank’s failure may warrant changes to the guidelines establishing standards for safety and soundness, including the adoption of noncapital triggers requiring regulatory actions,"" the report notes. The Inspector General of the FDIC is required to conduct material loss reviews following the failure of a financial institution to determine the causes that led to the institution's downfall and resulted in a material loss to the deposit insurance fund. The material-loss review attributed the demise of San Francisco-based First Republic to contagion effects stemming from the failure of other major financial institutions like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank months prior. The review noted a run on deposits severely impacted the bank's liquidity, revealing vulnerabilities in its business strategy. The review also pointed to the bank's reliance on attracting high-net-worth customers with competitive loan terms and funding growth through low-cost deposits, which heightened the concentration of uninsured deposits and increased the bank’s sensitivity to interest rate risk. “This strategy ultimately led to a significant asset/liability mismatch for the bank, and fair value declines on its portfolio of low-yielding, long-duration loans, which limited its ability to obtain sufficient liquidity and prevented its recovery,” the review noted. The report proposed 11 recommendations to improve the FDIC's supervision processes including reviewing examination guidance, establishing communication protocols for large banks, updating examination instructions, conducting reviews on contagion risk factors and the supervisory approach to contagion risk, exploring processes for monitoring large bank liquidity risk, adding institutions to the supplemental offsite review list, assessing fair value for long-term loans and engaging with other regulators to evaluate potential changes to regulations under Section 39 of the FDI Act, which empowers the agencies to establish safety and soundness standards. FDIC agreed with all 11 recommendations and will complete the actions by the summer of next year. “The FDIC concurs with this recommendation and will engage with the other regulators to evaluate why the changes to the regulations promulgated under Section 39 of the FDI Act may be warranted to address noncapital triggers to take actions related to unsafe and unsound practices,” the FDIC wrote in its response letter to the report. “The FDIC will document the results of that engagement and evaluation with the other regulators by March 31 2024.”",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/a4/60/bcb6dcda40968268ea57281c66d7/first-republic.jpg,2023-11-30,-0.37,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'WASHINGTON', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 42.75035858154297, 'longitude': -71.83702087402344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Inspector', 'latitude': 15.443519592285156, 'longitude': 120.87570190429688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cotton', 'latitude': 44.699180603027344, 'longitude': -85.05338287353516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 48.64822006225586, 'longitude': -118.73780822753906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Section', 'latitude': 34.57897186279297, 'longitude': -85.98664093017578, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"The FDIC's material-loss review attributed the failure of First Republic Bank to contagion effects from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, a run on deposits, and a business strategy that relied on uninsured deposits and low-cost funding."
UBS Scoops up $2.2-Mln First Republic Broker in New York - AdvisorHub,UBS Scoops up $2.2-Mln First Republic Broker in New York  AdvisorHub,"Mon, 10 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdmlzb3JodWIuY29tL3Vicy1zY29vcHMtdXAtMi0yLW1sbi1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1icm9rZXItaW4tbmV3LXlvcmsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,AdvisorHub,"UBS Wealth Management USA is keeping up the recruiting pressure on First Republic turned-JPMorgan brokers and landed a $2.2 million producer in New York, according to sources familiar with the move. Eugene (Gene) H. Martino, who spent almost a decade at First Republic Bank, joined UBS on Friday. He had been managing around $287 million at First Republic, the source said, and in 2021, he was ranked #232 on Forbes’ best-in-state wealth advisors list. Martino is based out of UBS’s midtown Manhattan office and reports to Neal Cooper, market director at the firm’s Avenue of the Americas office. Martino started his career in 1986 at E.F. Hutton & Co. where he remained through several mergers until joining BNY Mellon in 1996 as a portfolio manager and managing director, according to his BrokerCheck and LinkedIn profiles. He shifted to First Republic in 2011 with the corporate title of wealth manager, according to LinkedIn. A UBS spokesperson confirmed the hire, and a JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment. Martino did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent through social media. Martino’s move to UBS follows two former First Republic brokers who joined the wirehouse last month. Mark W. Alibrandi and Stephen Alibrandi, who call their practice Alibrandi Wealth Management, joined UBS’s Private Wealth Management in Boston on June 22 and had $5.1 million in annual production at First Republic. Also in Boston, UBS picked up a $2.3 million producing broker, Shannon McAllister, who had managed around $450 million in assets at First Republic, on June 15. Both McAllister and the Alibrandi team report to Boston market director Max Bardeem. Since the regional banking crisis started in mid-March, First Republic brokers managing nearly $50 billion in combined client assets have left for other firms, according to an AdvisorHub tally. Including Friday’s move, at least six teams have moved to UBS. First Republic’s wealth business had almost $290 billion in client assets under management prior to its collapse. JPMorgan executives said last month that its purchase of First Republic in May will give its J.P. Morgan Advisors business a substantial boost, although retention offers only apply to those with at least $2.5 million in revenue, sources said previously.",https://www.advisorhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/UBS.jpg,2023-07-10,-0.224,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'LinkedIn', 'description': 'social networking website for people in professional occupations', 'full_name': 'LinkedIn', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Linkedin_screenshot.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'UBS', 'latitude': 47.32661056518555, 'longitude': 8.800040245056152, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'USA', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Eugene', 'latitude': 44.05207061767578, 'longitude': -123.08674621582031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Forbes', 'latitude': 48.616798400878906, 'longitude': -89.65013885498047, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Martino', 'latitude': 54.907779693603516, 'longitude': 67.1963882446289, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Manhattan', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Avenue', 'latitude': 38.25624084472656, 'longitude': -76.76775360107422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Boston', 'latitude': 42.358428955078125, 'longitude': -71.05976867675781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'McAllister', 'latitude': 45.32720184326172, 'longitude': -87.72122192382812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"First Republic Bank has lost several brokers to UBS Wealth Management USA, including Eugene H.

In March, Republic First announced plans to raise $125 million in capital in partnership with an investor group led by Castle Creek Capital, only to see the transaction — announced the same day Silicon Valley Bank failed — come apart in May. The failure prompted sharp criticism from the Norcross-Braca group, which wasn't party to the deal. Additional capital would address a pressing need for Republic First, providing ""greater flexibility to invest in the business and deliver extraordinary service to our loyal customer base and depositors,"" CEO Thomas Geisel said Wednesday in the press release. ""We plan to work with the Norcross-Braca group to put Republic on the best footing possible to enhance value for all shareholders."" Both Republic First and the Norcross-Braca group declined further comment. If the capital raise is successful, the Norcross-Braca group has also agreed to drop all litigation against Republic First and cease proxy solicitation efforts. Last week, Republic First announced a postponement of its annual meeting, which had been scheduled for Oct. 5, until Dec. 19. The Norcross-Braca group had planned to seek three board seats at the annual meeting. In addition to capital, the agreement between Republic First and the Norcross-Braca group includes adding two seats to the company's seven-member board of directors and overhauling its membership. Norcross-Braca would gain the right to appoint two directors. Another two seats would be allocated to third-party investors, while two new independent directors would be selected. Geisel would occupy one of the three remaining board seats, leaving just two for current directors. Neither Republic First nor the Norcross-Braca group have given any indication of who would occupy seats on the reconstituted board. Republic First also agreed to pay the Norcross-Braca group at least $10.5 million, part as a consulting fee and part to reimburse the group for legal, investment banking and other expenses as part of a final arrangement. News of the nonbinding letter of intent came two weeks after the Norcross-Braca group announced it would pause its litigation efforts and offered encouragement to Republic First in its effort to attract new capital. ""We remain actively engaged with the company and other parties on capital raising solutions,"" George Norcross said in a Sept. 11 statement. The lengthy and frequently bitter struggle has contributed to a steep decline in the value of Republic First stock. Shares, which traded at $2.12 at the beginning of 2023, were selling for 19 cents Thursday afternoon.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/d5/dc/3863ef964ddaba685040a308bade/a7bd2e9a-8c2d-460b-b50a-1d2307bde0c9.jpeg,2023-09-28,-0.39,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 41.12166976928711, 'longitude': -83.01750183105469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Norcross', 'latitude': 45.62948989868164, 'longitude': -68.80254364013672, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Camden', 'latitude': 39.92594909667969, 'longitude': -75.11962127685547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Jersey', 'latitude': 40.16706085205078, 'longitude': -74.49987030029297, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Conner', 'latitude': 17.796390533447266, 'longitude': 121.32749938964844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philip', 'latitude': 32.88766860961914, 'longitude': -79.81397247314453, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Castle Creek', 'latitude': 47.002750396728516, 'longitude': -109.34461975097656, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Geisel', 'latitude': 51.340721130371094, 'longitude': 11.979140281677246, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sept', 'latitude': 51.26667022705078, 'longitude': 4.783329963684082, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Republic First Bancorp, a $6 billion-asset company, is raising capital with the help of the Norcross-Braca investor group, who own 10% of its shares.

A federal agency has been auctioning off Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank's wine collections, after seizing control of the failed lenders and their assets this spring. The bottles are far from the strangest assets to end up in government hands as a result of bank collapses. Heritage Auctions shelled out about $150,000 including fees for about 1,900 bottles of wine previously owned by SVB, and close to $20,000 for more than 400 bottles from First Republic's cellar, The Wall Street Journal reported. The auctioneer secured the wines at a roughly 40% discount to their market value, the newspaper said. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantees deposits of up to $250,000 in a single FDIC-insured bank. It covers the cost of providing that protection in part by collecting dues from banks and selling assets it seizes. The FDIC has found itself in possession of many weird and wonderful ""specialty assets"" previously owned by banks. The list includes 25,000 pounds of frozen rabbit, a 12% stake in the Dallas Cowboys in the 1980s, and even a cooler containing a human skull, an agency representative told the Journal. The FDIC also seized company planes, pianos, aquariums, and derelict churches and synagogues. Once it wound up with a coal mine that was apparently on fire the same day its owner shut down, the newspaper reported. ""I guess you could say that the failed-bank side of the FDIC's work reflects the diversity of the banking business, from earth to the heavens above,"" Jay Rosenstein, an agency employee who highlighted the strangest seizures in an internal newsletter, wrote in 2006, per the Journal. The government's haul from First Republic also included a 13-seater corporate jet, and a pair of nine-pound eagle figurines that were handmade in France from Baccarat crystal, according to the report.

Citizens Hires Veteran Morgan Stanley Manager Paul Casey to Lead Wealth Unit - AdvisorHub,Citizens Hires Veteran Morgan Stanley Manager Paul Casey to Lead Wealth Unit  AdvisorHub,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 15:42:33 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdmlzb3JodWIuY29tL2NpdGl6ZW5zLWhpcmVzLXZldGVyYW4tbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXktbWFuYWdlci1wYXVsLWNhc2V5LXRvLWxlYWQtd2VhbHRoLXVuaXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,AdvisorHub,"Paul W. Casey, a veteran manager at Morgan Stanley’s private wealth management unit in New York City, is set to join regional bank Citizens Financial Group as head of wealth management, according to an announcement on Monday. Casey, who led a “flagship” private wealth branch based in Morgan Stanley’s midtown Manhattan headquarters, will start at Citizens on June 9 after serving out his required garden leave notice period, according to the announcement. Casey replaces Christopher Weyrauch, who left Citizens in January, and will report to Brendan Coughlin, head of consumer banking. “His experience in building a world-class Private Wealth business at one of the top firms in the U.S. will be invaluable as we aspire to build a preeminent Private Wealth offering,” Coughlin said in a statement. The Providence, Rhode Island-based bank has been seeking to jumpstart growth at its wealth business, which managed around $22 billion in assets as of last summer. In December, it launched a new private wealth unit with the hire of Thomas B. Metzger, a former Wells Fargo manager and senior recruiter at First Republic Bank. Citizens also announced in February that it had hired Michael Cherny, a former regional manager at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s bank brokerage unit, to lead Citizens Wealth Management Advisors, a group focused on serving mass affluent customers. Both Metzger, who had been with JPMorgan since it purchased First Republic in May 2023, and Cherny will report to Casey. Casey did not return a request for comment sent through LinkedIn. A Morgan Stanley spokesperson declined to comment on his departure or whether it plans to replace him. His former office managed around $90 billion in assets, according to Citizens’ announcement. Casey started his career at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in 2002 in a product development role, according to LinkedIn. He also worked in a strategy role before becoming chief operating officer of the private wealth segment in 2010 and moved into the market executive role overseeing the private wealth office in 2017, according to the job networking site. Overall, Morgan Stanley’s private wealth unit includes around 300 teams who manage $619 billion in assets for ultra-wealthy clients, according to Casey’s former website. Citizens, which bid unsuccessfully on the failed First Republic Bank last year, has since scooped up around 200 of its former relationship managers with connections to its ultra-high net worth clientele. In October, it moved those hires into a new private bank unit that executives have said will provide referrals for Metzger’s private wealth advisors. The private bank is led by Susan deTray who does not report to Casey.",https://www.advisorhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Paul-Casey.jpg,2024-04-15,0.035,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Morgan Stanley', 'description': 'U.S investment bank', 'full_name': 'Morgan Stanley', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Morgan-stanley-building.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase & Co.', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'LinkedIn', 'description': 'social networking website for people in professional occupations', 'full_name': 'LinkedIn', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Linkedin_screenshot.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York City', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Casey', 'latitude': 35.046199798583984, 'longitude': -91.19734954833984, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Manhattan', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Coughlin', 'latitude': 48.883399963378906, 'longitude': -88.38333892822266, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Providence', 'latitude': 41.82398986816406, 'longitude': -71.41282653808594, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Rhode Island', 'latitude': 41.75038146972656, 'longitude': -71.4997787475586, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Metzger', 'latitude': 39.39366912841797, 'longitude': -82.95572662353516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cherny', 'latitude': 61.0644416809082, 'longitude': 33.53627014160156, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Susan', 'latitude': 37.365970611572266, 'longitude': -76.31355285644531, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'eTray', 'latitude': 47.1239013671875, 'longitude': 6.343599796295166, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

What We Learned From Big Bank Earnings on Friday - Investopedia,What We Learned From Big Bank Earnings on Friday  Investopedia,"Sat, 13 Apr 2024 19:16:48 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vd2hhdC13ZS1sZWFybmVkLWZyb20tYmlnLWJhbmstZWFybmluZ3Mtb24tZnJpZGF5LTg2MzA2MzPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Investopedia,"Large U.S. banks kicked off the first-quarter earnings report season by disclosing higher-than-expected profits. But their net interest income—a key performance indicator for the sector—fell shy of projections. Thanks primarily to surging revenue from investment banking and trading activities, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) all surpassed consensus earnings projections from analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. However, net interest income at each declined from the fourth quarter. That's because interest rates that banks charge on loans may have risen with the Fed's rate hikes, but so have the banks' deposit costs—what they pay out on interest-bearing deposits. At JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, net interest income dropped 4% from the previous quarter, falling for the first time in 11 quarters. Net interest income for the first three months of this year also fell 4% at Wells Fargo and 6% at Citigroup compared the prior quarter. Fed's No Longer Feeding Net Interest Income Growth Because of low interest rates, U.S. banks for more than a decade struggled to earn much of a difference between what they charged for loans and paid on deposits. The Fed's interest rate increases to battle inflation in 2022-23 changed that equation, and net interest income rose. Friday's first-quarter data, though, indicate those halcyon days for banks may have ended, even as persistent inflation, emphasized by JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jamie Dimon in his comments accompanying the company's results, has dimmed the prospect of Fed rate cuts this year. Compared with the first quarter of 2023, net interest income increased 11% at JPMorgan, though its purchase of troubled First Republic Bank's assets last year accounted for most of the gain. Net interest income inched 1% higher at Citi compared with the same quarter a year ago but fell 8% at Wells Fargo. Overall, JPMorgan's net income rose 6% compared with a year ago. But profits fell 8% at Wells Fargo and plunged 27% at Citi. Boost from Investment Banking, Trading Nonetheless, revenue and profit rose comfortably at all three banking giants from the fourth quarter. Reflecting the resilience of the U.S. markets and economy, earnings benefited from surging investment banking and trading revenue. In addition, reduced provisions for credit losses signal that U.S. consumers remain in relatively decent financial shape. Investment banking units struggled throughout much of last year amid a dearth of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). But as Moody's noted earlier this week, equity and bond issuance rose markedly in the fourth quarter, fueling a resurgence for large investment banks. The continuing rally in the U.S. stock market provided plentiful opportunities for banks' trading desks, and they took advantage. At Citi, for example, revenue in its Markets division though lower compared with the year-ago quarter, rose 59% from the fourth quarter to almost $5.4 billion, and investment banking and corporate lending revenue surged 68% to $1.8 billion. Combined, those gains accounted for the bulk of the firm's overall revenue increase. Corporate and investment banking revenue increased 24% more than the prior quarter at both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, constituting the bulk of overall revenue gains at those companies, as well. Credit Goes to Consumers Aiding profits for all three banks during the quarter: A decline in the amount of money they set aside for potential loan losses. Concerns have increased that consumers have run out of cash as credit card balances rise. That also has heightened worries that loan defaults will increase. But it's not a concern the big banks imparted in their first-quarter results. All three banks reduced their provisions for credit losses considerably in the first quarter on a sequential basis. One potential sign that consumers might have started pulling back, appeared, though. Loan balances for all three banks fell slightly during the quarter as interest rates remain high. If that continues, banks may have to reduce loan rates to drum up demand. That, in turn, would place further downward pressure on net interest income.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/1Kj8bWOBfFOCmmqZfzkHjpIscwc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1328719211-a49a29a8ee0447e893396af468166055.jpg,2024-04-13,-0.259,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Citigroup', 'description': 'American investment bank and financial services corporation', 'full_name': 'Citigroup', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/388_Greenwich_Street_from_Battery_Park_City_North_Esplanade.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Citi', 'latitude': -18.14944076538086, 'longitude': 34.828330993652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Moody', 'latitude': 33.590938568115234, 'longitude': -86.4908218383789, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.
US regional bank shares rally after Western Alliance reports deposit growth - Yahoo Canada Shine On,US regional bank shares rally after Western Alliance reports deposit growth  Yahoo Canada Shine On,"Sun, 14 Apr 2024 13:03:34 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL3VzLXJlZ2lvbmFsLWJhbmstc2hhcmVzLWp1bXAtMTA0NjM5ODc4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Canada Shine On,"By Niket Nishant and Chibuike Oguh (Reuters) -Shares of U.S. regional lenders jumped on Wednesday on growing investor confidence that the worst of the banking crisis was likely over, following news of strong deposit growth at Western Alliance Bancorp. Deposits at Western Alliance grew by more than $2 billion in the three months to May 12, the bank said on Tuesday, suggesting customers remained confident of its financial health after three regional lenders failed in recent months: Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said Western Alliance's deposit growth disclosure was good news for worried investors. ""Western Alliance, one of the most hard-hit banks, came out with a filing showing deposit increase. And as these banks start to show that deposits have stabilized, more confidence is built back into the space in general,"" Hogan said. Western Alliance shares, which are down 41% year-to-date, surged 10% to $34.81, erasing losses recorded over the last two weeks. Other regional lenders closed higher: PacWest Bancorp, whose stock has lost nearly 76% of its value year-to-date, spiked 22%. Comerica Inc gained 12.3%, Zions Bancorp added 12%, KeyCorp rose 8.6%. The KBW Regional Banking Index rose 7.3%, jumping to its highest level since May 1. ""We're not going to make it back to pre-crisis levels anytime soon because we do know that the earnings environment for regional banks will still be impaired, but the period of emergency seems to be dissipating and there's more focusing on the fundamentals,"" Hogan added. Regulators need to work together with the regional banking industry to find policy options that will help bring back consumer confidence and stability to the financial system, said Lindsay Johnson, president and chief executive of retail banking lobby group Consumer Bankers Association, in a speech at the Exchequer Club of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. ""We call on policymakers to join our industry in helping to reinstall consumers' confidence in our financial system and stability across the marketplace,"" Johnson said. Regional banks, the largest lenders to the beleaguered U.S. commercial real estate and construction markets, have reduced their exposure to the sector by tightening standards and making fewer loans, according to a Reuters analysis. Many real estate borrowers face challenges making interest payments in a rising rate environment, while office use declined during the pandemic and property values have decreased on recession concerns. Deposit flows at U.S. banks, including regional lenders, climbed to $17.16 trillion in the week ended May 3, marking the first increase in four weeks, according to Federal Reserve data. First Republic Bank's former Chief Executive Michael Roffler blamed the bank's collapse on contagion from the failures of other regional banks and said regulators did not express concerns regarding the bank's strategy, liquidity or management performance. A total of over $100 billion in deposits were withdrawn from the bank in recent weeks, a time of industry-wide panic about soundness of regional banks, Roffler said in prepared testimony to be delivered at a U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services sub-committee hearing.

Downtown Fort Worth Office Vacancy is 11.5% - The Real Deal,Downtown Fort Worth Office Vacancy is 11.5%  The Real Deal,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 21:26:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL3RleGFzL2RhbGxhcy8yMDI0LzA0LzE1L2Rvd250b3duLWZvcnQtd29ydGgtb2ZmaWNlLXZhY2FuY3ktaXMtMTEtNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Real Deal,"It’s going to be an exciting year for JLL’s Geoff Shelton. He’s responsible for leasing up one of Fort Worth’s rarest resources: new Class A office space. The firm has been tapped by Nebraska-based developer Goldenrod Companies, which is putting its stamp on Fort Worth in the form of two mixed-use projects in the city’s Cultural District. Between One University and the Van Zandt, Goldenrod is expected to add 218,000 square feet of office space to the market by the end of 2026. Since companies have struggled to make working in the office more appealing than working from home, the latest office movement trend is “flight to quality.” But in Fort Worth, that means “a very focused flight to neighborhood … where tenants have gravitated toward certain neighborhoods that have these quality new assets,” Shelton said. Not only are tenants seeking out premium office space; they’re also looking to be surrounded by amenities, like restaurants and luxury hotels. Right now, those hot neighborhoods are: West Bend, Clearfork and the Cultural District. In less than a decade, more than a billion dollars has been invested in the area just west of downtown Fort Worth that includes Dickies arena, the city’s museums and nightlife destinations. In 2023, Dallas-based Crescent Real Estate opened a $275 million mixed-use development whose offices are already mostly leased. Next door, luxury hotel brand Auberge Resorts Collection opened the Bowie House hotel in December. “It’s kind of our Uptown Dallas,” Shelton said. Healthy fundamentals Amid warning cries of the office apocalypse, Fort Worth’s market is writing a different narrative. Downtowns across the country are grappling with high office vacancy, but that’s not the case for Fort Worth’s central business district. It has a vacancy rate of just 11.5 percent, Partners’ Steve Triolet said. Thirty miles away on Interstate 30, downtown Dallas’ vacancy rate is 26.4 percent. Plus, the sublease market makes up just half of a percent of the vacancy in Fort Worth’s CBD. Fort Worth is also seeing rent increases. The city’s central business district saw a 10 percent jump in rents between the first quarter of this year and the first quarter of last year. Triolet attributes that in part to the fact that downtown property is largely owned by a few entities, like the billionaire Bass family. Less competition gives landlords a bit more control. If all goes according to plan, the forthcoming Goldenrod properties will help prop up the city’s rent numbers. Goldenrod is expecting to lease space at Van Zandt at $48 per square foot triple-net, and $52 per square foot at One University, Shelton said. The two sides of low inventory When companies relocate to Dallas-Fort Worth, more often than not, they’re looking for new product or offices built to suit. The Goldenrod projects will certainly make a splash, but they’re pretty much on their own when it comes to new upscale office space in Fort Worth. “There’s really not much coming in the grand scheme,” Triolet said. For its strong fundamentals, downtown Fort Worth’s absorption is “kind of quiet,” he said. In the first quarter of this year, the city’s CBD saw 1,000 square feet of positive absorption, which Triolet called “basically a rounding error.” That’s why Shelton doesn’t think that these two developments will be just flash-in-the-pan successes. Take the Stack over in Dallas’ Deep Ellum neighborhood. That highly anticipated project from Hines, Westdale Real Estate Investments and Management, and Ivanhoe Cambridge was fully leased one year after delivery; now, more than a third of the building is on the sublease market. To Shelton, Fort Worth’s low inventory makes this kind of outcome unlikely. “We’re essentially starting with a blank canvas of new delivery,” he said. Betting on Fort Worth Goldenrod isn’t the only developer betting on demand for premium office space in Fort Worth.

S&P 500 slumps as SVB Financial shutdown stokes bank contagion fears - Yahoo Movies UK,S&P 500 slumps as SVB Financial shutdown stokes bank contagion fears  Yahoo Movies UK,"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 19:14:35 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvcC01MDAtc2x1bXBzLXN2Yi1maW5hbmNpYWwtMTQyNjQ0MDkwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Movies UK,"By Yasin Ebrahim Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slumped Friday, amid fears of contagion that swept through banking stocks as regulators closed SVB Financial to protect deposits after the beleaguered bank's effort to secure funding failed. The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%, or 333 points, the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.8%. SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) was closed by regulators and its deposits placed under control of regulators to protect depositors. The news sparked widespread fears of a spillover into the broader banking sector, with regional banks, which tend to have less diversified funding sources than their larger peers, in the firing line. Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) and First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) were down more than 18%, while JPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo &Company (NYSE:WFC) were in the green amid expectations that depositors will seek safety in larger banks. The turmoil in banks triggering worries about a systematic banking crisis forced investors to rethink their bets on larger rate hikes at the Federal Reserve’s March meeting even as job gains in February topped estimates. The U.S. economy created 311,000 jobs last month, well above expectations, though there were some signs of softening in the labor market including a tick up in the unemployment rate and slower wage growth. “It is hard to say that cracks are forming in the labor market when payrolls increase 311k, but it seems like we are at least at the ""beginning of the beginning"" of the process of seeing the labor market soften,” Jefferies said in a note. Investors reined in the bets on a 50 basis points rate hike in March to 50% from about 80% a day earlier, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Treasury yields, which had jumped to their highest level in more than a decade earlier this week, fell sharply, helping the broader market pare some losses. On the earnings front, DocuSign's (NASDAQ:DOCU) better-than-expected quarterly results were overshadowed by an announcement that its chief financial officer Cynthia Gaylor would step down later this year. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), meanwhile, reported mixed fourth-quarter results as revenue missed Wall Street expectations, sending the stock more than 3% lower. Following the results, Goldman Sachs reiterated its sell rating on Oracle amid worries about market share losses in the database market, expectations for a slowdown in subscription services revenue and the impact of capital expenditure pressure on margins. Elsewhere Gap (NYSE:GPS) reported a wider quarterly loss and guidance which fell short of Wall Street estimates. Credit Suisse described the guidance from the retailer as “sobering,” but said there was “less risk of further downward revisions beyond the initial guidance.” Related Articles",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,2023-03-10,-0.112,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'DocuSign', 'description': 'United States company', 'full_name': 'DocuSign', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/DocuSignHeadquarters.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NYSE', 'latitude': 1.065369963645935, 'longitude': 13.047080039978027, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Company', 'latitude': 5.2648701667785645, 'longitude': 10.22821044921875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wall Street', 'latitude': 37.61832046508789, 'longitude': -112.16436004638672, 'location_type': 'UNDETERMINED'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Oracle', 'latitude': 32.61090850830078, 'longitude': -110.77092742919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Suisse', 'latitude': 47.000160217285156, 'longitude': 8.014269828796387, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.
Pakistan Court Stays Arrest Warrant Against Ex-PM Imran Khan - Yahoo Movies UK,Pakistan Court Stays Arrest Warrant Against Ex-PM Imran Khan  Yahoo Movies UK,"Sun, 14 Apr 2024 10:34:21 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvcGFraXN0YW4tY291cnQtYWdhaW4taGFsdHMtcG9saWNlLTA4MzM1OTA3OS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Movies UK,"(Bloomberg) -- A Pakistan court has dismissed the petition of former Prime Minister Imran Khan seeking suspension of his arrest warrant, after violent clashes near his home this week prevented security officials from detaining him. Most Read from Bloomberg “The judgment means Khan can be arrested now,” his lawyer, Sher Afzal Marwat, told reporters outside a district court in Islamabad. The court rejected Khan’s petition on the grounds that it was “not justified by law as well as fact.” Thursday’s development comes hours after the Lahore High Court suspended any further police action against Khan until Friday. The former cricket star is facing multiple court cases, which he says are politically motivated and designed to keep him out of elections later this year. Khan plans to challenge the verdict in a higher court, his aide, Shibli Faraz, said. The former prime minister has told the court he will appear on March 18. For two days, security forces and Khan’s supporters have clashed near his home in the city of Lahore. Police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse crowds trying to block the former prime minister’s arrest. The street battles and legal tussles to bring Khan to court have threatened to overshadow the country’s economic crisis. Pakistan’s dollar bonds due 2024 were indicated inching 0.1 cents higher to 42.1 cents on the dollar, after tumbling by the most since September on Wednesday. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has denied that the court cases are related to elections, saying his focus is on securing loans from the International Monetary Fund to help Pakistan avoid a default. While speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he dismissed any suggestion that political friction is causing delays in reviving the bailout program. “We have accepted all the conditions - very tough conditions set by the IMF,” Sharif said when asked about the delay in the deal. “I hope the staff level agreement will be signed very soon and it will be sent to the IMF board.” Sharif has rejected Khan’s demands to hold snap polls and has said elections will be held from September and October onwards as he wants to focus on the economy first. Khan has said the court cases filed against him are a move to silence him and break his popularity. The latest arrest warrant, issued last week, is in relation to allegations that Khan failed to disclose funds obtained from the sale of state gifts when he was in power. Khan has denied wrongdoing. Most Popular Despite the dozens of court cases leveled against Khan, he remains the most popular politician in Pakistan, according to an opinion survey published last week. His rallies draw tens of thousands of people at any one time, but Khan has said he faces threats to his life and the court cases expose him further. Khan has been largely confined to his home in Lahore since he was shot and wounded in the leg during a rally in November. He has asked that all the court hearings be carried out in a high-security judicial complex in Islamabad. Prime Minister Sharif has become deeply unpopular among voters, who blame his coalition for the nation’s economic crisis. The Pakistani rupee has plummeted to new lows and inflation is hovering at a record high. His government has been forced to raise energy prices and taxes as it races to meet conditions to revive a loan with the IMF. They need to avoid a default that can make borrowing costs higher and cut off market access to credit. --With assistance from Ismail Dilawar and Khalid Qayum.

Bay Area Landlords Sue FDIC Over First Republic Bank Leases - The Real Deal,Bay Area Landlords Sue FDIC Over First Republic Bank Leases  The Real Deal,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 21:07:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby8yMDI0LzA0LzE1L2JheS1hcmVhLWxhbmRsb3Jkcy1zdWUtZmRpYy1vdmVyLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLWJhbmstbGVhc2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Real Deal,"Bay Area office landlords have filed separate lawsuits against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, accusing the agency of giving lowball offers to settle unpaid rent claims against shuttered lender First Republic Bank. The three lawsuits, which involve rejected First Republic leases in Walnut Creek, Noe Valley and Greenbrae, outline claims of $48.3 million in unpaid rent. Out of that total, the FDIC only approved payouts totaling nearly $1.5 million. The FDIC was appointed as the receiver of the failed bank in May 2023. The closure was the second-largest bank collapse in the history of the United States, behind the failure of Washington Mutual in 2008. J.P. Morgan acquired First Republic Bank through an auction in April last year. The biggest claim relates to California Plaza, a 10-story office building in Walnut Creek. First Republic signed an 88,000-square-foot lease at the property, located at 2121 North California Boulevard, in March 2022, court records show. That transaction was one of the largest lease deals in Walnut Creek for the second quarter of 2022, according to a report from Colliers. In its complaint, the owner of California Plaza, an entity managed by commercial brokerage Newmark Knight Frank, claims that the FDIC took more than seven months to repudiate the lease. The plaintiff claims that this “unreasonable delay” led to “lost opportunities to lease the premises to other tenants.” In September, Newmark submitted a claim of $47 million. It also claimed that “at a minimum,” it is entitled to $3.9 million in unpaid rent dating to when the lease was repudiated in December 2023. In response, the FDIC approved a $1.4 million payment, or 3 percent of the claim. According to the complaint, the FDIC stopped paying rent in August 2023 and First Republic has yet to vacate the property. One of the other cases against the FDIC relates to 505 Sir Francis Drake Boulevard in Greenbrae, a low-slung standalone office buildling. An entity managed by investor Soheyla Hifai claims she is owed $1.3 million. The FDIC only allowed a $23,000 portion of her claim. Meanwhile, Noe Valley LLC, which owns 3936 and 3938 24th Street in Noe Valley, said that it is owed $500,000 in unpaid rent and construction costs for the retail location. The FDIC approved a payment of $6,239. First Republic Bank will cease to exist on May 24, with its remaining 62 branches across the country set to close. The closures will include 25 locations in the Bay Area. The FDIC declined to comment.",https://static.therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SFO-FDIC-sued-over-rejected-First-Republic-Bank-leases-in-SF-FEATUREIMG_v2.jpg,2024-04-15,-0.571,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Washington Mutual', 'description': 'former American bank holding company', 'full_name': 'Washington Mutual', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Washington_Mutual_Tower%2C_Seattle%2C_August_2006.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'J.P.

The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had sparked a crisis of confidence in the banking sector, leading to a run on deposits at a host of regional banks despite U.S. authorities launching emergency measures to shore up confidence. Earlier on Tuesday, S&P Global Ratings placed First Republic Bank on CreditWatch negative, reflecting lower confidence in the lender's financial strength. However, later in the day, S&P said it had not seen evidence that the unmanageable deposit outflows seen at a few banks had widely spread across the banks it covers. S&P said U.S. regulators' measures gave banks additional liquidity, although the ratings agency cautioned that conditions were fluid and that some banks were showing greater signs of stress than others. Moody's Investors Service revised its outlook on the U.S. banking system to ""negative"" from ""stable"" earlier on Tuesday to reflect the rapid deterioration in the operating environment. However, Ron O'Hanley, the chief executive officer of asset manager State Street Corp, said on Wednesday that Moody's outlook cut was ""a terrible overreaction."" The regulators had reassured markets, O'Hanley said in a Bloomberg News interview.

Grace period: After the CD matures, First Republic Bank will automatically roll your funds into a new CD. But you’ll have 10 days to make a penalty-free withdrawal of the funds. The standout detail of First Republic Bank’s CDs is the minimum opening deposit requirement. You’ll need at least $10,000 to open a CD with this bank, which is a hefty requirement. Many banks don’t require an opening deposit close to this large. How Much You Can Earn As you explore your CD options with First Republic and other financial institutions, it’s helpful to see how much you can earn through a CD term. The amount you can earn varies based on the CD term you choose, the APY you snag, and the amount of money you lock into the CD. The table below highlights what you could earn through First Republic’s CDs with various deposit amounts. How To Open a First Republic Bank CD If you want to open a CD with First Republic Bank, you can do so by calling the bank or visiting a physical branch. The bank has locations in California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. You can also fill out an online form with your contact information and request for the bank to contact you. How First Republic Bank CDs Compare When it comes to opening a CD, annual percentage yields should play a big role in your decision-making process. A higher APY means you’ll have the opportunity to earn more interest from that CD than one with a lower APY. Of course, most savers want to get the most bang for their buck, which means locking in a CD with a top rate. Overall, First Republic Bank’s CD rates are less than competitive with top options. While the bank offers a few standout rates, like the 4.75% APY for a nine-month term, that’s not enough to make all of First Republic Bank’s CD offerings competitive. Not surprisingly, online banks tend to offer the highest APYs for CDs. Since online banks have more limited expenses than banks with brick-and-mortar locations, online banks are usually able to offer more value to savers. If you want to lock in a top CD rate for your savings, check out GOBankingRates’ list of top CD options today. You might be surprised by how much you can earn on your savings. Takeaway First Republic Bank offers a wide range of CD terms. But savers can find higher CD rates elsewhere. Sarah Sharkey contributed to the reporting for this article.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 ended 1% lower, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 lost 1.5%. British banks fell 2.6%, with major lenders including Barclays, HSBC holdings and Standard Chartered down between 1.9% and 2.8%. Banking crisis fears persisted even after major U.S. banks on Thursday offered a $30 billion lifeline for beleaguered First Republic Bank, while Credit Suisse also received an emergency liquidity line from the Swiss central bank. ""The market has been flip-flopping over these bank stories about whether there can be risk of contagion from SVB or Credit Suisse,"" said Giles Coghlan, chief market analyst at HYCM. ""They (markets) are still concerned that there's going to be further defaults from some other unknown source."" The internationally-focussed FTSE 100 posted its worst weekly performance of down 5.3% in a year as fears of a global banking crisis rattled markets, following the collapse of two U.S. lenders, with troubles at Swiss lender Credit Suisse only compounding concerns. The only bright sport on the index were precious metal miners, up 1.8% tracking the raise in gold prices, with the yellow-metal being a safe-haven investment. Investor focus now shifts to interest rate decisions from the Bank of England (BoE) and Federal Reserve next week, in light of the European Central Bank raising its interest rate by a hefty 50-basis points on Thursday. Money markets see a 56% chance that the BoE will leave its interest rates unchanged, while the rest see the probability of a 25-basis-point hike. Among single stocks, Bodycote jumped 5.8% after the thermal processing service provider reported higher full-year revenue. British telecom firm BT Group lost 6.1% after the UK's telecoms regulator Ofcom said it would need more time to consider BT's wholesale pricing.

New details on rush of Home Loan bank borrowings at three failed banks - American Banker,New details on rush of Home Loan bank borrowings at three failed banks  American Banker,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 20:36:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ldy1kZXRhaWxzLW9uLXJ1c2gtb2YtaG9tZS1sb2FuLWJhbmstYm9ycm93aW5ncy1hdC10aHJlZS1mYWlsZWQtYmFua3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,American Banker,"Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank increased their outstanding borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank System by more than a third each shortly before failing, according to the Government Accountability Office. The increase in borrowings is the subject of a 27-page GAO report issued last week that examines the role of the Federal Home Loan banks in providing liquidity to their members during the banking crisis in the spring of 2023. The report provides a granular take on where money was going to the failed banks in the ninth inning of their existence as each sought to stem massive outflows from depositors. The GAO found that the three banks borrowed substantially more from the Home Loan Bank System than a group of their peers that included 16 commercial banks. The report is the first in a series in which the GAO will look at broader issues related to the Home Loan Bank System. The private network of 11 regional, cooperative banks was created in 1932 after the Great Depression to serve as a source of funding for thrifts originating mortgages. The report was requested by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., and the panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters of California. ""GAO found the FHLBs of New York and San Francisco provided significant levels of advances to these banks compared to others, and that Signature Bank used FHLB advances to offset liquidity gaps it experienced related to crypto-related deposits,"" Waters said last week in a press release. ""Meanwhile, SVB was unable to reposition collateral quickly enough from its FHLB to the Fed's discount window to access emergency liquidity."" Starting on March 1, 2023, SVB increased its borrowings by 50% to $30 billion and then failed a week later. Signature's borrowings rose 37% to $11.2 billion in the first two weeks of March before it failed that same month. And First Republic's borrowings jumped 45% to $28.1 billion in the first two weeks of March before it failed in May, the GAO report found. The GAO looked at the communication and coordination of the Home Loan banks with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Reserve System — the failed banks' primary federal regulators — and the repayment of the failed banks' outstanding loans, known as advances, to the system. ""One of the main areas of focus is: Are the Federal Home Loan banks managing their relationships and their counterparty risk with institutions as they begin to fail, and do they have the right agreements and oversight in place with the Fed and others?"" said Jim Parrott, co-owner of Parrott Ryan Advisors and a nonresident fellow at the Urban Institute. ""When everything's going 90 miles an hour, as an institution begins to take on water, are all of the relevant regulators and others who are in some sense indirectly responsible for taxpayer risks … coordinating?"" The GAO said that SVB failed before the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco was able to request additional supervisory information from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The New York and San Francisco Home Loan banks both were able to communicate with the FDIC about Signature and First Republic as those banks were declining, the GAO said. ""It was striking to me that [the Home Loan banks] kept lending to these failing banks until the very last week or days before they failed,"" said Sharon Cornelissen, director of housing at the Consumer Federation of America and chair of the Coalition for FHLB Reform. ""Only because the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco does not lend over the weekend, SVB was frantically trying to gain access to the [Fed's] discount window at the very last moment."" The report was released several months after the Federal Housing Finance Agency's review of the system. FHFA, the system's regulator, released a 100-year review of the Home Loan banks in November that included 50 recommendations for reforms. Waters said she is working on legislation to implement many of the FHFA's recommendations, including doubling the system's contributions to affordable housing to 20% from the current congressionally-mandated 10%. She also is exploring ways to improve access and functioning of the Fed's discount window. Teresa Bazemore, president and CEO of the San Francisco Home Loan Bank, said in an interview last week that it is important to understand what was happening ahead of the March 2023 liquidity crisis. Banks and credit unions were flush with record levels of deposits in 2021 from government stimulus programs in response to the pandemic. At that time, the Home Loan banks' core business of providing liquidity to members had dried up. But in 2022, money market mutual funds started offering depositors higher rates, putting many banks in a squeeze. ""Some of the money started to outflow from [member] banks at the same time those institutions had already invested some of that money. They'd already loaned it out, they'd already made mortgage loans [and] put them in their portfolios. They bought securities,"" Bazemore said. ""So if you compare where things were at the end of 2021 to the end of 2022, you saw our advances go up as a system because of that transfer of deposits out of the banks and credit unions. And that's really what the system was set up for."" The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates 11 times between 2022 and 2023 in an attempt to curb inflation. As a result, many banks were ""upside down"" and needed to borrow from the Home Loan Bank System, or alternatively, had to bring in brokered deposits, Bazemore said. Brokered deposits are typically made by companies with the assistance of a third party. ""If you've got a portfolio of 3% mortgage loans, where are you going to get the income to pay 4% or 5%, to compete with the money market [funds]?"" Bazemore asked. The GAO report also looked at the repayment of advances by the failed banks and whether there was a cost to the federal Deposit Insurance Fund. After regulators took aggressive steps last year to protect uninsured depositors, particularly venture capitalists after the failure of SVB, the FDIC assessed a special fee on more than 100 banks to replenish the fund, known in bank parlance as the ""DIF."" The GAO report said that repayment ""does not impose a direct cost'' but that ""research findings vary"" regarding the risks that failed banks' advances from the system pose to the DIF. Home Loan banks have a priority position ahead of the FDIC when a bank goes into receivership, an issue that has become a bone of contention among critics of the system. The GAO said that in 2000 and 2005, respectively, studies by the Fed and FDIC noted that ""FHLBanks' priority position in receivership could subsidize member bank risk-taking, which could imply greater losses for the Deposit Insurance Fund."" The GAO also said that a 2023 FHFA review of academic literature found that Home Loan banks' regulatory policies and practices mitigate moral-hazard concerns, while a study by the Urban Institute last year found that an increase in a commercial bank's use of advances reduces the odds of failure, particularly for a smaller bank. Still, the report noted that ""if proceeds of the failed bank's liquidated assets do not cover claims eligible for the fund after repayment of FHLBank advances and any other secured claims, the Deposit Insurance Fund would incur costs.'' The GAO report also detailed the fees charged by both the San Francisco and New York Home Loan banks, which varied dramatically. Bank failures may trigger prepayment fees that the Home Loan banks charge, which are required by the FHFA for certain products. Waiver fees also may be charged if a member-bank makes voluntary prepayments. The Home Loan banks also may waive the fees, or even charge the FDIC, as the receiver of a failed bank, a waiver fee to compensate for risks. Prepayment penalties also vary depending on the length and terms of an advance. The FDIC typically pays off advances and incurs a fee in order to take the collateral that has been pledged by a commercial bank to a Home Loan bank. After SVB failed, the FDIC transferred all its deposits and nearly all of its assets to Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, which repaid the $30 billion in outstanding advances to the San Francisco Home Loan Bank. The San Francisco bank received $266.5 million in prepayment fees and $18.8 million in waiver fees. Most of SVB's advances had terms of one to three years. ""SVB did not have a particular stated strategy for borrowing advances in that maturity range,"" the GAO said, citing officials from the San Francisco Home Loan Bank. Meanwhile First Republic's outstanding advances were assumed by JPMorgan Chase, which repaid roughly $5.8 billion in loans that had reached maturity, and has indicated that it plans to repay the remaining advances according to the advance terms. In contrast, after Signature Bank failed, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York also received full repayment for Signature's $11.2 billion in outstanding advances but received just $260,000 in prepayment fees and no waiver fees. ""The broader discussion is whether this is the role that we want [the FHLBs] to play,"" Cornelissen said. ""According to the law they were within their rights to provide liquidity, but we should be more tightly regulating them because it's not their place to be the lender of last resort. They are going to keep lending until the very last day because that's their business model and presents no risk to them."" Ryan Donovan, president and CEO of the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, the system's trade group, applauded the GAO report for finding that the system made efforts to coordinate with the Federal Reserve banks of New York and San Francisco in accordance with policies and procedures. ""We appreciate the findings in the GAO's report, and we believe they validate what we have been saying for a year: that the FHLBanks acted as a critical shock absorber for the financial system during a period of unprecedented turbulence in the spring of 2023,"" Donovan said. ""The two most important takeaways from this report are that the FHLBanks provided crucial liquidity to their members in direct accordance with the structure and role laid out for them by Congress, and that the FHLBanks worked tirelessly in a coordinated fashion with primary financial regulators to ensure the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system."" The Federal Home Loan Bank System reported earnings of $6.7 billion at year-end, an 111% jump from a year earlier. The system also paid out a record $3.4 billion in dividends to its members, more than double the $1.4 billion paid in 2022. The GAO report is dated March 8 but was released on April 8 after lawmakers and the Home Loan banks had a month to assess its findings.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/20/2d/d39f5c04427a8cec17146f1e677a/linkedin-post-2023-06-22t153459-704.jpg,2024-04-16,-0.024,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'GAO', 'latitude': 14.376899719238281, 'longitude': 9.014699935913086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'House', 'latitude': 34.646728515625, 'longitude': -103.90441131591797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Committee', 'latitude': -33.15781021118164, 'longitude': 26.832590103149414, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'N.C.', 'latitude': 35.50069046020508, 'longitude': -80.00032043457031, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Democrat', 'latitude': 43.09627151489258, 'longitude': -116.77539825439453, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'York', 'latitude': 44.0513916015625, 'longitude': -79.48027801513672, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Institute', 'latitude': 44.89332962036133, 'longitude': -87.28704071044922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Federation', 'latitude': -28.83146095275879, 'longitude': 121.7739028930664, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bazemore', 'latitude': 33.89455032348633, 'longitude': -87.70001983642578, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DIF', 'latitude': 0.9915599822998047, 'longitude': 40.9551887512207, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Valley', 'latitude': 46.066810607910156, 'longitude': -62.7819709777832, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Council', 'latitude': 44.729888916015625, 'longitude': -116.43820190429688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Donovan', 'latitude': 40.883331298828125, 'longitude': -87.6161117553711, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Congress', 'latitude': 40.9258918762207, 'longitude': -82.05293273925781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not directly related,First Republic Bank increased its borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank System by 45% to $28.1 billion in the first two weeks of March 2023 before it failed in May.

Citigroup Inc. expects to contribute as much as $1.5 billion to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s pot that was depleted to protect deposits at the two failed lenders, making it the last of the country’s biggest banks to disclose the set-asides. In total, the six largest lenders forecast covering 56% of the $15.8 billion it cost the FDIC to protect uninsured depositors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. expects to pay the largest fee, at approximately $3 billion, while Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. will each pay almost $2 billion. The Deposit Insurance Fund typically covers only $250,000 in an individual bank account, but after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature fell into receivership in March, the FDIC, Federal Reserve and Treasury Department, perceiving a potential threat to the financial system, announced systemic risk exceptions for the two banks. That meant all depositors at the institutions would be made whole to prevent further destabilization.

It’s usually filled and refilled by all insured banks kicking in quarterly fees knows as assessments, but when the government decided to cover uninsured deposits as well, it said that any losses to the fund would be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law. In May, the FDIC released a proposed rule outlining how the special assessments might be collected. The plan, which bases each institution’s fee on its estimated uninsured deposits as of December, excluding the first $5 billion, may be tweaked based on public comments, but, as it stands, big banks are on the hook. The agency said institutions with more than $50 billion in assets would pay 95% of the fees, and those with less than $5 billion wouldn’t have to pay at all. A week and a half before the proposal was released, First Republic Bank also failed, making an additional $13 billion dent in the Deposit Insurance Fund, the FDIC estimated at the time. But there won’t be a separate special assessment levied for First Republic, because the bank was quickly purchased by JPMorgan and a systemic risk exception wasn’t deemed necessary. --With assistance from Hannah Levitt. ©2023 Bloomberg L.P.",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1955232!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.png,2023-08-04,-0.709,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Citigroup Inc.', 'description': 'American investment bank and financial services corporation', 'full_name': 'Citigroup', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/388_Greenwich_Street_from_Battery_Park_City_North_Esplanade.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase & Co.', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Extra', 'latitude': 38.6173095703125, 'longitude': -81.85151672363281, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

Banks rushed to borrow unprecedented amounts from the Federal Reserve as the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank rattled Wall Street. Lenders snapped up $153 billion from the Fed's discount window – the traditional backstop for banks – in the week ended March 15, according to new data. That blows away the historic high of $111 billion reached during the 2008 financial crisis. The data also showed banks borrowed $11.9 billion from the Fed's new emergency loan tool dubbed the Bank Term Funding Program, launched after Silicon Valley's eye-popping downfall. Top economist Mohamed El-Erian reflected on the data, adding the underlying motive driving this behaviour among the banks is not yet clear. ""The names of the borrowing institutions will be available in a couple of years. What we don't know today and that matters for assessing systemic risk: How much of this record amount reflects Urgent needs, Precautionary behavior, Exploiting an attractive price arbitrage,"" he said in a tweet. The global banking system has come under pressure in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's demise. On Thursday, a group of 11 banks led by Wall Street beasts including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo agreed to deposit $30 billion into the troubled First Republic Bank. The move followed a turbulent few days for the regional lender as fears of depositors pulling funds sparked a selloff in its share price following SVB's implosion. Silicon Valley Bank was taken over by US regulators last week after clients yanked funds in learning about a multi-billion-dollar loss on SVB's bond portfolio. ""This data will be parsed more in coming weeks if stress persists but the 11 bank consortium into First Republic will be hoped to be enough to prevent that,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said Friday, referring to the latest bank borrowings from the Fed.

Brent crude futures settled down by $1.73, or 2.3%, to $72.97 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.61, or 2.4%, at $66.74. At their session low, both benchmarks were down more than $3. Brent fell nearly by 12% in the week, its biggest weekly fall since December. WTI futures fell 13% since Friday's close, its biggest since last April. ""The underlying fundamentals aren't as terrible as what is being priced in here, but there is concern the oil is not as safe a place as cash or gold,"" said John Kilduff, Partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. Oil prices tracked equity markets lower, dogged by the banking sector crisis and worries about possible recession. All three indexes were sharply lower in afternoon trading, with financial stocks down the most among the major sectors of the S&P 500 following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank and with trouble at Credit Suisse and First Republic Bank. Prices had recovered some ground after support measures from the European Central Bank and U.S. lenders, but dropped again when SVB Financial Group said it had filed for reorganization. Pressure stemmed from ""the continued fragile state of the market"", said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. Analysts still expect constrained global supply to support oil prices in the foreseeable future. OPEC+ members attributed this week's price weakness to financial drivers rather than any supply and demand imbalance, adding that they expected the market to stabilise. WTI's fall this week to less than $70 a barrel for the first time since December 2021 could spur the U.S. government to start refilling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, boosting demand. And analysts expect China's demand recovery to add price support, with U.S. crude exports to China in March heading towards their highest in nearly two and a half years. Saudi Arabia and Russia in a meeting on Thursday affirmed their commitment to OPEC+'s decision last October to cut production targets by two million barrels per day until the end of 2023. An OPEC+ monitoring panel is due to meet on Apr. 3.

The payment of more interest on deposits hurts the bottom line of large US banks - EL PAÍS USA,The payment of more interest on deposits hurts the bottom line of large US banks  EL PAÍS USA,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 09:57:28 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9lY29ub215LWFuZC1idXNpbmVzcy8yMDI0LTA0LTE3L3RoZS1wYXltZW50LW9mLW1vcmUtaW50ZXJlc3Qtb24tZGVwb3NpdHMtaHVydHMtdGhlLWJvdHRvbS1saW5lLW9mLWxhcmdlLXVzLWJhbmtzLmh0bWzSAZ8BaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vZWNvbm9teS1hbmQtYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyNC0wNC0xNy90aGUtcGF5bWVudC1vZi1tb3JlLWludGVyZXN0LW9uLWRlcG9zaXRzLWh1cnRzLXRoZS1ib3R0b20tbGluZS1vZi1sYXJnZS11cy1iYW5rcy5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,EL PAÍS USA,"Wall Street’s large banks are feeling the effects of the sharp rise in interest rates at two different speeds. On one hand, they hastily passed on the hikes on their loans, but they dragged their feet when it came to deposits and other interest-paying products. Now, expenses derived from high interest expenses are skyrocketing and affecting first quarter earnings results. Large banks have not particularly suffered from the rise in commercial real estate delinquencies, which puts more pressure on regional banks. Instead, they have had to make new contributions to the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) to finance the bailouts of Silicon Valley Bank and the rest of the mid-sized banks that failed last year. Meanwhile, investment banking commissions are recovering in the heat of the resurgence of IPOs, bond placements and corporate operations. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo made profits of $34.4 billion in the first three months of this year, 3% less than a year before. The largest bank in the United States, JPMorgan, continues to be the driver of results, earning $13.4 billion, 6% more than in the first quarter of 2023, but this increase was mainly due to the incorporation of First Republic Bank, which it bought at a bargain price last year. Without this operation, its profit would only have grown by 1%. The president of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, spoke of a “normalization” of the interest margin and the cost of credit, which translates into a smaller difference between what the bank charges for loans and what it pays for deposits and other interest-paying products. The first quarter accounts reflect that interest income still grew by 28% year-on-year (partly due to higher volumes derived from the incorporation of First Republic Bank), but what is new is that interest expenses shot up by 49%. Furthermore, when quarters are compared sequentially, net interest income falls from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year. That normalization, Dimon said, will continue as clients move from non-interest-paying deposits to products with higher rates. The bank’s chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum, explained it in the conference with analysts: “We don’t think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings accounts are paying zero and the official interest rate is above 5% we are not going to see continuous migration,” he said. The same effect is more noticeable in Wells Fargo. Its interest income grew 18% to $22.84 billion, but interest expenses soared 76% to $10.2 billion. The lender attributes this to the impact of rising interest rates on financing costs, including the impact of customers migrating to higher-profit deposit products. With this, the interest margin was reduced by 8%, $12.2 billion, weighing down the income statement despite the improvement in commission income. Attributable consolidated profits also fell 8%, to $4.3 billion. The same happened with Bank of America, the second-largest bank in the United States. With a similar volume of deposits, interest expenses grew from $4.3 billion to $9.1 billion in one year. As a whole, higher payments on deposits and other products weighed down the interest margin and contributed to a 20% drop in profit, to $6.1 billion. Citi suffered a 27% decline in profit. The group’s accounts were are also affected by pressure on the interest margin, but not as much. The lender is going through its own restructuring and transition process, with severance expenses due to workforce reduction and lower income from the sale of businesses. Along with this, provisions for credit losses are growing strongly. After a dark period for the investment banking business, income from fees and profits are recovering. IPO activity has picked up and debt issuances have also skyrocketed, breathing new life into the accounts of Wall Street giants. Income from investment banking fees soared by 30%. This has especially benefited Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are most dependent on that line of business. Goldman stands out in commissions for placement and underwriting of share issues, where income soared 45%, to $370 million; income from debt issues rose 38% to $699 million, and advisory fees rose 24% to just over $1 million. Thanks to investment banking and trader activity, Goldman Sachs’ profit shot up 27% in the first quarter to $3.9 billion, surpassing Citi. In their case, the interest margin dropped, but this has little weight in their business. The same goes for Morgan Stanley, whose profit grew by 15% to $3.2 billion due to the 16% increase in its investment banking income and the good evolution of the brokerage and wealth management lines. Goldman surpassed JPMorgan in investment banking fees, which brought in $2 billion, 21% more than the previous year. This was especially due to the increase in commissions for debt issues, which shot up 58% to $1 billion. Shares also surged 51%, to $355 million, while advisory services fell sharply by 21%, to $598 million. Bank of America breaks down commissions differently, but it grows in all chapters, especially in issues. Altogether, investment banking fees increased by 35% to $1.6 billion. In the case of Citi, the trends are similar. Commissions on fixed-income and variable-income placements grew by around 60%, while insurance commissions fell by 17%. Overall, its investment banking fees rose 32% to $977 million. At Wells Fargo, investment banking fees soared 92%, to $627 million. The bank seeks to grow in that business, in which it is still relatively small. Banks continue to foot the bill for the 2023 bailouts of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. After the extraordinary provisions that battered their accounts at the end of 2023, lenders have had to provision new contributions again. In the case of JPMorgan, the additional amount has been $725 million and in Bank of America, about $700 million. Wells Fargo has had to allocate $284 million, while Citi has reserved an additional $251 million. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have a smaller balance sheet and fewer guaranteed deposits, have only had to contribute an additional $78 and $42 million, respectively.

PNC Financial Services, Valley Bank, Citizens Bank and BankUnited were also among the bidders, the FDIC said in a summary document, adding that one or more bidders submitted more than one bid. The bids, which closed on March 24, were followed by First Citizens BancShares purchasing all the loans and deposits of SVB later that month. SVB was the largest bank since the 2008 financial crisis to collapse when California regulators closed the bank on March 10, sparking massive market disruption and heightened stress across the banking sector globally. That was since eclipsed by First Republic Bank which was seized by regulators in early May and sold to JPMorgan Chase & Co. FDIC, which took over SVB after depositors rushed to pull out their money in the bank, received equity appreciation rights in its stock worth as much as $500 million in return. The deal announced in March said First Citizens would acquire SVB's assets of $110 billion, deposits of $56 billion and loans of $72 billion.

Bank ETFs in Focus on Mixed Q1 Earnings - Yahoo Canada Finance,Bank ETFs in Focus on Mixed Q1 Earnings  Yahoo Canada Finance,"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 12:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vY2EuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iYW5rLWV0ZnMtZm9jdXMtbWl4ZWQtcTEtMTIwMDAwMzUwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Canada Finance,"U.S. banking earnings have been an awaited one as investors’ view toward the banking sector has dwindled last year, thanks to the U.S. regional banking crisis emanating in March 2023 and investors’ shifting deposits to big banks. Although the crisis has subsided considerably, investors' attention will undoubtedly be focused on the earnings of the big banks as rising rate worries still loom. For example, JPMorgan JPM experienced a decline in its shares on Friday despite surpassing profit expectations, as CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted ""inflationary pressures"" and Fed’s tight monetary policy as sources of concern. Against this backdrop, we detail Q1 earnings results of key big banks. Notably, the financial sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the S&P 500 Index, had an upbeat-to-mixed Q1. Most of six big U.S. banks were able to beat overall this reporting season. Let’s delve a little deeper (read: 4 Top-Performing ETF Areas of Last Week): Big Bank Earnings in Focus High interest rates, the First Republic Bank deal, improvement in investment banking (IB) business and solid loan balance drove JPMorgan’s (JPM) first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings to $4.63 per share. The bottom line handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.18. Net revenues, as reported, were $41.93 billion, up 9% year over year. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.75 billion. Bank of America’s BAC first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of 83 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents. The bottom line compared unfavorably with the 94 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. Net revenues were $25.82 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.28 billion. However, the top line declined 1.7% from the prior-year quarter. Wells Fargo & Company’s WFC first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10. The adjusted figure excludes the impacts of expenses from the FDIC special assessment. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $1.23. Quarterly total revenues were $20.86 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.17 billion. Also, the top line rose 1.9% from the year-ago quarter. Citigroup Inc.’s C first-quarter 2024 net income from continuing operations per share of $1.58 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. However, the metric declined 28% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues, net of interest expenses, moved down 2% year over year to $21.1 billion in the first quarter. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.3 billion. The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS first-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $11.58 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.54. Also, the bottom line increased 16.3% from the year-earlier quarter. Net revenues for the quarter of $14.21 billion increased 16.3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.89 billion. Morgan Stanley’s MS first-quarter 2024 earnings of $2.02 per share handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. The bottom line compared favorably with $1.70 per share reported in the prior-year quarter. Quarterly net revenues were $15.14 billion, up 4% from the prior-year quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion. ETF Impact All the aforementioned companies have considerable exposure in funds like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF IYG, Invesco KBW Bank KBWB, Financial Select Sector SPDR XLF, U.S. Broker-Dealers Index Fund IAI and Vanguard Financials ETF VFH. Financials ETFs like IYG, KBWB, XLF, IAI and VFH were more-or-less downbeat past week (which was the key reporting season). The fund IYG was off 3.9%, KBWB has lost 7.1%, XLF has retreated 3.6%, IAI has slumped 3.8% and VFH has dropped 3.7% past week due to the current flattening of the yield curve. Having said all, given the decent valuation of the sector and chances of steepening yield curve in 2024, investors can keep track of these ETFs for gains.

The meeting agenda was unclear. Brainard met with a range of business leaders including Dimon, part of a series of meetings she has had over the last month with business, labor, advocacy, and academic leaders, the source said. The meeting comes as First Republic Bank's efforts to secure a capital infusion continued on Wednesday, as the troubled regional lender started to plan for the possibility it may need to downsize or get a government backstop. The CEOs of major banks gathered in Washington for a two-day meeting which started on Tuesday, sources familiar with the matter previously said. The quarterly meeting of the Financial Services Forum included Dimon and Bank of America Corp CEO Brian Moynihan, who head the nation's two largest lenders, the sources said. The banks were aiming to work out details for what needs to be done for First Republic within the coming 24 hours, another source said. Eleven lenders, including the eight members of the Financial Services Forum, threw First Republic a lifeline of a combined $30 billion in deposits last week. Major banks and private equity firms have so far balked at offering First Republic the capital infusion it craves for fear of releasing losses on the bank's loan book and investment portfolio amid a rise in interest rates. On Tuesday, Reuters reported First Republic is examining how it can downsize and sell parts of its business, including some of its loan book, in a bid to raise cash and cut costs.

Big U.S. banks create $30B rescue package for First Republic - Advisor's Edge,Big U.S. banks create $30B rescue package for First Republic  Advisor's Edge,"Fri, 13 Oct 2023 00:00:29 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdmlzb3IuY2EvaW5kdXN0cnktbmV3cy9pbmR1c3RyeS9iaWctdS1zLWJhbmtzLWNyZWF0ZS0zMGItcmVzY3VlLXBhY2thZ2UtZm9yLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Advisor's Edge,"Eleven of the biggest banks in the U.S. announced a $30-billion rescue package for First Republic Bank on Thursday, in an effort to prevent the California-based bank from becoming the third bank to fail in less than a week. First Republic serves a similar clientele as Silicon Valley Bank, which failed Friday after depositors withdrew about $40 billion. It appears that First Republic, which had deposits totaling $176.4 billion as of Dec. 31, was facing a similar crisis. (All figures are in U.S. dollars.) In a statement, the group of banks confirmed that other unnamed banks had seen large amounts of withdrawals of uninsured deposits, which are those that exceed the $250,000 level insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. First Republic’s shares dropped more than 60% Monday, even after the bank said it had secured additional funding from JPMorgan and the Federal Reserve. Thursday the bank’s shares were down as much as 36%, but rallied after reports the rescue package was in the works, and closed up nearly 9%. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have agreed to each put $5 billion in uninsured deposits into First Republic. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs would deposit $2.5 billion each into the bank. The remaining $5 billion would consist of $1 billion contributions from BNY Mellon, State Street, PNC Bank, Truist and US Bank. “The actions of America’s largest banks reflect their confidence in the country’s banking system,” the banks said in their statement. The nation’s banking regulators also issued a statement in support of the bank rescue package. “This show of support by a group of large banks is most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg. The news could help calm the nerves of bank investors after the collapse last week of Silicon Valley Bank, which was the second biggest bank failure in U.S. history after the demise of Washington Mutual in 2008. The shuttering of Silicon Valley Bank Friday and of New York–based Signature Bank two days later has revived bad memories of the financial crisis that plunged the United States into the Great Recession of 2007–2009.

Although the crisis has subsided considerably, investors' attention will undoubtedly be focused on the earnings of the big banks as rising rate worries still loom. For example, JPMorgan JPM experienced a decline in its shares on Friday despite surpassing profit expectations, as CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted ""inflationary pressures"" and Fed’s tight monetary policy as sources of concern. Against this backdrop, we detail Q1 earnings results of key big banks. Notably, the financial sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the S&P 500 Index, had an upbeat-to-mixed Q1. Most of six big U.S. banks were able to beat overall this reporting season. Let’s delve a little deeper (read: 4 Top-Performing ETF Areas of Last Week): Big Bank Earnings in Focus High interest rates, the First Republic Bank deal, improvement in investment banking (IB) business and solid loan balance drove JPMorgan’s JPM first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings to $4.63 per share. The bottom line handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.18. Net revenues, as reported, were $41.93 billion, up 9% year over year. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.75 billion. Bank of America’s BAC first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of 83 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents. The bottom line compared unfavorably with the 94 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. Net revenues were $25.82 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.28 billion. However, the top line declined 1.7% from the prior-year quarter. Wells Fargo & Company’s WFC first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10. The adjusted figure excludes the impacts of expenses from the FDIC special assessment. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $1.23. Quarterly total revenues were $20.86 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.17 billion. Also, the top line rose 1.9% from the year-ago quarter. Citigroup Inc.’s C first-quarter 2024 net income from continuing operations per share of $1.58 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. However, the metric declined 28% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues, net of interest expenses, moved down 2% year over year to $21.1 billion in the first quarter. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.3 billion. The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS first-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $11.58 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.54. Also, the bottom line increased 16.3% from the year-earlier quarter. Net revenues for the quarter of $14.21 billion increased 16.3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.89 billion. Morgan Stanley’s MS first-quarter 2024 earnings of $2.02 per share handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. The bottom line compared favorably with $1.70 per share reported in the prior-year quarter. Quarterly net revenues were $15.14 billion, up 4% from the prior-year quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion. ETF Impact All the aforementioned companies have considerable exposure in funds like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF IYG, Invesco KBW Bank KBWB, Financial Select Sector SPDR XLF, U.S. Broker-Dealers Index Fund IAI and Vanguard Financials ETF VFH. Financials ETFs like IYG, KBWB, XLF, IAI and VFH were more-or-less downbeat past week (which was the key reporting season). The fund IYG was off 3.9%, KBWB has lost 7.1%, XLF has retreated 3.6%, IAI has slumped 3.8% and VFH has dropped 3.7% past week due to the current flattening of the yield curve. Having said all, given the decent valuation of the sector and chances of steepening yield curve in 2024, investors can keep track of these ETFs for gains.

Citizens has “several imminent team lift-outs” from rivals that will underscore its wealth ambitions, Van Saun said on the company’s first quarter earnings call. Brendan Coughlin, Citizens’ head of consumer banking, added that the bank is talking with “some of the very best wealth managers across all the big brands in the United States.” “We’re going to be very selective,” Coughlin said, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. “We expect to board some top talent and really give a boost to our Wealth strategy.” Recruiters and a former First Republic Bank executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Citizens has entered the final stages of recruiting some large teams who had moved to JPMorgan Chase & Co. when it bought First Republic at a government auction last year. The Providence, Rhode Island-based bank has laid the groundwork for those hires over the past year and earlier this week named veteran Morgan Stanley private wealth manager Paul Casey to be head of wealth management effective June 9. Citizens also last year hired over 200 relationship managers from First Republic and launched a separate private wealth division helmed by former First Republic and Wells Fargo Advisors manager Tom Metzger. Van Saun has been optimistic about the firm’s ability to convert referrals from those relationship managers into customers of full-service advisors. “We were looking for a way to really scale up in wealth management and kind of finally crack that nut,” Van Saun said in a presentation in December. Citizens seeded its wealth management division, which has $24 billion in client assets, with the 2019 purchase of New York-based advisory firm Clarfeld Financial Advisors. Its assets under management rose 15% year-over-year, according to the earnings report. Van Saun and others have said that expansion into wealth will give the bank scale, more stable recurring revenue and increase its loans and deposits. Citizens had bid unsuccessfully on First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank last year during the regional banking crisis. The “imminent” hires will be the closest thing to any acquisitions that Citizens expects to make to grow the wealth division, Van Saun noted. “We’ll treat them like they’re kind of M&A transactions that are accretive and they fit our strategy and they’re good cultural fits,” Van Saun said. The remarks came as Citizens overall posted a 35% year-over-year drop in net income to $334 million from $511 million due largely to declines in net interest income. Revenue fell 8% to $1.96 billion from $2.13 billion.",https://www.advisorhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Brendan-Coughlin.jpg,2024-04-18,0.251,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase & Co.', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Morgan Stanley', 'description': 'U.S investment bank', 'full_name': 'Morgan Stanley', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Morgan-stanley-building.jpg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Paul Casey', 'description': 'Irish musician', 'full_name': 'Paul Casey'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Tom Metzger', 'description': 'American white supremacist leader', 'full_name': 'Tom Metzger'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bruce', 'latitude': 40.495811462402344, 'longitude': -104.86441802978516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Saun', 'latitude': 28.684940338134766, 'longitude': 82.14515686035156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Coughlin', 'latitude': 30.186880111694336, 'longitude': -93.85794830322266, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Providence', 'latitude': 41.82398986816406, 'longitude': -71.41282653808594, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Rhode Island', 'latitude': 41.75038146972656, 'longitude': -71.4997787475586, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Citizens Financial Group is actively recruiting top wealth managers, including teams from First Republic Bank, to expand its wealth management division.

All deliberations are at an early stage and an expansion of the Federal Reserve's emergency lending program is one of the many considerations by officials to support the failing lender, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the situation. While any changes to the Fed's liquidity offerings would apply to all eligible users, the adjustments could be designed to ensure that First Republic benefits from the changes, Bloomberg said. Representatives for the U.S. Treasury, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and First Republic Bank declined to comment. The Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment. U.S. banks have sought record amounts of emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve in the past month after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden's economic team worked with regulators to set up measures to support the banking system, including setting up a new facility to give banks access to emergency funds and making it easier for banks to borrow from the Fed in emergencies.

What does the First Republic Bank collapse mean for the banking industry? - The Business Standard,What does the First Republic Bank collapse mean for the banking industry?  The Business Standard,"Mon, 08 May 2023 07:48:58 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L3Rob3VnaHRzL3doYXQtZG9lcy1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1iYW5rLWNvbGxhcHNlLW1lYW4tYmFua2luZy1pbmR1c3RyeS02MjgxNTDSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy50YnNuZXdzLm5ldC90aG91Z2h0cy93aGF0LWRvZXMtZmlyc3QtcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1jb2xsYXBzZS1tZWFuLWJhbmtpbmctaW5kdXN0cnktNjI4MTUwP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Business Standard,"In the wake of the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse, concerns about the stability of the banking system have been amplified. With the potential for a domino effect to occur within the industry, experts have been closely monitoring the situation. Unfortunately, it seems that their fears have become a reality as the next victim of this ongoing crisis has been identified: First Republic Bank. As the situation continues to unfold, many are left wondering what the future holds for the banking industry as a whole. High-net-worth individuals receive commercial banking and wealth management services from First Republic Bank, a significant provider in the industry. With 93 offices across 11 states, including New York, California, Massachusetts, and Florida, the bank has $166 billion in outstanding loans receivable as of December 31, 2022, mainly secured by collateral in major metro areas. The bank has grown through strategic acquisitions such as the Private Client Asset Management division of Bay Isle Financial and Bank of Walnut Creek. After being acquired by Merrill Lynch for $1.8 billion in 2007, First Republic Bank was sold to a group of private investors for $1 billion in 2010 and became a public company again after an initial public offering in December of that year. Since then, First Republic Bank has demonstrated a steady expansion and development by procuring wealth management firms like Luminous Capital and Constellation Wealth Partners. Gradifi, a two-year-old startup that assists companies in supporting their employees to pay off their student loan debts, was also acquired by the bank in December 2016. While there were some hurdles along the way, such as the departure of 50 client advisors associated with the Luminous acquisition, First Republic Bank has managed to maintain its prominent position in the high-net-worth banking and wealth management industry. Despite the good track the bank was having, it hasn't been able to escape from the banking turmoil we are experiencing. On April 24th, the company reported earnings showing how in danger they were: revenues were down 13.4%, net interest income was down 19.4%, net income was down 32.9%, The diluted earnings per share saw a decline of 38.5%, while the net interest margin for the current quarter was 1.77%, a decrease from 2.45% in the previous quarter. In the bank's first update to investors since entering a free-fall over the past month and a half, its executives refused to answer questions about its first-quarter results. Even though its leaders did not want to talk, what is certain is that the bank appeared to be on the brink of collapse: it suffered a colossal loss of $102 billion in customer deposits, which accounts for more than half of the $176 billion it had held at the conclusion of the previous year. This substantial decline in deposits does not even consider the recent temporary aid of $30 billion granted by the largest banks in the country. During this same period, the bank acquired a loan of $92 billion, primarily from the Federal Reserve and government-supported lending organisations, effectively swapping its deposits with loans. This is a hazardous strategy for any bank, as they typically rely on acquiring relatively low-cost customer deposits and providing loans to homebuyers and businesses at significantly higher interest rates. Despite the risky manoeuvre, First Republic is still generating some profit, reporting a quarterly gain of $269 million, a decrease of one-third from the previous year. The bank issued fewer loans compared to earlier quarters, following a general banking trend, as executives in the industry are concerned about an economic downturn, as well as a decline in home sales and prices. In the aftermath of its earnings report, the bank's stock initially surged by more than 10%. Subsequently, it plummeted by approximately 20% during after-hours trading, exacerbated by executives' refusal to field analyst inquiries. On top of that, over the last half of a year, its share price decreased by 90%. The bank reassured investors by stating that the bulk of its deposit exodus had ceased by the end of March, with a mere 1.7% of its deposits lost between March 31 and April 21, primarily due to client tax payments. This decline was precipitated roughly six weeks prior when federal regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, prompting customers to withdraw billions of dollars in deposits. First Republic, situated in San Francisco, was one of the banks most markets to fail after the Silicon Valley collapse. In fact, it was particularly susceptible to a similar fate as it catered to many start-up companies, analogous to Silicon Valley Bank, and boasted numerous accounts holding over $250,000, the federal deposit insurance limit. Moody's recent downgrade of 11 regional lenders highlights the banking industry's challenges, with First Republic also struggling due to a $25 billion hole in its balance sheet. The bank is in talks with financial advisers and government officials to develop a plan to save itself, potentially involving the sale of the bank or parts of it or raising new capital. However, each party involved has different priorities, timelines, and constraints. Despite the bank's suspension of dividends and loss of wealth advisers, analysts believe it may still be able to operate as a stand-alone company. However, there are many actions that still have to be taken. First Republic has started addressing its issues by cutting its workforce by up to a quarter and reducing executive compensation. However, the future of this financial institution does not look very bright. This financial institution is struggling to find a buyer for the entire bank or sell portions of it separately. And if proper offers have not appeared already, it is hard to believe that they will appear in the future. The Federal Reserve cannot ease a takeover as it did in 2008. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may have to fail the bank, which would require approval from multiple agencies. If the bank fails, the government must decide whether to protect its uninsured depositors, which is a difficult decision. The fact that none of the largest banks in the US, such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citi Bank, or Wells Fargo, have made a competitive offer is especially alarming. Is First Republic Bank in an unhealthy financial situation, or is it that not even the big fish in the industry can afford to take it? For the good of humanity, hopefully, it is not the second case. Otherwise, we can get ready for the worst. Nonetheless, if this situation continues, the most logical conclusion would be for the bank to end up in the government's hands and ensure the safety of people's money. The recent downfall of First Republic Bank has once again brought the spotlight on the fragility of the banking system. The crisis has highlighted the importance of strong risk management practices that banks must adopt to withstand such unprecedented situations. It also emphasises the need for regulators to keep a close watch on the functioning of financial institutions to avoid similar instances from happening in the future. It is crucial for banks to maintain a proactive approach towards risk management, which involves identifying potential threats and taking necessary steps to mitigate them. Banks need to have robust mechanisms in place to monitor and assess the impact of risks and to have a contingency plan that can be implemented in case of a crisis. Regulators also play a critical role in ensuring the stability and sustainability of the financial system. They need to ensure that banks adhere to the regulations and guidelines set forth by them and take corrective actions in case of any non-compliance. As we pointed out a month ago, there was a potential domino effect if a bank collapses, and it seems like it is currently in motion. The failure of a bank not only affects its depositors and creditors but also undermines trust and confidence in the entire banking system. The interconnectedness of banks means that when one institution borrows from another, its collapse can trigger a chain reaction, causing more banks to fail until measures are taken to prevent it. This situation raises concerns about banks' transparency and reliability and creates uncertainty among customers who fear experiencing a similar fate. As a result, they may opt to withdraw their funds from smaller banks and deposit them in larger, more stable institutions or even choose to keep their money at home in cash. Such behaviour can cause a further chain reaction, as banks rely on deposits to lend to other customers and cannot immediately fulfil all withdrawal requests. This can eventually lead to the bank's collapse, further exacerbating the harm to the integrity of the banking system.",https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_3/public/images/2023/05/08/download_2.jpg,2023-05-08,-0.394,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Credit Suisse', 'latitude': 47.369598388671875, 'longitude': 8.539449691772461, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'High', 'latitude': 36.47090148925781, 'longitude': -93.5363998413086, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'latitude': 42.36565017700195, 'longitude': -71.10832214355469, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Florida', 'latitude': 28.750539779663086, 'longitude': -82.5000991821289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 47.548221588134766, 'longitude': 8.73900032043457, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Creek', 'latitude': 36.30792999267578, 'longitude': -78.0899887084961, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Silicon Valley', 'latitude': 37.369998931884766, 'longitude': -122.04000091552734, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Moody', 'latitude': 45.62622833251953, 'longitude': -120.91229248046875, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank of America', 'latitude': 37.79444122314453, 'longitude': -122.40306091308594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Citi Bank', 'latitude': 18.924930572509766, 'longitude': 72.8319091796875, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"First Republic Bank, a major provider of commercial banking and wealth management services, is facing financial difficulties.

The FDIC brokered the deal for Chase to take over First Republic following negotiations over the weekend and “a highly competitive bidding process,” according to a Monday statement. JPMorgan Chase will take control of all First Republic deposits and assets, and all 84 branches of First Republic Bank will reopen as branches of JPMorgan Chase during Monday business hours, the FDIC said. Customers with accounts at First Republic would be able to access their deposits by the beginning of Monday business hours, the FDIC said. The agency also said deposits with the bank will continue to be insured. As of April 13, First Republic Bank had about $229.1 billion in assets and $103.9 billion in deposits, the FDIC said. First Republic Bank had struggled in the wake of the abrupt collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which were both taken over by the FDIC in March. “I am pleased we were able to deal with First Republic’s failure without using the FDIC’s emergency powers. It is a grave and unfortunate event when the FDIC uses these emergency powers,” said FDIC Board of Directors member Jonathan McKernan in a statement, adding that “more work remains to be done” to strengthen the banking system and plan for failures. JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that the move is supporting the U.S. financial system as consumer confidence in banking wavers. “Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,” said Jamie Dimon, chairman of CEO of JPMorgan Chase. “Our financial strength, capabilities and business model allowed us to develop a bid to execute the transaction in a way to minimize costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund.” JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC together will cover the costs of losses on residential and commercial loans First Republic issued. The FDIC said the sale of First Republic likely will cost $13 billion from the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is the FDIC fund for protecting deposits at failed banks. The DIF had $128 billion at the end of 2022, but the FDIC was already forced to spend nearly $22.5 billion to handle the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March. Why did First Republic collapse? First Republic had been teetering for months after the collapses of SVB and Signature set off a banking crisis in March. The San Francisco-based regional powerhouse did not appear to have the same mismanagement issues as SVB, nor did it share Signature Bank’s unique relationship with the volatile cryptocurrency sector. But First Republic shared other major weaknesses with SVB, including steep losses on investment holding and holding the vast majority of its deposits above the FDIC’s insurance threshold. First Republic received $30 billion in March from a group of major U.S. banks — including JPMorgan Chase — to help stave off a collapse and restore customer confidence in the bank. Even so, First Republic’s woes deepened last week after a dire first-quarter earnings report showed the depth of its losses during the outbreak of the crisis. The dire financial numbers spurred a fresh round of panic over the health of the bank, spurring takeover discussions that stretched over the weekend.

The departures bring the one-day tally of teams leaving J.P. Morgan Advisors to at least six who represented nearly $16 billion in combined assets including a former First Republic group with $3.5 billion that joined Merrill Lynch in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. All but one of the teams had come to the New York-based bank from First Republic Bank, which JPMorgan purchased almost one year ago. J.P. Morgan had added around 200 former First Republic brokers as part of the May 2023 purchase, bringing its tally of traditional brokers to over 650. JPMorgan executives said last year the deal would double assets under management at J.P. Morgan Advisors to $400 billion if it retained all those who joined from First Republic. After an initial wave of defections when the purchase closed, attrition of former First Republic brokers stabilized, but recruiters and former wealth executives at the failed bank have said that some brokers have become frustrated with red tape at J.P. Morgan and are moving en masse after tax day and ahead of upcoming deadlines for transferring customer accounts to the bank’s custody. A J.P. Morgan spokesperson declined to comment. Citizens Adds in San Francisco In the largest of the previously unreported moves, Citizens hired an ex-First Republic team led by Rick Gordon and Hugh Beecher, who had generated $20 million in annual revenue, according to a source familiar with their practice. The team had managed $5 billion in client assets, a Citizens spokesperson confirmed. They are joining the bank’s private wealth unit launched in December by former First Republic and Wells Fargo Advisors manager Tom Metzger. Citizens executives foreshadowed some large hires on the company’s first quarter earnings on Wednesday. The Providence, Rhode Island-based company is seeking to accelerate growth at its wealth management division, which had $24 billion in client assets at the end of March. Citizens lost its bid for First Republic Bank but has hired over 200 of its bank-based relationship managers, who are expected to refer customers to Citizens brokers. “We continue to focus on attracting the most talented wealth managers in the industry and look forward to expanding,” Metzger said in a statement. Gordon and Beecher had joined First Republic in January 2015 from Barclays. Two San Francisco Teams Join Cresset Chicago-based registered investment advisory firm Cresset Capital Management added two teams who had nearly $5 billion in assets under management, a Cresset spokesperson confirmed. The hires are anchored by Dagny Maidman, who had just over $3 billion in assets, and generated around $15 million in revenue, according to the same source as above. Her group also includes nine support staff, according to Cresset. A Cresset spokesperson declined to comment on the broker’s production, and Maidman did not return a request for comment sent through LinkedIn. Maidman’s two former partners, Erik Ralston and Chris Chase, also joined Cresset in San Francisco. They had around $2 billion in assets combined, according to a Forbes listing, and moved along with three support staff. Maidman had joined First Republic along with Ralston and Chase in 2015 as their former firm, Credit Suisse, abandoned its U.S. brokerage business. The three decided to split several years ago into two separate groups, according to the source. Cresset had around $45 billion in assets under management as of April 1, according to the spokesperson. In April last year, it scooped up a multi-state ex-First Republic team with $13 billion in client assets. Wells Fargo Nabs Team in Palm Beach, Florida Separately, Wells Fargo Advisors has landed a six-person team from J.P. Morgan Advisors that produced $9.3 million in annual revenue in Palm Beach, Florida, near where the Merrill team had been based. The Rizzo, Apple, Schneider and Langbert Group managed $1.3 billion in client assets, a Wells spokesperson confirmed. The team is led by advisors Anthony W. Rizzo, Roy N. Apple, Jeremy S. Schneider and Brett A. Langbert and includes client associates Anna Vazquez and Brandon Jimenez, according to the team’s website. Their shift is at least the second billion-dollar hire for Wells Fargo in as many weeks. The wirehouse added a former Morgan Stanley team with $1.2 billion in assets and $9 million in revenue in Los Angeles last week. The Rizzo team could not immediately be reached for comment. Most had joined J.P. Morgan in 2014 from Deutsche Bank. Morgan Stanley Adds Solo Producer in San Francisco Separately, Ashley Evans, a $1.5 million producer who had joined First Republic from Merrill in 2021, moved to Morgan Stanley, according to the same source. She had been managing around $360 million in client assets, the source said, and ranked #96 on Forbes’ best-in-state women advisors list this year. Evans, who could not be reached for comment, started her career 16 years ago with Merrill predecessor Banc of America, according to BrokerCheck.

These job cuts are part of the integration process.JPMorgan, which acquired First Republic on May 1, had hinted at layoffs on the day of the deal announcement. Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, had said, “In connection with any job losses, we would emphasize that in the normal course, JPMorgan hires tens of thousands of people in the United States each and every year, which means that there will be many opportunities for career redeployment.”JPM has offered temporary or full-time roles to the 85% of First Republic employees. Notably, transitional positions will last three months to a year, depending on the type of job. In a statement, a JPMorgan spokesperson said, “We've been transparent with their employees and kept our promise to update them on their employment status within 30 days.”Those who haven’t been offered any role will get pay and benefits for two months and be offered packages that would include additional lump sum payments and continuing benefits coverage.Additionally, JPMorgan has informed that as it doesn’t provide personal lines of credit, it has no plans to offer them to former First Republic clients when they come up for renewal.Now coming to job cuts at Silicon Valley Bank. Majority of the layoffs were in the commercial banking business. The affected positions are neither client facing, nor were India-based support staff.Frank Holding Jr., FCNCA’s CEO, said, “Given the challenges faced by SVB in early 2023, it is increasingly clear that we must make decisions to right-size our scope and scale to remain competitive. As a result, we are taking difficult but necessary actions to ensure that our workforce and costs are appropriate for a bank our size.”First Citizens BancShares acquired Silicon Valley Bank on Mar 27. Silicon Valley Bank had collapsed and was seized by the regulators following heavy deposit outflows at the bank. Its failure rattled the banking industry and led to the collapse of Signature Bank and First Republic Bank.Signature Bank was sold to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. NYCB on Mar 20. NYCB, through its bank subsidiary, Flagstar Bank, acquired $38 billion in assets and assumed $36 billion of liabilities of Signature Bank while not buying any digital asset banking, crypto-related assets or the fund banking business.Though NYCB hasn’t announced any plans to lay off employees, the current challenging operating environment might lead to the same going forward.Over the past three months, shares of JPMorgan have lost 4.5%, while First Citizens BancShares stock has surged 71.1%.

Why First Republic Bank Stock Soared on Tuesday - Yahoo Movies UK,Why First Republic Bank Stock Soared on Tuesday  Yahoo Movies UK,"Fri, 19 Apr 2024 22:12:07 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvd2h5LWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLWJhbmstc3RvY2stMjExNTAwMDk2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Movies UK,"What's happening? Shares of First Republic Bank (NYSE: FRC) are soaring, rising by more than 12% as of 3:45 p.m. EST after the bank pleased Wall Street with a better-than-expected earnings report. The company reported that its pre-tax earnings increased 21.4% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year ago, driven by robust deposit and loan growth. Management also issued guidance that suggests 2019 could be a banner year for this fast-growing bank. So what First Republic carved out a niche as the relationship banker for wealthy households in major U.S. metropolitan areas spanning from Silicon Valley to New York City. That approach has served it well, helping it attract depositors who care more about service than interest rates, powering its bottom-line profitability. Image source: Getty Images. After years of double-digit annual growth in deposits, First Republic's fourth-quarter results showed little sign of slowing down. Average deposits increased 4.1% quarter over quarter and 14.5% year over year in the fourth quarter. Most impressively, it achieved this high rate of growth without substantial increases in the rates it pays its depositors. Its average deposit cost is 0.51% in the fourth quarter, up only modestly from 0.45% in the sequential quarter and up from 0.28% a year earlier. The bank's ""secret sauce"" is its checking accounts, which make up nearly 60% of deposits despite the fact the bank pays just 0.05% in interest on those deposits. Now what First Republic Bank's model is a simple one, built on the basic business of taking in deposits and making loans. On its fourth-quarter conference call with analysts, bank management laid out its guidance for 2019, calling for double-digit loan growth and little change in net interest margin in the coming year. Guidance calls for the bank to deliver a net interest margin of 2.85% to 2.95% in 2019, just slightly lower than its net interest margin of 2.96% in 2018. Any profit growth will be driven by volume, as management guided for loan growth to continue at a breakneck pace in the ""mid-teen"" percentages year over year. Wall Street took the message in stride: All signs suggest First Republic's growth story is far from over. More From The Motley Fool Jordan Wathen has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

First Republic bounces back as SVB panic lessens - Yahoo News Canada,First Republic bounces back as SVB panic lessens  Yahoo News Canada,"Fri, 19 Apr 2024 17:59:55 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmlyc3QtcmVwdWJsaWMtYm91bmNlcy1iYWNrLXN2Yi0xNjQ0NTM0NTAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo News Canada,"Shares of First Republic Bank, a financial institution in the United States that does business with startups, are rebounding today after a punishing start to the trading week. Caught in the wake of the shock collapse of erstwhile rival Silicon Valley Bank, shares of First Republic fell 62% yesterday. Investors, concerned that actions taken over the weekend by the American government to stem a potentially budding banking crisis might not be sufficient, sold First Republic and other, related banking stocks like PacWest and Western Alliance. Today they are all on the bounce: First Republic is up around 57% as of the time of writing, PacWest is up 76% and Western Alliance is up a comparatively modest 44%. Before the government stepped in to calm markets by ensuring that depositors were whole and liquid at SVB, there was concern in the financial world that smaller banks (measured by total assets) could lose their appeal as places to do business. After all, why risk banking with a smaller institution if it could fail, whereas larger institutions could be considered too large to do so? It now appears that a far greater portion of the American banking industry will not be allowed to fail in a disorderly fashion, making the First Republics of the nation a sufficiently safe place to bank. Hence, a share-price rebound today at many banks that took stick yesterday. While First Republic does work with tech clients, it is not as tech-centered as SVB was; First Republic's recent 8-K filing reported that ""no one sector [of its client base] represents more than 9% of total deposits,"" adding that tech was just 4%. Oddly, despite the massive decline and rebound in the value of banks like First Republic, they could wind up with a good run of new deposits, provided former SVB customers choose them over larger banks. It is possible to read the rebound in the value of smaller American banks as indication that investors consider the risk of contagion as falling. In contrast, yesterday when the same banks were crashing, we inferred the opposite. That's how fast the news has been moving in recent weeks.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_7yFsYh1fwC50Nw3d6Ygpg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_350/caaf980d3676eb9b1bfa5332c08feef6,2023-03-14,-0.028,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Western', 'latitude': 41.86528015136719, 'longitude': -91.64322662353516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"First Republic Bank shares rebounded 57% today after a 62% drop yesterday due to concerns over Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.

Despite its tech clientele, First Republic is not as tech-focused as SVB, with tech representing only 4% of its deposits. The rebound suggests investors believe the risk of contagion is decreasing."

Earnings Preview: First Republic Bank (FRC) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline - Yahoo Lifestyle Australia,Earnings Preview: First Republic Bank (FRC) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline  Yahoo Lifestyle Australia,"Sun, 21 Apr 2024 10:02:04 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYXUubGlmZXN0eWxlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZWFybmluZ3MtcHJldmlldy1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1iYW5rLTE0MDAwMjU0NS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Lifestyle Australia,"First Republic Bank (FRC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This San Francisco bank is expected to post quarterly loss of $4.18 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -309%. Revenues are expected to be $1.13 billion, down 18.9% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 175.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for First Republic Bank? For First Republic Bank, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that First Republic Bank will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that First Republic Bank would post earnings of $1.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.88, delivering a surprise of +3.30%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. First Republic Bank doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation postponed votes on two competing plans that would have given the agency more power to scrutinize asset managers after it was clear neither had the majority backing of the five-member board. Officials said they planned to refine the proposals. ""If these fund complexes are using their purportedly passive investment funds to push social policy, to influence bank policy, there's a real significant issue here,"" FDIC board member Jonathan McKernan said at the agency's public board meeting on Thursday. At issue is growing concern among some policymakers over large asset managers' expanding footprint in the banking sector, driven by the growth of index investing. They worry big asset managers are exerting undue influence on the management of companies in their portfolios, despite ostensibly being passive investors. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street together manage some $23 trillion and are often the largest investors in S&P 500 companies. Some policymakers also worry that passive investors' growing footprint in public companies reduces competition. Academic studies have come to varied conclusions. But consumer activists and U.S. Republican politicians have seized on the issue as a way to scrutinize the policies of the investment firms. Banking and asset management industry executives have resisted more scrutiny, arguing the current arrangement has proven itself. ""For more than 20 years, U.S. bank regulators have concluded that regulated funds' passivity commitments ensure they do not exercise control over the banks in which they invest,"" said a spokesperson for the Investment Company Institute, which represents investment funds. ""Any suggestion that this regulatory approach should be changed lacks substantiation and could harm fund investors."" 'PREMATURE' STEP One of the plans by McKernan, a Republican, would direct FDIC staff to regularly assess if asset managers are complying with ""passivity agreements"" not to leverage their investments to steer operations or push policies. If an asset manager is exerting influence, the FDIC would subject them to stricter regulation. However, FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said he believed this step to be ""premature,"" and that the agency should solicit more public feedback. A second proposal, backed by Gruenberg and offered by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra, who sits on the board, would remove an FDIC policy that requires the agency to defer to the Federal Reserve on passivity agreements involving bank holding companies. The proposal includes soliciting feedback on the growing role of asset managers in banks. Chopra argued the FDIC should be more directly involved in such matters, given the agency's responsibility for ensuring banks are safe. That plan was also shelved after Michael Hsu, acting Comptroller of the Currency, said he would not vote for either approach. Instead, he argued all three major U.S. bank regulators should work together on a consistent approach to policing bank control. ""Further research, analysis, and debate are clearly needed,"" Hsu said.

Los Angeles-based PacWest (NASDAQ:PACW) slipped by more than 7%. On Monday, the shares pared back gains after the bank cut its dividend, sparking fresh concerns over the state of its finances. PacWest said last week that it was mulling over its strategic options, including a possible sale. Peer Western Alliance (NYSE:WAL), meanwhile, lost over 5%. The Arizona-based lender has stressed that it has not seen elevated deposit outflows since the collapse of First Republic Bank. It also denied media reports that it is considering a sale and bringing on advisors to explore its options. Meanwhile, First Horizon (NYSE:FHN) moved down by nearly 6% and Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) shed more than 2.5%. The KBW regional bank index, a tracker of these companies, fell by a little above 0.7%. The declines come after a new survey of bank loan officers from the Federal Reserve showed that lending standards to U.S. households and businesses were tightening, although the responses from those who participated in the study suggested that this was due more to concerns over rising interest rates instead of the recent volatility surrounding regional banks. Even still, midsize lenders - which the study defined as banks with assets between $50 billion to $250 billion - were making access to credit more stringent in response to fears over their financial health, the Fed's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey seemed to indicate.

Trump is Gary Farro, a banker who is testifying on Friday about his work with Mr. Trump’s former lawyer and fixer on a $130,000 hush-money deal in 2016. Mr. Farro spent 15 years at First Republic Bank, where he was a senior managing director, according to his LinkedIn profile. That is the now-defunct institution where the lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, established an account for Essential Consultants L.L.C. Mr. Cohen had created Essential Consultants to pay a porn star, Stormy Daniels, as part of a nondisclosure agreement to bury her claim that she and Mr. Trump had sex in 2006. Mr. Cohen set up the account in October 2016 and funded it from his home equity line of credit at First Republic. He has previously said he did so to ensure his wife would not know about the transaction. About two weeks before the 2016 presidential election, he wired the payment to Keith Davidson, a lawyer for Ms. Daniels. After the hush-money payment became public, Ms. Daniels’s lawyer at the time, Michael Avenatti, provided NBC News with an email from an assistant to Mr. Farro confirming the transfer. Mr. Cohen had used his Trump Organization email address in the communications, but said at the time that company funds were not used.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/26/nyregion/26trump-trial-farro/26trump-trial-farro-facebookJumbo.jpg,2024-04-26,-0.367,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Donald J.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation postponed votes on two competing plans that would have given the agency more power to scrutinize asset managers after it was clear neither had the majority backing of the five-member board.

""If these fund complexes are using their purportedly passive investment funds to push social policy, to influence bank policy, there's a real significant issue here,"" FDIC board member Jonathan McKernan said at the agency's public board meeting on Thursday. At issue is growing concern among some policymakers over large asset managers' expanding footprint in the banking sector, driven by the growth of index investing. They worry big asset managers are exerting undue influence on the management of companies in their portfolios, despite ostensibly being passive investors.

Some policymakers also worry that passive investors' growing footprint in public companies reduces competition. Academic studies have come to varied conclusions. But consumer activists and U.S. Republican politicians have seized on the issue as a way to scrutinize the policies of the investment firms.

""For more than 20 years, U.S. bank regulators have concluded that regulated funds' passivity commitments ensure they do not exercise control over the banks in which they invest,"" said a spokesperson for the Investment Company Institute, which represents investment funds. ""Any suggestion that this regulatory approach should be changed lacks substantiation and could harm fund investors."" Advertisement Â· Scroll to continueReport this ad 'PREMATURE' STEP One of the plans by McKernan, a Republican, would direct FDIC staff to regularly assess if asset managers are complying with ""passivity agreements"" not to leverage their investments to steer operations or push policies. If an asset manager is exerting influence, the FDIC would subject them to stricter regulation. However, FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said he believed this step to be ""premature,"" and that the agency should solicit more public feedback. A second proposal, backed by Gruenberg and offered by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra, who sits on the board, would remove an FDIC policy that requires the agency to defer to the Federal Reserve on passivity agreements involving bank holding companies. The proposal includes soliciting feedback on the growing role of asset managers in banks. Chopra argued the FDIC should be more directly involved in such matters, given the agency's responsibility for ensuring banks are safe. That plan was also shelved after Michael Hsu, acting Comptroller of the Currency, said he would not vote for either approach. Instead, he argued all three major U.S. bank regulators should work together on a consistent approach to policing bank control. ""Further research, analysis, and debate are clearly needed,"" Hsu said.

Rhona Graff served as Trump's executive assistant and a senior executive at the Trump Organization for decades. Stationed outside Trump's office in Trump Tower, she handled his phone calls and schedule, engaging with those coming and going from meetings. Testifying for less than an hour, she told the court that she maintained a list of Trump's contacts, which included entries for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. Both women said they had sex with Trump and were paid for their silence before the 2016 election. Trump denies their allegations. Graff also said she had a ""vague recollection"" of seeing Daniels ""waiting in the reception area of the 26th floor"" of Trump Tower. After Graff's testimony, prosecutors called a bank executive named Gary Farro, who worked at First Republic Bank. He testified that Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, was his client when Cohen wired $130,000 in ""hush money"" to Daniels' attorney days before the election. Their turns on the witness stand came after the conclusion of testimony by Donald Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer. Over the course of four days, Pecker detailed his involvement in a ""catch and kill"" scheme to acquire the rights to damaging stories about Trump and keep them from public view, saying he did so to help Trump's campaign. Pecker testified about several meetings he said he had at Trump Tower, including a 2015 meeting where he said he agreed to be the ""eyes and ears"" of the Trump campaign. He said that arrangement led him to pay $150,000 to McDougal, a former model. He declined to put up the money to acquire Daniels' story weeks later. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The charges relate to reimbursements to Cohen for the $130,000 payment.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/26/6689ddff-e7bc-4f28-969a-28d6cf8cc7ba/thumbnail/1200x630g3/9d28eafbe3fb9d6f5b74ed1022da924e/gettyimages-2149699172.jpg?v=63c131a0051f3823d92b0d1dffb5e0e4,2024-04-26,-0.405,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Karen McDougal', 'description': 'American model and actress', 'full_name': 'Karen McDougal', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Karen_McDougal_2011.jpg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Michael Cohen', 'description': 'Paranormal writer', 'full_name': 'Michael Cohen'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Trump', 'latitude': 40.82838821411133, 'longitude': -81.34844970703125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Trump Tower', 'latitude': 40.76250076293945, 'longitude': -73.97444152832031, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Daniels', 'latitude': 37.73971939086914, 'longitude': -81.12471771240234, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Graff', 'latitude': 37.31755065917969, 'longitude': -92.28266143798828, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cohen', 'latitude': -22.710039138793945, 'longitude': 29.755229949951172, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'McDougal', 'latitude': 36.4375, 'longitude': -90.3902816772461, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Gary Farro, a bank executive from First Republic Bank, testified that Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, wired $130,000 in ""hush money"" to Daniels' attorney through the bank days before the election."

It marks the first time in history that a former U.S. president has been tried on criminal charges. Trump last April pleaded not guilty to a 34-count indictment charging him with falsifying business records to hide the reimbursement of a hush money payment his then-attorney Michael Cohen made to Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election. Apr 26, 4:08 PMFarro says Cohen became his banking client in 2015 Gary Farro, formerly a senior managing director at First Republic Bank, testified that he first met Michael Cohen when Cohen became a banking client of his in 2015, after one of Farro's colleagues left the bank. Asked why Cohen was assigned to him, Farro cited his ""ability to handle individuals who might be a little challenging."" ""Frankly, I didn't find him that difficult,"" Farro remarked. First Republic Bank had a branch across the street from Trump Tower, where Cohen worked. Farro said Cohen frequently visited the bank and eagerly told him that he worked for Trump. ""He was a lawyer or is a lawyer. I am not sure,"" Farro said about Cohen, who was disbarred in 2019. Prosecutors are now walking through First Republic Bank's policies for retaining documents. Prosecutors plan to use Farro as a custodial witness to authenticate records that will be used as evidence. Apr 26, 3:53 PMProsecution calls Gary Farro as next witness Following the conclusion of Rhona Graff's testimony, prosecutors called Gary Farro as their next witness. Farro currently works at Flagstar Bank. He said he is testifying voluntarily, though he said he received a subpoena prior to his testimony. Apr 26, 3:42 PMTrump greets longtime assistant after she steps off stand Former President Trump appeared to have a visible reaction when the DA's office called his longtime executive assistant to the stand, and he craned his chin up as she stepped up. He half-smiled, almost sadly. When exhibits were put on the screen during Graff's brief testimony, Trump leaned entirely forward toward the monitor on his table, squinting to see the documents. When Trump's attorney said to Graff, ""You don't want to be here, do you?"" Graff responded, ""That's correct."" Trump attorney Todd Blanche laughed, but Trump did not. At the end of Graff's testimony, when she got off the stand and made her way past Trump, he did something he hasn't done yet: He stood up from his seat to greet her, appearing to try to shake her hand. Apr 26, 3:28 PMGraff says Daniels was possibly in Trump Tower for 'The Apprentice' After longtime Trump assistant Rhona Graff testified that she vaguely recalled seeing Stormy Daniels on in the reception area on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, defense attorney Trump sought to reframe Graff's testimony as innocuous -- suggesting to Graff that Daniels was spotted in Trump Tower because she was being considered for a role on Trump's TV show, ""The Apprentice."" Graff, from the witness stand, confirmed that she was aware through ""office chatter"" that Daniels was being considered for the show. She said that Trump was frequently on the hunt for ""celebrities who were colorful, or interesting"" to ""bring new juice to the show."" As part of those musings, Graff said she became aware that Daniels was being considered. ""I vaguely recall hearing him say that she may be one of the interesting people who could be on the show,"" Graff testified. Apr 26, 3:06 PMGraff says Trump's contact entries included McDougal, Daniels Donald Trump kept contact information for two women who alleged they had sexual relationships with him, his longtime executive assistant testified Friday as the trial's second witness. After former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker concluded his historic testimony as the first witness in the first criminal trial of a former president, Graff, entered the courtroom with a cane. Trump turned to see her as she entered, but the two did not appear to make eye contact. Graff's testimony appeared to be a pick-me-up for jurors, who had been listening to the same voice on the witness stand for the better part of four days. Graff worked for the Trump Organization for 34 years, beginning in October 1987, and testified that she was responsible for keeping Trump's contacts and calendars. Graff said those contacts included Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels Graff testified that she created the contact entry for Karen McDougal that included two addresses, a cell phone number, and an email address. Under questioning from prosecutor Susan Hoffinger, Graff testified she had also entered a contact for Stormy Daniels. ""It contains her mobile phone number,"" Graff said. ""I have a vague recollection of seeing her in the reception area on the 26th floor."" Graff said she also knew Daniels was a porn star. Apr 26, 2:51 PMProsecutors call longtime Trump assistant Rhona Graff Prosecutors have called Donald Trump's longtime executive assistant Rhona Graff as their next witness. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker stepped down from the witness stand after a brief re-cross examination. Apr 26, 2:44 PMPecker explains alerting Cohen to Stormy Daniels story Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker retook his seat on the witness stand after lunch, and the jury appeared engaged when prosecutor Josh Steinglass asked Pecker to explain things directly to them. Pecker slightly turned to face the jury when answering. After the defense, during cross-examination, tried to suggest Pecker didn't want to get involved in the Stormy Daniels story for business and reputational reasons, Steinglass asked him to clarify. ""I said to Michael Cohen that after paying for the doorman story and the Karen McDougal story I wasn't going to pay anything further and I wasn't a bank,"" Pecker testified. ""I told (editor) Dylan Howard there is no possible way that I would buy the story for $120,000 and that I didn't want anything to do with a porn star."" Steinglass asked Pecker, ""Why did you reach out to Michael Cohen"" about Daniels' claim of a sexual liaison with Trump? ""Based on our original agreement, any stories regarding Mr. Trump that could be embarrassing, I would call Michael Cohen right away,"" Pecker said. ""You weren't going to print it? You weren't going to pay for it?"" Steinglass asked. ""Correct,"" Pecker responded. ""But you were still going to fulfill your obligation to tell Michael Cohen about it? So the campaign could squash it?"" asked Steinglass. ""Yes,"" Pecker responded. Apr 26, 2:03 PMTrump falsely claims his supporters are prevented from gathering As he has previously, former President Trump complained on social media this morning that his supporters were being kept from gathering outside the courthouse -- even though that's not the case. ""Security is that of Fort Knox, all so that MAGA will not be able to attend this trial,"" Trump posted before he entered the courtroom. But a small group of his supporters demonstrated this morning undisturbed in the designated protest area in the park outside the courthouse, where they've gathered each day of the trial this week. -ABC News' Brian Hartman Apr 26, 1:30 PMPecker reaffirms catch-and-kill was to benefit Trump Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker reiterated the basic terms of the catch-and-kill arrangement during his redirect examination, though he acknowledged he did not use the words ""catch-and-kill"" during his August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower. ""Did you specifically use the word catch-and-kill during that meeting?"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked. ""No, I did not,"" Pecker said. ""What was your understanding of the part of the agreement that involved money?"" Steinglass asked. ""It was my understanding that I would use the company's sources to hear any information that was coming out on Mr. Trump or the campaign related specifically to women who would be selling their stories,"" Pecker said, referencing a similar arrangement with then-gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger. ""My understanding is [for] those stories that come up, I would speak to Michael Cohen and tell him that these are the stories that are going to be for sale. If we don't buy them someone else will, and that Michael Cohen would buy them or make sure they don't ever get published. That was my understanding from that meeting,"" Pecker said. Pecker reiterated that he did not plan to publish the Karen McDougal story -- despite its value to the National Enquirer if it were true -- in order to help the Trump campaign. ""That would kind of be like National Enquirer gold?"" Steinglass asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker responded. ""Zero intention of publishing that story?"" Steinglass asked. ""That is correct,"" Pecker said. The purpose of the arrangement, according to Pecker, was to help Trump win the election. ""You killed the story because it helped the candidate Donald Trump?"" Steinglass asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker said. Apr 26, 1:11 PMProsecutors dispute that Trump arrangement was 'standard' On redirect examination, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass sought to dismantle defense attorney Emil Bove's claim that former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's actions on behalf of Donald Trump were nothing more than ""standard operating procedure"" in the tabloid industry. Steinglass cited Pecker's previous testimony that nondisclosure agreements were commonplace in the course of his work. But, Steinglass asked, ""On how many others did the CEO -- meaning you -- coordinate with a presidential candidate for the benefit of their campaign?"" ""That was the only one,"" Pecker said. Referring to Michael Cohen's input on AMI's negotiation with Karen McDougal, Steinglass asked, ""Is it standard operating procedure ... to have a presidential candidate's campaign person weighing in on what terms of a contract are to be amended?"" ""No,"" Pecker replied. Steinglass ticked through several other matters related to Pecker's arrangement with Trump, including whether it was common practice to offer a political candidate the opportunity to ""accept or reject"" stories,"" or for the paper to ""run attacks"" on their opponents. Each time, Pecker answered ""No"" -- that they were not common practice. Apr 26, 12:52 PMPecker testifies that Cohen was prone to exaggeration Facing questions from Trump's attorney, former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker conceded that Michael Cohen was prone to exaggeration. ""Based on your experiences, Michael Cohen was prone to exaggeration?"" Trump attorney Emil Bove asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker agreed. ""Could not trust everything he said?"" Bove asked, before an objection from prosecutors interrupted that line of questioning. Earlier, Bove continued to try to highlight inconsistencies regarding the financial component of the ""catch and kill"" arrangement discussed at the 2015 Trump Tower meeting. At one point, Bove pointed to statements Pecker's attorneys previously made to federal prosecutors over information about the meeting that was included in Pecker's non-prosecution agreement. ""Your attorneys said to the DA that 'part of paragraph 3 was both wrong and inaccurate' -- do you remember that?"" Bove asked. ""No,"" Pecker said. As the sometimes-heated cross-examination wrapped up, Pecker remained firm in his testimony. ""I've been truthful to the best of my recollection,"" he said. Apr 26, 12:07 PMDefense suggests AMI's cooperation was financially motivated When the National Enquirer's parent company AMI signed a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in New York in September 2018, AMI was negotiating to sell the Enquirer and two other tabloids to Hudson News Group for $100 million, former publisher David Pecker testified under cross-examination. Defense attorney Emil Bove suggested the pending sale put Pecker under pressure to resolve a federal campaign finance investigation over its payment to quash stories damaging to Donald Trump's presidential ambitions. ""You knew to finalize that deal, to consummate it, you had to clear out the investigations?"" Bove asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker responded. ""From a timing standpoint it would have added stress to the transaction."" On Thursday Pecker testified he had been ""very worried"" about the investigation. He had received a letter from the Federal Election Commission and said he called up Michael Cohen. ""I said 'I'm very worried,'"" he testified. Pecker said Cohen responded, ""Why are you worried? Jeff Sessions is the Attorney General and Donald Trump has him in his pocket."" The defense appears to be suggesting AMI cooperated with federal campaign finance investigations not because the company had done anything wrong related to the 2016 Trump campaign, but out of financial considerations in order to preserve the $100 million deal with Hudson News, which was finalized in April 2019. Apr 26, 11:31 AMPecker reiterates that he didn't want Stormy Daniels' story Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified on cross-examination that the publication's limited involvement in Stormy Daniels' hush money payment was unrelated to the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where Pecker vowed to serve as the ""eyes and ears"" of Trump's presidential campaign. Pecker's testimony on cross-examination about the Daniels story appeared consistent with his testimony yesterday about his strong desire not to be involved in the Stormy Daniels payment. Pecker said yesterday that he did not want to be involved in the story due to concerns about reputational harm to the National Enquirer and a lack of reimbursement for the other payments he had made to suppress previous Trump stories. ""I said, we already paid $30,000 to the doorman, we paid $150,000 to Karen McDougal, and I am not a bank. I am not paying out any further disbursements among us,"" Pecker testified yesterday. Pecker said he instructed National Enquirer Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard to flag the Stormy Daniels story to Michael Cohen, who made the payment to Daniels himself. Asked about Daniels' payment on cross-examination, Pecker said that the National Enquirer's limited involvement was unrelated to their vow to Trump. ""You did not consider the Stormy Daniels story to be part of any agreement you had in August 2015?"" defense attorney Emil Bove asked. ""That is correct,"" Pecker said. ""You wanted nothing to do with it?"" Bove said. ""That's correct,"" Pecker said. Pecker added that he did not ""authorize"" Howard to continue communicating with Stormy Daniels' lawyer Keith Davidson about the payment. When Howard raised concerns to Pecker that Davidson had not yet been paid by Michael Cohen, Pecker said he was angry that Howard continued to communicate with Davidson about the story. In addition to the nature of the story -- which Pecker said could endanger the National Enquirer's relationship with its distributors -- Pecker said Cohen's delay in paying Daniels' lawyer could result in reputational harm to the National Enquirer. ""Frankly, you were not happy to be hearing that?"" Bove asked about Cohen's delayed payment. ""Yes,"" Pecker said. ""The main concern was Howard's reputation?"" Bove asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker said. Apr 26, 10:55 AMDefense questions Pecker about Michael Cohen David Pecker might be the only witness on the stand, but defense attorneys appear to be using the former National Enquirer publisher's testimony to go after Michael Cohen. Under questioning from defense attorney Emil Bove, Pecker said that Cohen at one point asked for his help getting a job with a New-Jersey based company. It wasn't clear when exactly the request was made. The company promptly rejected the offer, Pecker testified. ""They had no interest in Michael Cohen,"" Pecker said bluntly. Pecker also testified that Cohen asked for help sending paparazzi to one of his meetings, then publishing the photos in the National Enquirer. ""That would put pressure on President Trump to treat Cohen differently?"" Bove asked about why Cohen wanted the paparazzi. ""Yes,"" Pecker said. Bove's use of the term ""President Trump"" whenever he references his client led to a minor complaint from prosecutors this morning. ""He was not president Trump in June of 2016,"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said. Apr 26, 10:43 AMPecker says 'catch and kill' wasn't discussed at meeting Defense attorney Emil Bove sought to distance former President Trump from the National Enquirer's purchase of negative stories about him and instead suggested David Pecker and Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen may have been freelancing. Bove asked Pecker about a meeting at Trump Tower in August 2015 where Pecker previously testified he agreed to be the ""eyes and ears"" of the Trump campaign. ""At that meeting, the concept of catch and kill was not discussed, correct?"" Bove asked. ""That's correct,"" Pecker answered. The defense also sought to reframe the Enquirer's $30,000 purchase of Trump World Tower doorman Dino Sajudin's false claim that Trump fathered a love child. Bove suggested Enquirer parent AMI purchased the story not to help the Trump campaign, but because it was an irresistible tabloid scoop. ""Sajudin threatened to go somewhere else?"" Bove asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker responded. ""That is why you paid him $30,000?"" Bove asked. ""It would be too great a loss to AMI to lose the story, if true?"" ""Yes,"" Pecker answered. ""You could not walk away from that possibility?"" asked Bove. ""Yes,"" replied Pecker. Apr 26, 10:28 AMPecker says arrangement supporting Trump wasn't unusual Trump attorney Emil Bove, continuing his cross-examination of former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, returned to a theme he emphasized yesterday: that the National Enquirer's supportive arrangement with Trump was not unique, but rather ""standard operating procedure."" Bove is seeking to establish that negative stories about Donald Trump's political opponents in the National Enquirer largely involved ""information that was already in the public domain"" -- recycled narratives and reporting found in other outlets. ""There wasn't much new content in those stories, was there?"" Bove asked Pecker. ""Yes,"" Pecker said. ""It was a business decision that it was good for the National Enquirer to run those stories,"" Bove said, adding that, as a business model, it was ""quick, efficient, and cost-effective"" -- to which Pecker agreed. Bove cited stories about Bill and Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson as examples. Apr 26, 9:49 AMDefense resumes cross-examination of David Pecker ""Good morning, everyone,"" Judge Juan Merchan said at the start of the proceedings. ""Good morning, Mr. Trump."" Trump did not audibly respond. The former president is sitting slightly slouched at the defense table between defense lawyers Emil Bove and Todd Blanche. Merchan announced that the contempt hearing originally scheduled for next Wednesday -- related to the four new violations of the limited gag order alleged by prosecutors -- has been moved to Thursday at 9:30 a.m. ET. Defense attorney Emil Bove has resumed his cross-examination of former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker. Apr 26, 9:43 AMTrump bemoans cold conditions in courtroom Before entering the courtroom for today's proceedings, former President Donald Trump spoke to reporters, repeating his claims that Judge Juan Merchan is a ""highly conflicted judge"" overseeing a ""rigged trial."" Trump also expressed his annoyance about the ongoing cold conditions in the courtroom, on a day where it's a brisk 50 degrees in lower Manhattan. ""So we have another day of court in a freezing courthouse, it's very cold in there,"" he said. ""On purpose, I believe. They don't seem to be able to get the temperature up. It shouldn't be that complicated. But we have a freezing courthouse, and that's fine."" Apr 26, 8:30 AMCross-examination of David Pecker set to continue Defense attorney Emil Bove is scheduled to continue his cross-examination of former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker this morning, on Day 8 of former President Donald Trump's hush money trial. On Thursday, under direct examination, Pecker detailed his publication's ""catch-and-kill"" deal with Trump, explaining how his publication paid Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 for the exclusive rights to her story about an alleged year-long relationship she had with Trump, then kept it under wraps so it wouldn't ""embarrass Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the campaign."" Under cross-examination from Bove, Pecker testified that there was ""nothing wrong"" with those kind of arrangements, and that they were ""standard operating procedure"" for publications like his, listing several politicians -- including Rep. Rahm Emanuel and Arnold Schwarzenegger -- for whom he had caught and killed stories. Apr 25, 5:16 PMTrump calls day's court proceedings 'breathtaking' Former President Trump, exiting the courtroom at the end of Day 7 of his trial, called the day's court proceedings ""breathtaking."" He specifically remarked on the Supreme Court's hearing this morning on his bid for presidential immunity in his federal election interference case, which Trump was forced to miss due to his criminal trial. ""I heard the meeting was quite amazing. The justices were on their game,"" Trump said. Apr 25, 4:40 PMProsecutor objects to defense questions before court is adjourned Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass alleged that defense attorney Emil Bove used a ""totally improper line of questioning"" during Bove's cross-examination of former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker. Judge Juan Mechan, addressing Bove, at one point raised his voice slightly, saying, ""Are you missing my point? Because I don't think you are responding to what I am saying."" Merchan said that the jurors will be corrected about the alleged misimpression at the start of court tomorrow. The judge then adjourned the day's proceedings, with court scheduled to resume at 9:30 a.m. ET Friday. Apr 25, 4:31 PMPecker says AMI paid to kill stories for Schwarzenegger In his cross-examination of David Pecker, the former National Enquirer publisher who ran the publication's parent company, AMI, defense lawyer Emil Bove sought to draw a contrast between AMI's conduct with Donald Trump and its work with another celebrity-turned-politician: Arnold Schwarzenegger. Earlier today, Pecker testified about an agreement with Schwarzenegger ahead of the actor's run for California governor. According to Pecker, Schwarzenegger agreed to serve as an editor-at-large for some of AMI's fitness magazines in exchange for help quashing negative stories about Schwarzenegger's past interactions with women. ""A number of women called up the National Enquirer about stories that they have to sell on different relationships or contacts and sexual harassment they felt that Arnold Schwarzenegger did,"" Pecker said. ""The agreement I had with Arnold was I would call him and advise him of any stories that were out there."" Pecker described that his arrangement with Schwarzenegger -- which he said resulted in an ""embarrassing"" investigation into AMI's conduct -- provided him with some foundational experience when he began identifying and killing stories for Trump. ""That's how I became sensitive on this topic,"" Pecker. Pressed on cross-examination about the arrangement with Schwarzenegger, Pecker acknowledged that AMI spent its own money to kill stories about the former California governor. ""It was hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" Pecker said. ""And Mr. Schwarzenegger never paid you back for that?"" Bove asked. ""No, he didn't,"" Pecker said. Pecker also testified about an effort to compel Tiger Woods to do an interview with AMI's fitness magazines by purchasing a negative story about him as leverage. Apr 25, 4:15 PMPecker tells defense that killing stories is 'standard' procedure Former President Trump's attorney Emil Bove began his cross-examination of Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker by seeking to painting Pecker and Trump's ""mutually beneficially"" relationship as one that had nothing to do with the election but rather had been underway for years under a ""standard operating procedure."" ""Seventeen years of providing President Trump with a heads-up about potentially negative publicity?"" Bove asked Pecker. ""That's correct,"" Pecker said. Bove asked Pecker about the first time he ever provided Trump with information -- which Pecker testified was in the 1990s and related to a negative story about Marla Maples, Trump's ex-wife. ""Fair to say that predated the Trump Tower meeting by a long time?"" Bove asked of Pecker and Trump's relationship. ""Yes,"" Pecker said. ""A lot of interactions?"" Bove asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker responded. Bove also sought to show that kind of relationship between publishers and politicians was normal, saying there was ""nothing wrong about"" it. ""You are aware many politicians work with the media to try to promote their image?"" Bove asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker responded. ""That's standard operating procedure?"" Bove again asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker said. ""And sometimes when politicians are doing that, that is to try to win elections?"" Bove continued. ""Right,"" Pecker responded. ""Nothing wrong about that?"" Bove asked. Apr 25, 3:29 PM'I still consider him a friend,' Pecker says of Trump Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker concluded his direct examination by offering kind words about the former president. ""I felt that Donald Trump was my mentor. He helped me throughout my career,"" Pecker said, detailing how Trump reached out to help after one of Pecker's employees died from an anthrax attack in 2001. ""The first person who called me if I needed help was Donald Trump, and he was very helpful,"" Pecker said. Pecker confirmed that he has not spoken to Trump since early 2019, though the former president sent his regards through mutual friends who saw the former president at Mar-a-Lago. ""I thought the investigation that was going on at the same time -- I thought it was inappropriate to respond or have any conversations with Mr. Trump,"" Pecker said. Pecker said he still considers Trump to be a friend. ""I have no ill will at all,"" Pecker said about Trump. ""Even though we haven't spoke … I still consider him a friend."" Apr 25, 3:17 PMPecker details his non-prosecution agreement with DA When former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker received a letter from the Federal Election Commission in September 2018, ""I called up Michael Cohen immediately,"" Pecker said. Cohen said he had also received a letter from the FEC -- but urged Pecker not to fret. ""He says,' Why are you worried?' He said, 'Jeff Sessions is the attorney general and Donald Trump has him in his pocket,'"" Pecker testified. Pecker then described the non-prosecution agreement his company, AMI, struck with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, which included details about the catch-and-kill arrangement he had brokered with Cohen. Pecker read for the jury passages from the non-prosecution agreement, including a reference to AMI's deal to pay Karen McDougal -- described in the agreement only as ""the model"" -- for her story, ""so as to prevent it from influencing the presidential election."" Apr 25, 3:04 PM'I thought we had an agreement,' Pecker says Trump told him After court resumed for the afternoon session, David Pecker retook the stand. The former National Enquirer publisher testified that six months after Donald Trump became president, Trump hosted a ""thank-you dinner"" for Pecker and some of his business associates. After taking photos in the Oval Office -- ""Jared Kushner was there, Sean Spicer was there"" Pecker said -- Trump asked Pecker to walk with him along the colonnade ""past the Rose Garden,"" Pecker recalled. The jury saw a photo of the two men on that walk. Trump said that on that walk, Trump asked Pecker, ""How's Karen doing?"" referring to Karen McDougal, who the National Enquirer had paid to catch-and-kill her story claiming a year-long relationship with Trump. ""She's doing well. She's quiet. All's going good,"" Pecker recalled responding. Eight months later, in March 2018, Pecker said Trump called him about a television interview McDougal had conducted. ""He said 'Did you see the Anderson Cooper interview with Karen McDougal?' I said yes. He said, 'I thought we had an agreement with Karen that she can't give any interviews or be on any television shows.' So I said yes we have an agreement, but I amended it,"" said Pecker, who testified earlier that he had done so following the election. Pecker testified that Trump was very upset. ""He couldn't understand why,"" Pecker said. ""He couldn't believe that I did it."" Pecker said Trump also called him after Stormy Daniels appeared on a television interview a short while later. ""He said, 'We have an agreement with Stormy Daniels that she cannot mention my name or do anything like this, and each time she breaches the agreement it's $1 million penalty,'"" Pecker said. Apr 25, 1:42 PMPecker says 'family was never mentioned' as reason for killing stories Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker concluded his morning testimony by answering questions about what he perceived to be Trump's motivation to silence negative and salacious stories about him. ""I thought it was for the campaign,"" Pecker said. ""His family was never mentioned."" Pecker added that Trump's motivation for killing stories appeared to change once he announced his run for the presidency. ""Prior to the election, if a negative story was coming out with respect to Donald Trump and we spoke about it, he was concerned about Melania Trump and Ivanka, what the family might hear or say about it, whether it was true or not,"" Pecker said. Things changed when Trump changed from a businessman to a politician, Pecker said. ""I didn't hear or discuss that it was what [would] Melania say or what Ivanka would say or what his family would say, but the impact it would have upon the election,"" Pecker said, before court recessed for the afternoon break. As Trump left the courtroom for the lunch break, a reporter shouted him a question: ""Do you still like Pecker?"" They did not get a response. Pecker's testimony is scheduled to resume following the break. Apr 25, 1:19 PM'Thank you for handling' McDougal, Pecker says Trump told him Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that he was twice summoned to Trump Tower in the period following the 2016 election: the first time for a meeting with Michael Cohen, and the second with Donald Trump. The first meeting began in Cohen's office, where Cohen divulged for the first time to Pecker that he personally covered the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, and that he was concerned that he would not receive a bonus from the Trump Organization, Pecker testified. ""He (Cohen) asked me to talk to the boss on his behalf to try to help him get his bonus,"" Pecker said, referring to Trump. When Trump himself came into the room, Pecker asked to walk him back to his office -- and at that time, Pecker told Trump that ""Michael Cohen is very concerned about his bonus for this year, and I want you to know that he's very loyal."" Trump replied that Cohen had several apartments and taxi medallions, and added, ""Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it,"" Pecker said. On Jan. 6, 2017, Pecker arrived at Trump Tower for a meeting with Trump and was escorted to his residence by Jared Kushner, he testified. Pecker said he was ushered into the room, where Trump was surrounded by administration officials James Comey, Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus, and Mike Pompeo -- they were ""updating Mr. Trump on the Ft. Lauderdale shooting"" at the airport there. Pecker said that after the others had left, Trump turned to him. ""He (Trump) asked me how Karen [McDougal] was doing -- how's 'our girl' doing. I said, she's writing her articles, she's quiet, things are going fine."" Trump then said, ""I want to thank you for handling the McDougal situation. And then he said, I want to thank you for the doorman situation,"" Pecker testified. Upon additional questioning, Pecker testified that he took this to mean that Trump was thanking him ""for not publishing any of the stories and helping the way I did."" Apr 25, 1:07 PMPecker says he released McDougal from agreement after election After the Wall Street Journal ran a story that began to uncover the catch-and-kill arrangement between National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, Donald Trump and Trump's then-attorney Michael Cohen, Pecker testified that he ordered National Enquirer's Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard to contact McDougal's lawyer to ensure that she maintained her silence. ""I didn't know if she went off the reservation, so I asked Dylan to call Keith Davidson,"" Pecker testified before he began reading through a series of text messages from the 2016. ""She's cool. Moving forward with the [confidentiality agreement],"" Howard texted Pecker. ""Excellent news,"" Pecker texted back. ""One day of discomfort and back [to] the campaign issues,"" Howard texted. Days later, Trump was elected president of the United States. ""Is it fair to say that by the time of this [release from the agreement] … Mr. Trump has already been elected president?"" Steinglass asked. Apr 25, 1:00 PMTrump was 'very upset' about Wall Street Journal story, Pecker says It was November 4, 2016 -- four days before the presidential election -- and the Wall Street Journal ran a story that began to uncover the catch-and-kill arrangement between National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, Donald Trump and Trump's then-attorney Michael Cohen. ""National Enquirer Shielded Donald Trump From Playboy Model's Affair Allegation,"" the headline read. Pecker, on the stand, testified that he soon got a call at his home from Donald Trump directly. ""Donald Trump was very upset, saying, 'How could this happen, I thought this was under control,'"" Pecker said, adding that Trump suggested it was a leak from the National Enquirer. ""He was very agitated. He couldn't understand how this could happen, and the call ended up very abruptly."" Pecker said his company promptly issued a statement denying the story. ""Was that the truth?"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked. ""No, it was not,"" Pecker said. Asked why he issued the denial, Pecker said, ""I wanted to protect my company, I wanted to protect myself, and I wanted also to protect Donald Trump."" Apr 25, 12:29 PM'This story is true,' Pecker recounts being told of Stormy Daniels ""Do you know someone by the same of Stephanie Clifford?"" The question, by assistant district attorney Josh Steinglass, was the jury's introduction during the evidentiary phase of the trial to the woman whose long-denied claim of a sexual tryst with Donald Trump set in motion the alleged falsification of business records. ""Stormy Daniels is, or was, a porn star,"" former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker replied, using Clifford's stage name. Pecker was having dinner with his wife on a Saturday night in early October 2016 when he said he received an urgent call from National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard. ""He said that she, she being Stormy Daniels, is trying to sell a story that she had a sexual relationship with Donald Trump, and Dylan can acquire the story for $120,000 from Keith Davidson if we made a decision right now,"" Pecker recalled. In a series of text messages the jury saw, Howard told Pecker, ""I know denials were made in the past but this story is true."" Pecker replied to Howard, ""We can't pay 120k."" The company had already paid $30,000 for the Dino Sajudin story and $150,000 for the Karen McDougal story, and Pecker recalled thinking, ""I am not a bank."" In the text exchange, Howard responded, ""Perhaps I call Michael and advise him and he can take it from there, and handle."" Pecker texted back, ""Yes a good idea."" Pecker recalled having ""a number of conversations"" with Michael Cohen about Stormy Daniels. Cohen wanted Pecker to catch and kill the story. ""I said, 'I am not purchasing this story, I am not going to get involved with a porn star,'"" Pecker testified he told Cohen. ""He was upset and said the boss would be furious with me."" Apr 25, 11:58 AMPecker says he was never repaid for McDougal's catch-and-kill Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker described his concern about Trump's repayment for the catch-and-kill purchase of Karen McDougal's story showing up in his company's accounting system, and his efforts to hide it. Pecker testified that he put a different label on the invoice to Trump attorney Michael Cohen's LLC for the repayment because he ""did not want to have a payment received in the his company's finance department from the Trump Organization or Michael Cohen."" ""Why not?"" the prosecutor asked him. ""Because I believed that that payment would raise a lot of questions and issues,"" Pecker testified. Pecker also suggested he became uncomfortable with being reimbursed by Trump or Cohen after speaking with his legal counsel. Lastly, Pecker testified about his repeated efforts to get that repayment -- which he said never happened. ""To be clear, Mr. Pecker, did AMI ever get reimbursed?,"" the prosecutor asked, referring to the Enquirer's parent company. ""No,"" Pecker answered. Apr 25, 11:49 AM'The boss will be angry' if the deal is off, Pecker says he was told Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker described one of the most heated moments so far during the catch-and-kill arrangement between him, Donald Trump and Trump's then-attorney Michael Cohen. ""I called Michael Cohen and I said to him that the agreement we signed -- the deal was off. I am not going forward, it is a bad idea,"" Pecker testified. ""I want you to rip up the agreement."" ""He was very, very, angry. Very upset, screaming basically at me. And I said, I'm not going forward with this agreement, rip it up,"" Pecker said. Pecker said Michael Cohen then brought up ""the boss."" ""And Michael Cohen said, the boss is going to be very angry with you. And I said, I'm sorry, I am not going forward. The deal is off,"" Pecker recounted. ""And he said, I cant believe it. I'm a lawyer, I'm your friend. I don't understand why you're not going forward. I said I am not going forward. Period."" Pecker did not say exactly what prompted that exchange, but he previously described at length that he was aware that the National Enquirer's payment to Karen McDougal in order to catch and kill her story for the benefit of Trump's campaign would amount to an illegal campaign contribution -- softening his tone when he testified to this. Apr 25, 11:05 AMPecker says McDougal's story could have 'hurt the campaign' Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that he believed Donald Trump had knowledge about the $150,000 contract to buy Karen McDougal's silence regarding an alleged year-long affair. ""Do you know if anyone else besides Michael Cohen had any knowledge of this contract?"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked. ""Yes, I believe Donald Trump did,"" Pecker responded. ""Was your principal purpose to suppress the story to prevent it from influencing the election?"" Steinglass asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker said. ""Were you aware that expenditures by corporations made for the purpose of influencing an election made in coordination with or at the request of a candidate or campaign were unlawful?"" Steinglass asked. Pecker said he was aware and confirmed that the Enquirer's parent company, AMI, never reported the payment to the Federal Election Commission. ""We purchased the story so it wouldn't be published by any other organization,"" Pecker said. ""Why did you not want it to be published by any other organization?"" Steinglass asked. ""We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the campaign,"" Pecker said. ""Who is we?"" Steinglass followed up. ""Myself and Michael Cohen,"" Pecker said. According to Pecker, AMI agreed to the $150,000 payment on the promise that Donald Trump or the Trump Organization would reimburse AMI for the payment. He frequently followed up with Cohen about the reimbursement and got a similar answer from Cohen. ""Why are you worried? I am your friend. The boss will take care of it,"" Pecker said about Cohen's response. Apr 25, 10:44 AMPecker describes $150,000 negotiations for McDougal's story With Donald Trump following along from the defense table, head cocked slightly to the side, David Pecker described the negotiations conducted with Karen McDougal to purchase the exclusive rights to her story about an alleged year-long relationship with Trump. Pecker said that Trump's attorney Michael Cohen authorized negotiations to begin, then during those negotiations, ""Michael was very agitated,"" constantly asking ""Why is this taking so long?"" ""To purchase the lifetime rights to Karen McDougal was going to cost $150,000. Plus Karen wanted to restart her career. She wanted to write for the celebrity magazines. She wanted to be on the cover of the life and fitness titles. She had a major problem when her breast implants were removed and she wanted to write about that,"" Pecker testified. Pecker said he asked Cohen, ""Who is going to reimburse me for this?"" He said Cohen responded ""Don't worry about it, I'm your friend the boss will take care of it.'"" When prosecutor Josh Steinglass asked Pecker who ""the boss"" was, Pecker answered ""The boss would have been Donald Trump"" Prosecutors then displayed for the jury the contract with McDougal, dated August 5, 2016. It awarded AMI, the Enquirer's parent company, the rights to her story of a relationship she had ""with any then-married man."" Pecker said ""she was referring to Donald Trump."" Pecker testified he needed to ""validate"" the amount of money AMI was going to pay, so the contract included other provisions, like having McDougal write monthly columns on aging and fitness. ""With respect to campaign laws, I wanted to have the contract be a record that stipulates the services she was going to perform for American Media had a basis for it, the $150,000,"" Pecker said. ""Was it your primary purpose to buy the life rights?"" Steinglass asked. ""Yes it was,"" Pecker responded. ""Were the other provisions to disguise the true nature of this contract?"" Steinglass asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker replied, letting out a sigh. Apr 25, 10:18 AMCohen said Trump would pay to buy McDougal story, Pecker says In June of 2016, as the National Enquirer evaluated the merits of Karen McDougal's claim of a year-long affair with Trump, Trump's attorney Michael Cohen instructed Pecker to purchase her story -- and suggested that Trump would compensate the company for the cost, according to Pecker. Pecker recalled from the stand a conversation he had with Cohen, in which Cohen told him, ""You should go ahead and buy this story."" ""So I said to him … 'Who's going to pay for it?'' Pecker testified, saying Cohen replied, ""'Don't worry, I'm your friend, the boss will take care of it.'"" Pecker said he interpreted that to mean that if the National Enquirer purchased the story, Trump or the Trump Organization would reimburse him. Picking up on his testimony from Tuesday, Pecker said that when he spoke with Trump about McDougal's story, he recalled that Trump called McDougal ""a nice girl"" and asked Pecker what he should do about it. ""I think you should buy this story and take it off the market,"" Pecker said, explaining that he ""believed the story was true. I think that it would be embarrassing to himself and also to his campaign."" During her negotiations with the National Enquirer, McDougal represented that ""she didn't want to be the next Monica Lewinsky,"" Pecker said. Apr 25, 10:04 AMPecker resumes testimony about Karen McDougal Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker has resumed his testimony. The veteran tabloid executive is fielding questions from prosecutors about how his publication handled its initial interactions with Karen McDougal, who approached the National Enquirer with allegations that she had had a year-long sexual relationship with Donald Trump. When one of his reporters met with McDougal, the reporter found that her allegations “could be true, but she didn’t have any corroborating evidence,"" Pecker said. Apr 25, 9:57 AMProsecutors say Trump violated gag order four more times Prosecutors have asked Judge Juan Merchan to hold Donald Trump in contempt for four additional violations of the court's limited gag order over the last three days. ""He is doing what the order tells him not to do,"" prosecutor Christopher Conroy said about Trump's recent remarks about witnesses and the jury. Conroy outlined the four alleged violations, including Trump's hallway statements about Cohen on Monday, an interview Trump did on Monday where he made comments about the political composition of the jury pool, Trump's interview with Philadelphia ABC station WPVI-TV where he attacked Cohen, and Trump's remarks this morning at a construction site where he commented on David Pecker's testimony. ""This is a message to Pecker -- be nice. It is a message to others. I have a platform and I will talk about you,"" Conroy said. ""It is a message to everyone involved in this proceeding and this court."" Conroy did not specify what penalty Merchan should impose. In total, prosecutors have asked to hold Trump in 14 counts of criminal contempt. Apr 25, 9:42 AMCourt is in session Court is underway this morning for Day 7 of Donald Trump's hush money trial. Trump entered the courtroom and took his usual seat at the defense table. He then whispered something to his attorney Todd Blanche, who let out a laugh. Judge Juan Merchan gaveled in the hearing and said, ""Good Morning, Mr. Trump."" Trump didn't appear to respond. Apr 25, 7:17 AMTrump again complains about not being allowed to go to the Supreme Court hearing on presidential immunity Donald Trump arrived at a New York City construction site early Thursday morning and was greeted by several dozen supporters before speaking to the media and complaining that he was not allowed to go to the Supreme Court hearing in Washington, D.C., later in the day. “We have a big case today – this judge wouldn’t allow me to go, but we have a big case today at the Supreme Court on presidential immunity, a president has to have immunity. If you don't have immunity, you just have a ceremonial president,"" said Trump. Trump also expressed confidence in the outcome of the hearing, saying that the Supreme Court has “very talented people, they’re very smart, they know what they’re doing.” Apr 24, 5:17 PMMichael Cohen says he'll stop commenting about Trump Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen vowed to stop making public comments about the former president ahead of his likely testimony in Trump's New York hush money case. On his podcast and on social media, Cohen has frequently commented about the former president's legal troubles. Trump's lawyers have argued that the former president's comments about Cohen -- which prosecutors allege were in violation of the case's limited gag order -- were in response to political attacks by Cohen. ""Despite not being the gagged defendant, out of respect for Judge Merchan and the prosecutors, I will cease posting anything about Donald on my X (formerly Twitter) account or on the Mea Culpa Podcast until after my trial testimony. See you all in a month (or more),"" Cohen said on social media on Wednesday afternoon. Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche devoted a portion of his opening statement on Monday to attacking Cohen's credibility, describing the former lawyer as a ""convicted perjurer"" and ""admitted liar"" who has an ""obsession with getting Trump."" Cohen's testimony is expected to be a key part of the state's case against Trump, as prosecutors attempt to prove that Trump falsified business records as he, Cohen and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by suppressing negative stories about Trump. Apr 23, 2:34 PMTrump again assails judge for limited gag order Former President Trump, addressing reporters after court was adjourned for the day, angrily criticized Judge Merchan and the limited gag order that was the topic of this morning's contempt hearing. ""We have a gag order, which to me is totally unconstitutional. I'm not allowed to talk but people are allowed to talk about me,"" Trump said. ""So, they can talk about me, they can say whatever they want, they can lie. But I'm not allowed to say that. I just have to sit back and look at why a conflicted judge has ordered for me to have a gag order. I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like this."" Shuffling through a thick stack of papers, which Trump said were news articles from the past day and a half, the former president continued his criticism. ""So, I put an article on it and then somebody's name is mentioned somewhere deep in the article and I ended up in violation of the gag order,"" he said. ""I think it's a disgrace. It's totally unconstitutional."" Prosecutors this morning asked the judge to fine Trump $10,000 for what the say are 10 recent violations of the limited gag order, which prohibits Trump from making statements about witnesses, jurors, and lawyers in the case other than Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. The judge has yet to issue a ruling. -Michael Pappano Apr 23, 2:16 PMPecker testifies about Karen McDougal before court ends for day ""Karen McDougal was a Playboy model,"" former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker said, recalling how he learned in June 2016 ""that there's a Playboy model who is trying to sell a story about a relationship that she had with Donald Trump for a year."" Pecker said he immediately called Trump's then-attorney Michael Cohen to inform him. By then, he was speaking to Cohen ""a couple times a week,"" but that soon changed. Pecker said he and Cohen spoke ""much more frequently"" about McDougal's claims. ""Michael was very agitated. It looked like he was getting a lot of pressure to get the answer right away,"" Pecker said. ""He kept on calling, and each time he called he seemed more anxious."" Pecker said he assumed ""Mr. Trump was asking Michael Cohen, 'Did we hear anything yet?'"" Pecker said. ""Did you ever come to believe that Michael Cohen had spoken with Mr. Trump about McDougal's claims?"" prosecutor Josh Steinglass asked. ""Yes I did,"" Pecker responded before recounting a phone conversation Pecker said he himself had with Trump. ""I said I think the story should be purchased and we should buy it,"" Pecker recalled telling Trump. ""Mr. Trump said to me, 'I don't buy stories. Anytime you do anything like this, it always gets out.'"" Ultimately, McDougal was paid $150,000 and promised a series of exercise articles in the publication. Following that testimony, court was adjourned. It's expected the jury will hear more on McDougal upon Pecker's return to the witness stand, when court resumes on Thursday. Apr 23, 2:05 PMPecker kept doorman under contract until after election According to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, Michael Cohen pushed for the National Enquirer to keep doorman Dino Sajudin locked into a contract until after the 2016 election, even though the story Sajudin was shopping about Trump having a love child were untrue. ""I told Michael Cohen the story was not true. I told him that the doorman is very difficult to deal with,"" Pecker testified. Cohen had earlier encouraged Pecker to add a $1 million penalty to Sajudin's contract if he broke the agreement and tried to shop around the story. ""He would breach this agreement and owe American Media a million dollars,"" Pecker said. ""It was basically a lever over him to make sure that wouldn't happen."" Cohen encouraged Pecker to keep Sajudin locked in, according to the former publisher. ""I am going release him one way or the other,"" Pecker said he told Cohen regarding Sajudin. ""He said, 'No, release him after the election.'"" ""When was he released?"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked Pecker. ""December 9, 2016,"" Pecker said. ""After the presidential election?"" Steinglass asked. ""Yes,"" Pecker responded. Apr 23, 1:48 PMPecker details catch-and-kill deal with Trump Tower doorman Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker described the very first story he ""caught and killed"" pursuant to his agreement with Donald Trump and his then-attorney Michael Cohen: a false story from a Trump Tower doorman in 2015. Trump, sitting at the defense table, shook his head when Pecker laid out the allegation: that ""Donald Trump fathered an illegitimate girl with a maid at Trump Tower."" Pecker testified that he ""immediately called Michael Cohen"" when his team got wind of those allegations being shopped by the doorman, Dino Sajudin. Cohen told him it was ""absolutely not true"" -- but Pecker testified he ultimately moved forward with buying the story to the tune of $30,000. ""This could be a very big story. I believe that it's important that it should be removed from the market,"" Pecker said he told Cohen. Asked about Cohen's response, Pecker said: ""He said the boss would be very pleased,"" saying he understood ""the boss"" to mean Donald Trump. Pecker testified that Cohen later called back to say the story is ""absolutely not true"" and that Trump ""would take a DNA test"" -- an apparently new revelation -- but Pecker said it wouldn't be necessary. Pecker conceded that if the story turned out to be true, it ""probably would be the biggest sale"" for the paper since the death of Elvis Presley. Still, Pecker testified he would have held it until after the campaign was over. ""I would have published it after the election,"" Pecker said. ""That was the conversation I had with Michael Cohen, and that's what we agreed to."" Ultimately, the story turned out to be untrue -- but Pecker still paid for it. ""Why are you paying $30,000 for an untrue story?"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked while displaying the contract Pecker had with Sajudan to the jury. ""Because if the story got out to another publication, it would have been embarrassing for the campaign,"" Pecker said. ""So this was a way to lock it up?"" Steinglass asked. ""That's correct,"" Pecker responded. Apr 23, 12:57 PMPecker testifies that he strategized with Steve Bannon Donald Trump introduced David Pecker to Steve Bannon to strategize future stories about Trump's opponents, the former National Enquirer publisher testified. ""[Trump] thought both of us could work very well together,"" Pecker said of Bannon, who would go on to become chief strategist in the Trump White House. Pecker said Bannon liked some of the National Enquirer's past coverage and had ideas for the future. ""He liked them very much. He had some other ideas,"" Pecker said, mentioning a proposed plan to book one of Pecker's reporters on Sean Hannity's Fox News show to talk about the National Enquirer's reporting about Hillary Clinton. Apr 23, 12:40 PMPlan to boost Trump was hatched in 2015, Pecker says Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's ""secret arrangement"" with Donald Trump and his then-attorney Michael Cohen was hatched during a ""20-25 minute meeting"" at Trump Tower in August of 2015, Pecker testified. Under the arrangement, the National Enquirer would become a trumpet for Trump's presidential ambition and a megaphone for Michael Cohen's opposition research on Trump's opponents, he said. ""He would send me information about Ted Cruz or Ben Carson or Marco Rubio, and that was the basis for our story, and we would embellish,"" Pecker testified. He said that he kept the arrangement from all but his top people. ""I told them we were going to try and help the campaign, and to do that we would keep it as quiet as possible,"" Pecker recalled telling his East and West Coast bureau chiefs. Prosecutors showed the jury a collection of Enquirer headlines that lauded Trump and disparaged his opponents. ""Bungling Surgeon Ben Carson Left Sponge in Patient's Brain,"" one article said. ""Donald Trump blasts Ted Cruz's Dad for Photo with JFK Assassin,"" said another, recounting classic fare from the 2016 campaign. ""After the Republican debates and based on the success that some of the other candidates had, I would receive a call from Michael Cohen and he would direct me and direct Dylan Howard which candidate and which direction we should go,"" Pecker said, referring to the National Enquirer.s chief content officer. Apr 23, 12:24 PMPecker says he didn't catch-and-kill any Trump stories before 2016 Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that he suspected that multiple women would come forward to shop stories about Trump during Trump's run for president. ""In a presidential campaign, I was the person that thought there would be a lot of women who came out to sell their stories because Mr. Trump was well known as the most eligible bachelor and dated the most beautiful woman,"" Pecker testified. ""It is very common for these women to call up a magazine like the National Enquirer to try and sell their stories. I would hear it in the marketplace through other sources that stories were being marketed."" If those stories emerged, Pecker said he vowed that he would notify Michael Cohen, Trump's then-personal attorney, per their agreement. According to Pecker, most elements of their agreement -- including running positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents -- were ""mutually beneficial"" to Trump and Pecker. ""Hillary running for president and Bill Clinton's womanizing was one of the biggest sales ... for the National Enquirer,"" Pecker said. "" It was easy for me to say I was going to continue running those kinds of stories for the National Enquirer."" ""It would help his campaign, but it would also help me,"" Pecker said. ""As I recollect, [Trump] was pleased. Michael Cohen was pleased [about] the way I was going to handle these issues,"" Pecker said. Pecker said that prior to the 2016 election, his magazines never caught and killed any stories for Trump. When pressed by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass, Pecker acknowledged that the catch-and-kill element of the agreement -- buying negative information about Trump then killing the story -- was not beneficial for the National Enquirer. ""How was that going to boost sales of the National Enquirer?"" Steinglass asked. ""No, that part didn't help,"" Pecker said. Apr 23, 11:57 AMPecker says he was in regular contact with Cohen Despite first meeting Michael Cohen by chance in 2000 at a bar mitzvah, former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that Donald Trump first introduced him to Cohen as his personal lawyer in 2007. Pecker said Trump asked him to begin coordinating with Cohen about any stories or rumors related to Trump or his family. ""All of the contacts that I had with Mr. Trump -- now my contact should go through Michael Cohen,"" Pecker said about Trump's directive after meeting Cohen. Pecker and Cohen would touch base monthly over the following decade, but communications ramped up after Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015, Pecker said. ""I would say a minimum of every week, and if there was an issue, it could be daily,"" Pecker said about his contact with Cohen during the campaign. Apr 23, 11:52 AMPecker describes 'great relationship' with Trump Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, back on the witness stand, pointed at Donald Trump and flashed a smile when he was asked to identify the defendant. Trump turned his chin up and grinned at his longtime friend. ""I met Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago,"" Pecker said. ""I've had a great relationship with Mr. Trump over the years."" That relationship started in 1989 when Pecker wanted to start a magazine called Trump Style. ""He was very helpful in introducing me to other executives in New York. He would always advise me of parties or events that I would go to,"" Pecker said, adding that Trump was among the first to congratulate him upon acquiring the National Enquirer. Pecker described how Trump became a ""major celebrity"" after launching The Apprentice and later Celebrity Apprentice, and how the National Enquirer was there to juice Trump's profile. ""He was always kind enough to send me the content showing the ratings and I was able to publish that,"" Pecker said of their ""great mutual beneficially relationship. Pecker said he considered Trump a friend from 2015 to 2017, calling him by the familiar ""Donald,"" as he pursued the White House for the first time. ""After he announced his run for the presidency I saw Mr. Trump more frequently, maybe once a month,"" Pecker said. The two spoke ""maybe once every couple of weeks."" Pecker recalled meeting Trump in his office when his assistant brought a batch of invoices and checks to sign. ""As I recollect the entire package was stapled together,"" Pecker said. ""So you observed him reviewing an invoice and signing a check?"" prosecutor Josh Steinglass asked. ""That's correct,"" Pecker responded. ""I would describe him as very knowledgeable, very detail-oriented, almost as a micromanager,"" Pecker said. When Steinglass asked how Trump was with money, Pecker responded, ""He was very cautious and very frugal."" Apr 23, 11:43 AMSecret Service has plans if Trump is confined for contempt: Sources The U.S. Secret Service has held meetings and started planning for what to do if former President Trump were to be held in contempt and Judge Juan Merchan opted to send him to short-term confinement, officials familiar with the situation tell ABC News. Prosecutors said at this point they are seeking a fine. ""We are not yet seeking an incarceratory penalty,"" assistant district attorney Chris Conroy said, ""But the defendant seems to be angling for that."" Officials do not necessarily believe Merchan would put Trump in a holding cell in the courthouse but they are planning for contingencies, the officials said. There have be no discussion about what to do if Trump is convicted and sentenced to prison, they said. ""Under federal law, the United States Secret Service must provide protection for current government leaders, former Presidents and First Ladies, visiting heads of state and other individuals designated by the President of the United States,"" the Secret Service said in an official statement. ""For all settings around the world, we study locations and develop comprehensive and layered protective models that incorporate state of the art technology, protective intelligence and advanced security tactics to safeguard our protectees. Beyond that, we do not comment on specific protective operations."" -Josh Margolin and Luke Barr Apr 23, 10:56 AMContempt hearing ends without a ruling The combative hearing on Trump's alleged violations of the judge's limited gag order ended with the judge saying he will not rule from bench on the district attorney's motion to hold Trump in contempt, so a ruling will come later. Before concluding the hearing, Judge Merchan told Trump attorney Todd Blanche, ""You're not offering me anything … to hang my hat on."" The trial will resume shortly with the return of former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker to the witness stand. Apr 23, 10:48 AM'You’re losing all credibility,' judge admonishes defense Judge Juan Merchan is visibly irritated with the lack of evidence presented by defense attorney Todd Blanche. “You have presented nothing,” Merchan said. “I have asked eight or nine times; show me the exact post he was responding to.” “You’re losing all credibility with the court,” Merchan said after Blanche suggested Trump has been careful to comply with the gag order. Blanche attempted to represent that Trump did not intend to violate the gag order, but Merchan did not appear satisfied by the response. “Are you testifying under oath that this is his position?” Merchan asked. “Do you want me to put him on the stand?” Blanche asked, though Trump did not take the stand. Merchan strongly reacted earlier when Blanche suggested there were two tiers of justice in the courtroom. “There are two systems of justice. Mr. Weisselberg is in prison, and Mr. Cohen is a witness,"" Blanche said, in reference to the former Trump Organization CFO who was sentenced to jail time for perjury. “There are two systems of justice in this courtroom -- is that what you are saying?” Merchan responded. Apr 23, 10:41 AM'It's just common sense,' defense argues regarding Trump's posts The contempt hearing has turned tense as Trump attorney Todd Blanche tries to defend Trump's posts as mere responses to attacks -- but isn't giving clear examples of how Trump was being attacked. Instead, Blanche asked the judge why the timing of the posts mattered -- prompting a strong rebuke from the judge. ""I'm asking the questions, OK?"" Judge Merchan told Blanche. ""Please don't turn it around."" Merchan continued to reprimand Blanche: ""I'm asking a specific question over and over and I'm not getting an answer."" Merchan then lamented that nearly an hour into the hearing they are still only up to reviewing post NO. 2 of 10, and the jury is set to arrive at 11 a.m. ET to resume trial proceedings. ""The people got to speak as long as they want to,"" Blanche said regarding the prosecutors. ""The people were answering my questions,"" Merchan retorted. So far, Merchan has appeared skeptical of what Blanche has been arguing in defense of the posts. Blanche at times has been struggling to answer Merchan's questions, at one point saying, ""I don't have any case law to support that. It's just common sense."" Apr 23, 10:31 AMProsecutors warn about seeking potential jail time Donald Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche, during the contempt hearing on the limited gag order in the case, defended the former president's comments by arguing that Trump was responding to political attacks. ""President Trump does in fact know what the gag order allows him to do and not allow him to do,"" Blanche said. ""There is no dispute that President Trump is facing a barrage of political attacks from all sides."" According to Blanche, while the limited gag order prohibits statements about a witness' potential participation in a case, Trump is allowed to make comments in response to political attacks from potential witnesses like Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels. ""They are talking about their very strong dislike of President Trump,"" Blanche said about a post related to former Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti's comments on Michael Cohen. Judge Juan Merchan questioned Blanche about what exactly made Trump's response ""political"" in nature. ""You believe that everything Mr. Avenatti said does not relate to the trial, but the use of the word 'pardon' makes it political and in a sense authorizes your client to respond?"" Merchan asked. ""It's everything. It can't just be a single word,"" Blanche responded. ""When your client is violating the gag, I expect more than one word,"" Merchan said. Conroy asked Merchan to advise Trump that for future violations of the gag order, “incarceration is an option should it be necessary.” Apr 23, 10:08 AMTrump's remarks 'pose a very real threat,' prosecutors say Donald Trump's alleged violations of the court-imposed limited gag order ""pose a very real threat to the integrity of the judicial proceedings,"" prosecutor Christopher Conroy said during the hearing on whether Trump should be held in contempt. In addition to the ten alleged gag order violations, Conroy said the district attorney's office would file an additional contempt motion later today about comments Trump made to cameras on Monday about Michael Cohen. Among Trump's comments: ""Because as you know, Cohen is a lawyer -- represented a lot of people over the years -- now, I'm not the only one. And he wasn't very good in a lot of ways, in terms of his representation, but he represented a lot of people."" ""And also, the things he got in trouble for were things that had nothing to do with me. He got in trouble and went to jail. This had nothing to do with me. This had to do with the taxi-cab company that he owned, which is something -- and medallions and borrow money and a lot of things but had nothing to do with me. He represented a lot of people over the years."" ""And when are they going to look at all the lies that Cohen -- did -- in the last straw he got caught lying in the last trial. So he got caught lying -- pure lying. And when are they going to look at that?"" Conroy told the judge that Trump has ""violated this order repeatedly and hasn't stopped."" Conroy said Trump's conduct is ""all part of his plan for this trial,"" accusing the former president of ""conditioning his followers"" by making derogatory remarks about potential witnesses. Apr 23, 9:59 AMTrump falsely claims his supporters can't protest On his way into the courtroom, Trump continued to falsely claim that his supporters were being barred from protesting outside the courthouse. “Great Americans -- people that want to come down and they want to protest at the court. And they want to protest peacefully,” he told reporters. “We have more police presence here than anyone's ever seen for blocks. You can't get near this courthouse.” But as the day's proceedings began, the park across from the New York criminal courthouse was open and nearly empty, and the area around the courthouse is not closed off. -Mike Pappano and Brian Hartman Apr 23, 9:37 AMTrump arrives in court Donald Trump has arrived in court with his usual entourage of lawyers, staff, and secret service agents. Trump promptly took his seat alone at the counsel table as his lawyers and paralegals worked around him set up electronics for this morning's contempt hearing, in which prosecutors will seek to have Trump held in contempt of court for repeatedly violating the case's limited gag order. Three prosecutors -- Joshua Steinglass, Christopher Conroy, and Matthew Colangelo -- are seated at the counsel table, with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and about eight members of his office seated in the first two rows of the gallery. Bragg appears to have two security agents seated behind him, while a dozen court officers and secret service agents surround the courtroom and former president. Apr 23, 8:20 AMDay 6 of trial to start with contempt hearing Day 6 of Donald Trump's criminal trial will begin with a hearing in front of Judge Juan Merchan in which prosecutors will seek to have the former president held in contempt for repeatedly violating the limited gag order in the case. Prosecutors have argued that Trump violated the limited gag order -- which prohibits statements about witnesses, jurors, and lawyers in the case other than Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg -- on at least 10 separate occasions this month, and have asked the judge to hold him in contempt of court and fine him $10,000. Trump's lawyers have argued that prosecutors have not proven the posts in question were willful violations of the gag order, telling Merchan that the former president was defending himself from attacks by the likely witnesses. Following the hearing, testimony in the hush money trial is scheduled to resume with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker on the stand. Prosecutors believe he is key to understanding Trump’s motivation for paying off Stormy Daniels so damaging information did not seep into the 2016 campaign. Apr 22, 1:28 PMTrump, after court, says payments were correctly labeled Moments after his criminal trial adjourned for the day, Donald Trump exited the courtroom and told reporters that his payments to Michael Cohen were appropriately labeled as legal expenses. ""Actually, nobody's been able to say what you're supposed to call it,"" Trump told the media. ""If the lawyer puts in a bill or an invoice and you pay the bill ... that's a very small little line ... it's not like you could tell a life story."" ""They marked it down for a legal expense. This is what I got indicted over,"" Trump said. The former president also attempted to paint his former attorney Michael Cohen as an unreliable witness and said he ""wasn't very good in a lot of ways"" as an attorney. Trump's motorcade then departed the courthouse. -Michael Pappano Apr 22, 12:52 PMCourt wraps for day, Pecker to return tomorrow David Pecker stepped off the witness stand after his initial testimony. He is scheduled to return to the witness stand tomorrow at 11 a.m. ET. During his brief testimony, Pecker suggested that former National Enquirer Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard -- an alleged participant in the catch-and-kill scheme alleged by prosecutors -- will be unable to testify due to a medical condition. Pecker appeared to greet Trump and his lawyers as he exited the courtroom. Court subsequently wrapped for the day. Trump left the courtroom flanked by Secret Service agents and staffers, as well as Trump Organization General Counsel Alan Garten. Judge Merchan is scheduled to hold a contempt hearing about Trump’s alleged violations of the case’s limited gag order tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. ET. Apr 22, 12:27 PMDavid Pecker takes the stand for prosecution David Pecker, who once called Donald Trump ""a personal friend of mine,"" flashed a big smile as he took the stand as the trial's first witness, belying the gravity of the moment. Pecker cackled loudly into the microphone, jolting the room, when prosecutor Josh Steinglass, asked him about his various phone numbers that he struggled to remember. Pecker, 72, was the publisher of the National Enquirer but prosecutors said he was ""acting as a co-conspirator"" in helping buy and bury damaging stories about Trump, including a doorman's false claim that Trump had fathered a love child and a Playboy model's claim of a sexual relationship with Trump, who has denied both allegations. Trump, who once said Pecker would make a ""brilliant"" choice as editor of Time magazine, listened while leaning forward in his chair, arms crossed on the table, an unhappy look on his face. Pecker testified that he had final say whether to publish any story involving a famous person. ""I had the final say of the celebrity side of the magazine,"" Pecker said. ""We used checkbook journalism. We paid for stories."" Pecker is testifying pursuant to a subpoena. He has also secured a non-prosecution agreement with the Manhattan district attorney's office. Apr 22, 12:10 PMProsecutors call David Pecker as 1st witness Prosecutors have called former American Media Inc. executive David Pecker as their first witness. The DA alleges that Pecker, who oversaw the National Enquirer, engaged in a conspiracy with Trump to help influence the 2016 election by killing negative stories about Trump. Apr 22, 11:50 AMMichael Cohen obsessed with 'getting Trump,' defense claims In his opening statement, defense attorney Todd Blanche sought to eviscerate Michael Cohen's credibility, saying Cohen is obsessed with Donald Trump, has a desire to see Trump incarcerated and has a propensity to lie. ""He has a goal, an obsession, with getting Trump. I submit to you he cannot be trusted,"" Blanche said. On Sunday night, Cohen publicly posted online that he had a ""mental excitement about this trial"" and the testimony he would deliver, Blanche said. ""His entire financial livelihood depends on President Trump's destruction,"" Blanche said. ""You cannot make a serious decision about President Trump by relying on the words of Michael Cohen. Apr 22, 11:47 AMTrump had 'nothing to do,' with invoices, defense says ""I have a spoiler alert,"" defense attorney Todd Blanche told jurors during his opening statement. ""There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy."" Amid frequent objections from prosecutors, Blanche argued that the Manhattan district attorney has attempted to make the payments and non-disclosure agreements between Trump and Stormy Daniels ""sinister"" to the jury. Judge Merchan had to interrupt Blanche's opening after multiple objections from prosecutors, then he met the parties at a sidebar conference, after which he struck a line from Blanche's opening. ""There is nothing illegal about entering into a non-disclosure agreement. Period,"" Blanche restated after the portion of his opening was struck from the record. Blanche's opening has come off more casual and off-the-cuff than the state's opening, with Blanche improvising and posing hypotheticals to argue that accountants at the Trump Organization did not run the invoices by Trump as he was ""running the country."" ""'Hey, we got this invoice. I know we are trying to cover it up here,'"" Blanche said sarcastically about how prosecutors described how accountants received invoices from Cohen. ""Absolutely not."" According to Blanche, Trump was unaware of how the invoices were processed by his employees. ""President Trump has nothing to do -- nothing to do -- with the invoice, with the check being generated, or with the entry on the ledger,"" Blanche said, arguing that Trump was busy ""in the White House while he was running the country."" ""The reality is that President Trump is not on the hook -- criminally responsible -- for something Michael Cohen might have done years after the fact. The evidence will prove otherwise,"" Blanche said. Apr 22, 11:38 AM'None of this was a crime,' defense attorney says Donald Trump is ""not just our former president, he's not just Donald Trump that you've seen on TV,"" said defense attorney Todd Blanche in his opening statement. ""He's also a man. He's a husband,"" Blanche said. ""He's a father."" Blanche pushed back on the DA's overall allegation that the payments to Trump's attorney Michael Cohen were weren't only payback for Stormy Daniels by using the prosecutor's own words against him. Blanche noted that Cohen paid $130,000 to Daniels, but that Trump paid back Cohen a total of $420,000. If Trump really was a frugal businessman, as prosecutors said, why would he overpay that money, Blanche asked. ""Ask yourself, would a frugal businessman, a man who pinched his pennies, repay a $130,000 debt to the tune of $420,000?"" Blanche asked. Blanche repeatedly reiterated that Cohen truly was an attorney for Trump and was doing legal work for him, pointing out that Michael Cohen's own email signature noted he was Trump's attorney. ""None of this was a crime,"" Blanche said, saying the 34 counts against Trump ""are really just 34 pieces of paper."" Apr 22, 11:30 AMTrump 'did not commit any crimes,' defense tells jury ""President Trump is innocent. President Trump did not commit any crimes,"" defense attorney Todd Blanche said to begin the defense's opening statements. ""The Manhattan district attorney's office should never have brought this case,"" Blanche said. ""You will hear me and others refer to him as President Trump. That is a title he has earned because he was our 45th President,"" Blanche added. Apr 22, 11:26 AMProsecutor says jury can believe Cohen despite mistakes Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told the jury, during his opening statement, ""During this trial you're going to hear a lot about Michael Cohen.” Trump's former personal attorney, Cohen is a key witness -- perhaps the only one that will testify to Donald Trump’s intent when he agreed to pay Stormy Daniels hush money. The defense “will go to great lengths” to convince the jury Cohen is not credible, Colangelo said. He acknowledged that Cohen had earlier lied regarding the matter. “He lied about it to protect his boss,” Colangelo said. “You will also learn that Michael Cohen has a criminal record.” Colangelo told jurors they can believe Cohen despite his past mistakes. “Cohen's testimony will be backed up by testimony from other witnesses you will hear from, including David Pecker, Keith Davidson. It will be backed up by an extensive paper trail. And it will be backed up by Donald Trump’s own words,” the prosecutor said. Colangelo concluded by saying, “This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up, an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election and then the steps that Donald Trump took to conceal that election fraud. At the end of the case we are confident you will have no reasonable doubt that Donald Trump is guilty of falsifying business records.” Apr 22, 11:16 AM'It was election fraud, pure and simple,' prosecutor says ""It was election fraud, pure and simple,"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told the jury during opening statements as he outlined the hush payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and how it was logged by the Trump Organization Dylan Howard, then editor of the National Enquirer, had called Trump attorney Michael Cohen to inform him about Daniels and the story that she had of a sexual liaison with Trump, which the former president has long denied. ""Cohen then discussed the situation with Trump who is adamant that he did not want the story to come out,"" Colangelo said. ""it could have been devastating to his campaign."" At the time, Trump and the campaign were ""deeply concerned"" about the ""Access Hollywood"" video, the prosecutor said. Cohen wired the $130,000 to Daniels' lawyer to keep her quiet. ""Cohen made that payment at Donald Trump's direction and for his benefit and he did it with the special goal of influencing the electionThis was not spin or communications strategy. This was a planned, coordinated long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election to help DT get elected through illegal expenditures to silence people who had something bad about his behavior. It was election fraud, pure and simple,"" Colangelo said. Apr 22, 11:10 AM'Access Hollywood' tape was 'explosive,' prosecutors claim Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo read aloud part of the transcript of the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape to jurors. ""You can do anything,"" Colangelo slowly read to the jurors, quoting Trump from the tape. ""Grab them by the p----. You can do anything."" According to Colangelo, the October 2016 release of the tape had an ""immediate and explosive"" impact on Donald Trump's presidential campaign. ""Seeing and hearing a candidate in his own words, in his own voice, with his own body language ... has a much greater impact on voters than words on paper,"" Colangelo said. ""The campaign went on immediate damage control mode to blunt the impact of the tape."" The campaign was concerned about the impact it might have on Trump voters or even the possibility that Trump could lose the Republican nomination one month out from the election, according to Colangelo. ""The Republican National Committee even considered whether it was too late to replace their own nominee,"" Colangelo said. Apr 22, 11:04 AMTrump, listening to openings, shakes his head Former President Trump, sitting at the defense table, softly shook his head ""no"" when prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told the jurors that Trump formed a ""conspiracy"" with Michael Cohen and David Pecker to ""help him get elected."" It was one of the most notable reactions from Trump as he sits and listens to prosecutors lay out their story of the case. Colangelo then brought up the ""Access Hollywood"" tape and said it showed Trump ""bragging about sexual assault,"" Trump shook his head no again, pursing his lips. He did not react when Colangelo, quoting Trump on the tape, said, ""grab them by the p----."" Earlier, as Colangelo brought up a former Trump doorman who was he said was paid off as part of the alleged catch-and-kill scheme, Trump -- looking annoyed -- leaned over and tapped his lawyer Todd Blanche. When Colangelo said the doorman was paid $30,000 to bury his story, Trump raised his eyebrows and grabbed onto a pen. The former president has been passing notes and sliding papers between Blanche and attorney Emil Bove, and leaning side-to-side, whispering to them. Blanche at one point pulled out his own sticky note and slid a note back to Trump. At other times he has hardly seemed engaged at all, slumping in his red leather chair looking straight forward with no facial expression, or fidgeting with his head tilting back and forth. At one point during jury instructions he let out a yawn. Apr 22, 10:48 AMProsecutor alleges 3-prong conspiracy ""It starts with that August 2015 meeting in Trump Tower,"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors about the alleged conspiracy, in his opening statement. Following a meeting between Donald Trump, his then-lawyer Michael Cohen, and AMI executive David Pecker, the three engaged in a three-prong conspiracy to help influence the 2016 election, according to Colangelo. First, the National Enquirer would run ""headline after headline that extolled the defendant's virtues,"" according to Colangelo. ""Pecker had the ultimate say over publication decisions,"" Colangelo said, adding that Trump edited, killed, and suggested the cover of the magazine. Second, the National Enquirer would run negative stories attacking Trump's opponents in the 2016 Republican primary, such as attacks on Ben Caron or Marco Rubio. Third, the ""core of the conspiracy"" was killing negative stories about Trump -- evolving into the catch-and kill scheme, Colangelo said. ""The National Enquirer ran these stories as part of the conspiracy launched after the Trump Tower meeting,"" he said. Apr 22, 10:40 AM'This case is about a criminal conspiracy,' prosecutor says ""This case is about a criminal conspiracy,"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo began his opening statement in Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York. ""The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,"" the prosecutor said. The utterance represents the first time a prosecutor has sought to implicate a former president in a crime at his trial. Colangelo said Trump schemed with his attorney Michael Cohen and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker ""to influence the presidential election by concealing negative information about former President Trump."" Trump slouched in his seat the defense table, listening. ""The defendant said in his business records that he was paying Cohen for legal services pursuant to a retainer agreement. But those were lies,"" Colangelo said. ""The defendant was paying him back for an illegal payment to Stormy Daniels on the eve of the election."" Apr 22, 10:21 AMTrump is 'presumed to be innocent,' judge tells jury Donald Trump faced forward and did not appear to make eye contact with any jurors as they entered the courtroom and took their seats in the jury box. Before any of the lawyers in the case could speak a word, Judge Merchan launched into a lengthy speech outlining how the trial will work. “We are about to begin the trial of People of the State of New York v. Donald Trump,” Merchan told the 12 jurors and six alternates. Merchan emphasized that the burden of proof rests on the prosecutors and that jurors should presume that Trump is innocent. A guilty verdict requires that each juror determines that the state proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt, Merchan said. “The defendant is presumed to be innocent,” Merchan said. “It is not sufficient to prove that the defendant is probably guilty.” Merchan attempted to set expectations for the jurors, only two of which have ever served on a jury before. For example, Merchan told the jurors not to expect the lawyers to launch into lengthy speeches outside of the opening and closing statements. “That happens in TV and in movies, but it doesn’t happen in real trials,” Merchan said. Apr 22, 10:09 AMJudge issues mixed ruling on cross-examination of Trump Judge Juan Merchan ruled that if Trump takes the stand, prosecutors can question him about a number of previous legal issues -- but the judge limited the scope of the cases and the extent to which prosecutors can question him about the facts of those cases. The ruling is a mixed bag for Trump, who had sought to entirely block questioning on these previous issues if he takes the stand. Judge Merchan ruled that Trump can be questioned by the DA's office on six determinations from four previous proceedings, including aspects of his New York civil fraud case and the gag order violations there, as well as both E. Jean Carrol verdicts and the Trump foundation case. Prosecutors had originally asked to question Trump about six different proceedings with 13 total determinations. Merchan said with his ruling, he has ""greatly curtailed"" how much prosecutors can discuss the underlying facts of those cases. ""The court cautions the defendant that this Sandoval ruling is a shield, not a sword,"" Merchan said. Apr 22, 9:59 AMSchedule set for today's proceedings Prosecutors told Judge Merchan that they need 40 minutes for their opening statements. Defense attorneys told the judge they need 25 minutes. The judge also announced that court will break at 12:30 p.m. ET today, after a juror had a toothache and got an emergency appointment this afternoon. Court had already been scheduled to end early today, at 2 p.m. ET, due to the Passover holiday. Apr 22, 9:52 AMIssue with Juror No. 9 is resolved Judge Juan Merchan announced there is an issue with Juror No. 9 -- who, according to Merchan, ""was concerned about media attention"" of the case. According to Merchan, the juror ""wasn't 100% sure"" they could serve. Merchan said they would speak to the juror in chambers to ""find out what the issue is and see if this juror can continue to serve."" After a brief sidebar, the judge announced: “Juror No. 9 is going to remain with us.” There are six alternate jurors seated in case any of the 12 jurors cannot serve. Apr 22, 9:44 AMTrump tells reporters it's a 'sad day in America' On his way into the courtroom for the day's proceedings, Trump once again alleged that the trial constitutes election interference, claiming that the proceedings are unfairly keeping him off the campaign trail. ""Everybody knows that I'm here instead of being able to be in Pennsylvania and Georgia and lots of other places campaigning, and it's very unfair,"" he told reporters. ""It's a very, very sad day in America,"" he said. ""I can tell you that."" The former president is seated at the defense table between his lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove. Apr 22, 9:37 AMProceedings are underway The proceedings are underway in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial. Trump and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg are both in the courtroom. Three prosecutors -- Joshua Steinglass, Matthew Colangelo, and Susan Hoffinger -- are seated at the counsel table. Bragg is seated in the front row of the gallery with approximately a dozen lawyers and staff from his office. Apr 22, 9:26 AMEx- publisher to be 1st witness, say sources The first witness prosecutors with the Manhattan DA's office plan to call is former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, according to two sources familiar with the matter. ABC News previously reported that prosecutors planned to call Pecker as a witness, but sources now say he's expected to be the first witness to take the stand. Pecker served as the longtime chief executive of American Media Inc., which published the National Enquirer. Shortly after Trump announced his 2016 presidential campaign, Pecker met with Trump and agreed to act as the ""eyes and ears"" of the campaign by looking out for and killing negative stories about Trump, according to the Manhattan DA. As part of the arrangement, Pecker allegedly directed a deal to pay $30,000 to a former Trump Tower doorman regarding the false allegation that Trump allegedly fathered a child out of wedlock, prosecutors say. Then-Trump attorney Michael Cohen allegedly insisted that the deal stay in place even after AMI discovered the allegation was false, and AMI paid the doorman, according to the Manhattan DA. Apr 22, 5:55 AMAttorneys to present opening statements in historic trial After a week-long selection process, the jurors in Donald Trump's New York hush money case will hear opening statements Monday in the first criminal trial of a former United States president. To prove their case, lawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg need to convince 12 jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump repeatedly falsified records related to unlawfully influencing the 2016 presidential election. ""This case has nothing to do with your personal politics or your feelings about a particular political issue,"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told potential jurors on Thursday. ""It's not a referendum on the Trump Presidency, a popularity contest, or any indication of who you plan to vote for this fall. This case is about whether this man broke the law."" Trump's lawyers are expected to focus their efforts on going after the credibility of prosecution witnesses, suggesting the case itself is politically motivated and arguing the former president never intended to commit a crime.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation postponed votes on two competing plans that would have given the agency more power to scrutinize asset managers after it was clear neither had the majority backing of the five-member board. Officials said they planned to refine the proposals. ""If these fund complexes are using their purportedly passive investment funds to push social policy, to influence bank policy, there's a real significant issue here,"" FDIC board member Jonathan McKernan said at the agency's public board meeting on Thursday. At issue is growing concern among some policymakers over large asset managers' expanding footprint in the banking sector, driven by the growth of index investing. They worry big asset managers are exerting undue influence on the management of companies in their portfolios, despite ostensibly being passive investors. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street together manage some $23 trillion and are often the largest investors in S&P 500 companies. Some policymakers also worry that passive investors' growing footprint in public companies reduces competition. Academic studies have come to varied conclusions. But consumer activists and U.S. Republican politicians have seized on the issue as a way to scrutinize the policies of the investment firms. Banking and asset management industry executives have resisted more scrutiny, arguing the current arrangement has proven itself. ""For more than 20 years, U.S. bank regulators have concluded that regulated funds' passivity commitments ensure they do not exercise control over the banks in which they invest,"" said a spokesperson for the Investment Company Institute, which represents investment funds. ""Any suggestion that this regulatory approach should be changed lacks substantiation and could harm fund investors."" 'PREMATURE' STEP One of the plans by McKernan, a Republican, would direct FDIC staff to regularly assess if asset managers are complying with ""passivity agreements"" not to leverage their investments to steer operations or push policies. If an asset manager is exerting influence, the FDIC would subject them to stricter regulation. However, FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said he believed this step to be ""premature,"" and that the agency should solicit more public feedback. A second proposal, backed by Gruenberg and offered by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra, who sits on the board, would remove an FDIC policy that requires the agency to defer to the Federal Reserve on passivity agreements involving bank holding companies. The proposal includes soliciting feedback on the growing role of asset managers in banks. Chopra argued the FDIC should be more directly involved in such matters, given the agency's responsibility for ensuring banks are safe. That plan was also shelved after Michael Hsu, acting Comptroller of the Currency, said he would not vote for either approach. Instead, he argued all three major U.S. bank regulators should work together on a consistent approach to policing bank control. ""Further research, analysis, and debate are clearly needed,"" Hsu said.

Trump trial live: New witnesses take the stand to testify about ex-president's ties to Stormy Daniels - Yahoo News Australia,Trump trial live: New witnesses take the stand to testify about ex-president's ties to Stormy Daniels  Yahoo News Australia,"Thu, 15 Feb 2024 09:43:55 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYXUubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdHJ1bXAtaGVhZHMteW9yay1zdG9ybXktZGFuaWVscy0wOTQxMDc2NTEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo News Australia,"Donald Trump returned to court for the latest instalment of his New York hush money trial this morning, where the jury heard further testimony from tabloid mogul David Pecker who detailed the “catch-and-kill” scheme to suppress stories about the defendant’s alleged affairs. The former National Enquirer publisher doubled down on his testimony that he bought and silenced the story of Playboy model Karen McDougal’s affair with Mr Trump to influence the 2016 election. With cross-examination complete, the court then heard from Trump executive assistant Rhona Graff and Guy Farro of First Republic Bank who set up a wire transfer to Stormy Daniels. Justice Juan Merchan is yet to rule on whether Mr Trump should be held in contempt and fined $10,000 for allegedly violating a trial gag order by posting about witnesses and jurors on Truth Social. In other legal news, Supreme Court justices heard oral arguments concerning Mr Trump’s “presidential immunity” defence against prosecution in federal cases, and the former president had his latest efforts to overturn the E Jean Carroll defamation verdict against him dismissed. Alex Woodward is providing live updates from the courthouse in Manhattan. Key Points What to expect on day eight of Trump’s New York hush money trialSupreme Court justices appear poised to offer Trump some immunityTrump loses latest bid for new E Jean Carroll trialFormer president backs away from testifying over porn star payment 21:30 , Oliver O'Connell Cohen then applied for another LLC, Essential Consultants LLC, which was intended to “collect fees for investment consulting for real estate transactions,” according to a form. The prosecution says they're at a stopping point for today. Judge Merchan asks them to approach before excusing the jurors. “We'll call it a week.” 21:24 , Alex Woodward The LLC is Resolution Consultants LLC, the shell company that Cohen used to set up the McDougal transfer that Pecker ultimately backed out of. The type of business on the First Republic Bank form to set up the LLC is listed as “MANAGEMENT CONSULTING”. Cohen is the only listed officer for the LLC. Cohen signed off on it on 13 October 2016, two days after calling Farro's office to try to set it up. A question on the form asked “is the entity associated with political fundraising/political action committees?” The corresponding box was checked “no”. On the morning of October 26, Farro's assistant emailed Farro asking him to return Cohen's call. He did. “He said he was changing course, no longer wanted to open Resolution Consultants, and wanted to open a new account,” Farro says. “Every time Michael Cohen spoke to me he gave me a sense of urgency ... This was one of those times.” The account had never actually opened, because Cohen didn't pay for it, so there wasn't anything to do necessarily. Full story: Trump’s longtime assistant testifies to ‘vague’ memory of seeing Stormy Daniels at Trump Tower 21:10 , Oliver O'Connell Alex Woodward reports from the courthouse: A former longtime assistant to Donald Trump at his Trump Organization testified that she has a “vague recollection” of seeing adult film star Stormy Daniels at Trump Tower before his 2016 presidential campaign. Rhonna Graff, who worked at the Trump Organization for more than 30 years, testified on Friday at a criminal trial in Manhattan across from her former boss, who is charged with falsifying business records to cover up payments to Ms Daniels as part of a scheme to bury details of an alleged affair. She testified that she saw Ms Daniels in the lobby of the 26th floor of Trump Tower, where Mr Trump’s office is located. Continue reading... 21:09 , Alex Woodward An email in the morning from October 13 2016. The subject line is: FW: Message from ""26-Copier-Pantry"" There's a PDF attachment. Farro then emailed one of his coworkers about opening an account for Cohen “immediately”. 21:05 , Alex Woodward We see an email from October 11 2016 from Farro's assistant about a missed call from Michael Cohen. She sent another email two days later asking him to please return his call “regarding an important matter”. When he called back, Cohen said he wanted to open an LLC account. This was all roughly three weeks before election day. 21:01 , Alex Woodward Farro: ""Michael Cohen was assigned to me after a client left in 2015."" He said he believed he was given Cohen for “my knowledge and my ability to handle individuals who may be a little challenging”. “Michael did a lot of his own business and frankly I didn’t find him difficult,” he said. 20:59 , Oliver O'Connell Gary Farro is the next witness — the third of the trial — and was formerly a senior managing director at First Republic Bank. He says he's here voluntarily, but “I did receive a subpoena”. He now works at Flagstar Bank but worked at First Republic Bank for 15 years, beginning in 2002. It was there he allegedly set up the home equity line of credit through which Michael Cohen paid Stormy Daniels. Kirsti Noem makes shocking admission she shot pet dog she 'hated' 20:38 , Oliver O'Connell Mike Bedigan reports: One of the candidates in the running to be Donald Trump’s pick for Vice President has admitted that she once shot a pet puppy that she “hated”. Kristi Noem wrote about an incident with the dog, named Cricket, who she called “untrainable” and “less than worthless”. She also claimed to have put down an unnamed, family-owned goat because he was “nasty and mean”. Ms Noem, the Governor of South Dakota is seen as a leading contender to be Mr Trump’s running mate for the November presidential election. Yikes... 20:20 , Alex Woodward We see an email from Graff to Madeleine Westerhout at the White House on April 6 2017: Here is the Fed Ex label you requested. Hope it works ; ) Necheles asks: The only reason you’re testifying here today is because you worked at the Trump Organization? Yes. You don’t want to be here, do you? ""Correct."" Lawyers are expensive, aren’t they? ""I haven’t seen the bills but I assume they are."" The Trump Organization is paying bills for all employees? Yes. Is the payment of your legal fees conditioned on how you testify? No. No one from the Trump Organization has told you how to testify? No. No further questions and no follow-ups from the prosecution. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche asks for a sidebar. The celebrities dragged into Trump’s hush money trial 20:15 , Oliver O'Connell A string of famous names have been dragged into Donald Trump’s historic criminal trial, after four days of testimony from the former publisher of the supermarket tabloid The National Enquirer. David Pecker became the first witness to take the stand in the former president’s New York hush money trial this week, laying out a so-called “catch-and-kill” scheme at the centre of the case. Joe Sommerlad has the story... 20:14 , Alex Woodward Graff agrees with Necheles that Trump “was actively involved” with The Apprentice, and that part of her job duties was to work with the show's producers. “He was very hands-on, yes. … At the time it was probably the most popular TV show,” she says. The series elevated him to “a whole other platform from being a businessman to … rock star status.” Graff says she has some memory of Trump saying he thought Stormy might be a “good contestant” on the show. “I can't remember a specific incident when I heard it. It was part of the office chatter.” 20:13 , Alex Woodward Susan Necheles is now cross-examining Graff. What was it like working for Trump? I never had to do the same day twice. It was a very stimulating, exciting ... place to be. Was he a good boss? “I think he was fair, and what’s the word I’m looking for ... Respectful to me.” Did he respect your intelligence? “I don’t think I would have been there 34 years if he didn’t.” What was a typical day? “There was no typical day. I would usually get there early in the morning … see what was on the calendar and see what was happening … Those kinds of things.” 20:11 , Alex Woodward After establishing the Trump Organization protocols for keeping and maintaining contact information and managing email communications, Hoffinger gets down to more pertinent questions. We see an entry for Karen McDougal's contact information (including a Yahoo email account). And another for Stormy Daniels, which includes her phone number. The name is simply ""Stormy."" Graff has a ""vague recollection"" of seeing Stormy Daniels in the reception area at Trump Tower. She knew she was an adult film actress. We see a few appointment calendar entries for Jan 17 and Jan 18 2017, a few days before Trump was inaugurated. He had an interview with Ainsley Erhardt, a couple of teleprompter practice sessions, and a meeting with “Mike Allen - per Hope” for a photo shoot with The Washington Post in the lobby area of the 25th floor. He also had his ""Wheels Up"" time at LGA on Jan 19, one day before the inauguration. ...and that’s it for the prosecution. New witness: Rhona Graff 19:46 , Oliver O'Connell Rhona Graff is Donald Trump’s former long-time executive assistant, dubbed his “gatekeeper”. She's on the stand wearing a black t-shirt and black cardigan with a large turquoise amulet. Prosecution attorney Susan Hoffinger is up to begin questioning Graff. She spent 37 years at the Trump Organization, first as an executive assistant all the way up to senior vice president. Mr Trump was her boss. Trump’s attorneys try to pick holes in David Pecker’s ‘catch and kill’ testimony 19:45 , Oliver O'Connell Alex Woodward reports from the courthouse: Donald Trump’s defence attorneys have tried to undermine trial testimony from one of the alleged architects of a scheme to buy up politically damaging stories to boost Mr Trump’s 2016 election chances. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, the first witness in the historic trial in a Manhattan courtroom, answered a barrage of “yes” or “no” questions from Mr Trump’s lawyer Emil Bove on Thursday and Friday, hoping to poke holes in his week-long testimony that the former president and his then-attorney Michael Cohen conspired with him to influence the election. At one point on Friday, Mr Bove tried to get Mr Pecker to admit that he either lied on the witness stand or to federal law enforcement about Mr Trump “thanking” him for his help burying stories of Mr Trump’s alleged affairs. Continue reading... 19:44 , Alex Woodward Bove mentions the anthrax incident at the AMI office in Florida, and how Pecker testified that Trump was one of the first people to reach out. “Trump was one of the first people to reach out to see if you’re OK,” Bove says. “You know he cares about people. ... He cares about his family. ... And you know that, right?” Bove says. “The types of stories you’re talking about today and in 2016 were things that were stressful.” Pecker agrees. Bove has no further questions and Pecker can step down. Re-cross-examination of Pecker by Bove 19:43 , Alex Woodward Trump defence attorney Emil Bove is now re-cross-examining David Pecker. Bove, again asking yes or no questions only, asked Pecker whether having McDougal around at AMI would be a boost to the company because of her “celebrity” and brand value. The overflow crowd burst out laughing. Pecker fumbled around a bit before answering. “Did she meet the celebrity category at that time? Uh, no.” 19:32 , Alex Woodward Despite just getting back down to business, Trump's eyes appear to be closed again. It almost looks meditative. Like he's listening harder. Steinglass reads from a federal law enforcement summary of Pecker's summary of his January 6 2017 meeting at Trump Tower. Bove had tried to suggest Pecker was lying when he said that Trump thanked him for handling the McDougal and doorman stories. Steinglass: “Did you in fact tell the FBI that the defendant thanked you for the Karen McDougal story and Dino Sajudin story?” Yes. “Was that the truth then?” Yes. “Was that the truth now?” Yes. “Do you believe you have ever been inconsistent on that point?” No. Court resumes as redirect questioning of Pecker continues 19:23 , Oliver O'Connell Court has returned from lunch with David Pecker being questioned on redirect by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass. Alex Woodward is reporting live for The Independent from the courthouse. ‘The King of Pettiness' 19:15 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump has had many nicknames throughout the years, from giving himself the moniker ‘very stable genius’ to the more recent ‘Sleepy Don’ – coined by social media users reacting to him apparently during the first day of the ongoing hush money trial. However, The Daily Show’s Jordan Klepper has bestowed a new nickname upon the former president as the “king of pettiness” after Trump’s latest Truth Social rant, launched at former attorney general Bill Barr. Amelia Neath has the story: ‘Let’s do it tonight’ Trump fumes as Biden says he’ll debate him 18:53 , Oliver O'Connell In a live radio interview this morning, President Joe Biden said he would be “happy” to debate former president and current criminal defendant Donald Trump as part of the 2024 presidential election campaign. Mr Trump couldn’t let that go and — much like when he says he will testify in his trials — accused the president of not really meaning it. While Mr Biden has the actual presidential debates in mind that traditionally come in the fall, the former president began suggesting evenings next week, and even tonight at the courthouse — not sure those optics would work in Mr Trump’s favour.... Here’s what he wrote on Truth Social: Crooked Joe Biden just announced that he’s willing to debate! Everyone knows he doesn’t really mean it, but in case he does, I say, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, ANYPLACE, an old expression used by Fighters. I suggest Monday Evening, Tuesday Evening, or Wednesday Evening at my Rally in Michigan, a State that he is in the process of destroying with his E.V. Mandate. In the alternative, he’s in New York City today, although probably doesn’t know it, and so am I, stuck in one of the many Court cases that he instigated as ELECTION INTERFERENCE AGAINST A POLITICAL OPPONENT - A CONTINUING WITCH HUNT! It’s the only way he thinks he can win. In fact, let’s do the Debate at the Courthouse tonight - on National Television, I’ll wait around! There is no evidence that President Joe Biden has in any way orchestrated any of the civil or criminal indictments against Mr Trump. The federal cases were handed off to Special Counsel Jack Smith by the Department of Justice to avoid any possible influence by the administration. The state and local cases are beyond the remit of the federal government. All four criminal cases were presented to grand juries of US citizens who recommended that charges be brought. In pictures: This morning in court 18:30 , Oliver O'Connell Redirect questioning of Pecker in one image 18:20 , Oliver O'Connell Courtesy of MSNBC: Court breaks for lunch 18:04 , Alex Woodward The jury has been excused for lunch. Steinglass has half an hour to go on redirect. Bove wants to re-cross Pecker. Todd Blanche also asks for the name of the next witness. The judge will come back to that after lunch. 18:01 , Alex Woodward Steinglass: “Had you published a story about a Playboy model having a yearlong sexual affair while he was married … would that have sold magazines? … That would be like, National Enquirer gold. … At the time you entered into that agreement, you had zero intention of publishing that story. … You killed the story because it helped candidate Donald Trump.” Pecker: “Yes.” 17:58 , Alex Woodward Steinglass hammers home the main point the prosecution is trying to make and mentions prior AMI plans to suppress coverage in other stories. “In this case, did you suppress stories to help a presidential candidate?” “Yes.” Steinglass also points out that Pecker and AMI didn’t make similar arrangements with other political candidates to write certain stories, which Pecker admits was done in coordination with the campaign. Pecker, revisiting the Trump Tower meeting: “It was my understanding, I would use the company sources … for any information that would be coming out on Mr Trump or the campaign, related to — specifically — women, who would be selling their stories, similar to what I experienced with Schwarzenegger … My understanding is those stories would come up, I would speak to Michael Cohen, I would tell him that these stories are going to be for sale, and someone else would buy them if we don’t. … That was my understanding of that meeting.” 17:36 , Alex Woodward Pecker admits that the August 5 2016 contract does not mention Trump reimbursing him, Cohen, the plan to reassign life rights to Trump, nor the arrangement at Trump Tower. “Does the contract even mention the word campaign?” Steinglass asks. (No, it does not.) 17:30 , Alex Woodward Pecker confirms that the “true purpose” of the McDougal contract with to acquire the life rights of her story, and that the other parts of the agreement – columns, cover appearances, blog posts, ghostwriters, etc. – gave the deal “plausible deniability”. Pecker: “It was included in the contract basically as a disguise of what the actual purpose of it … The actual purpose of it was to acquire the lifetime rights … It would be published by American Media. It would not be published by any media source.” Redirect questioning of Pecker begins 17:27 , Alex Woodward Bove asks about Pecker’s testimony that Cohen was trying to get access to boxes with materials about Trump, out of concern that he would leave AMI. Bove suggests it’s because of his “job application” with Time. Pecker clarifies that in 2016, AMI was “looking to acquire all of Time.” He wasn’t applying for a job there. Pecker also confirms that the contents of those boxes was worthless. Bove wraps up, with a reminder in the form of a question about Pecker’s obligation to the truth, and that jurors will be the judge of that. Pecker: “I’ve been truthful to the best of my recollection.” That’s it for Bove. Redirect from prosecutor Joshua Steinglass. Biden ‘happy’ to debate Trump 17:20 , Oliver O'Connell President Joe Biden on Friday said he will participate in televised debates with his likely opponent, former president Donald Trump, before the 5 November presidential election. Mr Biden said he’d debate Mr Trump during an hour-long, wide-ranging interview with Sirius-XM radio host Howard Stern after Stern asked him whether he’d do so. Andrew Feinberg reports: 17:12 , Alex Woodward Bove asks about an October 2019 meeting with the District Attorney’s office, in which Bove suggests he described that paragraph 3 was “wrong and inaccurate”. Bove reads: “I think that may be inaccurate. I think that came up with the feds. I have never heard Pecker saying that.” “Do you remember that?” “No.” Pecker: “My testimony I gave, I offered at that meeting to be the eyes and ears … The stories, women would be selling them and I would offer them to Michael Cohen. Selling and purchasing here are synonymous. Someone has to buy them.” “Based on your experiences, Michael Cohen was prone to exaggeration?” Yes. “You could not trust everything he said?” Objection. Sidebar. This feels too close to an attempt to impeach another witness who hasn’t testified yet. Question answered 17:08 , Oliver O'Connell Yesterday, Donald Trump was sucking on some type of candy or lozenge he kept taking out of his jacket while seated in court. He sounded very hoarse at the end of the day. Today, Ben Kochman of The New York Post spotted what it was: 17:02 , Oliver O'Connell Here’s the paragraph of the non-prosecution agreement that is being focused on by Bove questions: 3. In or about August 2015, David Pecker, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMl, met with Michael Cohen, an attorney for a presidential candidate, and at least one other member of the campaign. At the meeting, Pecker offered to help deal with negative stories about that presidential candidate's relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided. Pecker agreed to keep Cohen apprised of any such negative stories. 16:55 , Alex Woodward “AMI’s assets are worth less to Hudson News Group if AMI is subject to federal investigation?” Pecker: “The investigation is not going to reduce the earnings of the company, of the magazines.” But what if AMI had been indicted? Bove asks. He hits the word indicted like it’s italicised. Pecker admits that yes that would’ve been an issue. The non-prosecution agreement is just that, however. It does not criminally charge AMI. “There’s no admission by AMI in this agreement of a campaign violation, correct?” Bove aks. Bove is focusing on a clause about the federal government prosecuting AMI for “false, incomplete or misleading testimony or information.” That “gives the federal government some options if it determines that AMI or its representatives give false or misleading testimony, right?” Court resumes 16:44 , Oliver O'Connell Alex Woodward is reporting for The Independent from the courthouse in Lower Manhattan: Pecker is recalling the FBI’s search of his phone in April 2018. Agents showed up at his home around 8am. He pushed back at Bove’s description of those meetings as “stressful” but admitted he wanted to get them over with. We’re looking at Pecker’s nonprosecution agreement with the Justice Department from September 2018, which Pecker testified about yesterday. Bove is suggesting that Pecker and AMI were under pressure from a deal for the company to get sold off to Hudson News Group. Asked by Bove whether that meant that AMI needed to get the investigations cleared up, Pecker pauses and says yes. “The federal investigation needed to get resolved before the deal could go through, correct?” Pecker, after a pause: “The transaction could’ve closed subject to the investigation being completed.” How does Trump interact with others in court? 16:33 , Oliver O'Connell Norm Eisen, legal analyst for CNN and senior fellow at the Brookings Governance, had an interesting interaction with the former president as the court went on its break... 16:18 , Oliver O'Connell Alex Woodward reports from the courtroom: Bove has less than an hour of cross-examination left. Then there’s some redirect. It’s highly likely that Pecker will be done today. I doubt we’ll get an idea who the next witness will be for Monday, but last time prosecutors gave the defence a heads-up the afternoon before. Thus far, Bove hasn’t done much if anything to undermine Pecker’s credibility, and Pecker’s description of events is consistent with his prior testimony. Jurors are only getting the defence’s perspective, not anything new about what happened. ‘I would if it’s necessary’: Trump seems to get cold feet about testifying in New York hush money trial 16:15 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump appears to be getting cold feet about taking the stand to testify in his criminal hush money trial, after he previously insisted that he would “absolutely” do so. The former president called in to Newsmax on Thursday night after the conclusion of day seven of his historic trial. Anchor Greg Kelly asked him about his intentions to testify in his own defence based on what he had seen of the proceedings so far. “Well I would if it’s necessary,” Mr Trump answered. Joe Sommerlad and Alex Woodward report on the former president apparently losing confidence... 16:15 , Alex Woodward “This is the FBI’s interview, is that correct? These are the FBI notes? The FBI notes, some of these here, are wrong. I know what I testified to yesterday,” says Pecker. Are you saying the FBI made a mistake here? “I know what the truth is. I can’t state why it’s written this way.” Bove: “Your testimony is inconsistent with what’s written here?” Steinglass, loudly: “Objection.” Morning recess. 15 minutes. 16:12 , Alex Woodward During that meeting on 6 January 2017, according to Pecker yesterday, Trump told him “I want to thank you for handling the McDougal situation” and “the doorman situation”. Bove: “Was that a mistake?” Pecker: “No.” Bove: “Do you believe Trump said that to you as we sit here right now?” Pecker: “Yes I do.” Bove reminds him about what prosecutors in other meetings have said about the importance of telling the truth, and how it could be criminal if he does not. He is reminded of a report from a meeting with law enforcement about the meeting that notes that “Trump did not express any gratitude towards Pecker and AMI.” “I don’t recall.” Bove shows the interview report to Pecker. He’s been scanning the document and can’t seem to find what Bove is telling him. 16:04 , Alex Woodward Questioning now turns to the topic of Stormy Daniels. “You did not authorise [editor Dylan] Howard to speak to Keith Davidson about Stormy Daniels?” Yes. What Howard did was “unauthorised and outside of his employment?” Steinglass objects. It’s sustained. When Howard told him that Michael Cohen has not paid Keith Davidson, “you were surprised to hear that” because you told him to “stay out of it” and you were “not happy.” Pecker agrees. “The main concern was Howard’s reputation,” Bove says. “The concern was Dylan Howard would look bad [if he doesn’t pay his sources] … And he said that to you.” “And so you and Howard called Cohen, said to Cohen, I want you to know I’m not paying or doing anything on this. And you meant it.” Pecker agrees. Bove is asking about the meeting that Pecker walked into with James Comey, Sean Spicer et al when he was being briefed on the Fort Lauderdale mass shooting. “You knew that after that meeting there were some issues between President Trump and James Comey, right?” There is an objection, a sidebar with Judge Merchan, and then the objection is sustained. 15:53 , Alex Woodward The court is now looking at the payment to McDougal. Bove asks whether everyone who signed on to this was following procedure, and that there were no “false entries.” Pecker agrees. “You didn’t do anything inappropriate when you consulted counsel [about McDougal]? … When you told Cohen the deal was ‘bulletproof’, you meant it because you had legal advice?” Yes. In reference to Keith Davidson [McDougal’s lawyer], Bove asks about him learning that Dylan Howard was “using a major attorney as a source”? Pecker: “I wouldn’t classify him as a major attorney.” Pecker says Howard was just one of “50, several other editors” at the time, and “they all have their own sources” and how they get stories. He’s suggesting there wasn’t anything unusual about that pipeline. The “major attorney” answer got a laugh in the overflow room. Pecker smirked a bit. 15:37 , Alex Woodward Bove turns to the agreement signed by Karen McDougal, focusing on the bulk of that arrangement, concerning her role working for AMI properties. “AMI told Ms McDougal that her promotion to AMI magazines would be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars?” Yes. “Running 65 stories with Ms McDougal’s name?” Yes. “When AMI signed this agreement … you believed it had a legitimate business purpose, correct?” Yes. Yesterday, Pecker said he included those roles to “substantiate the $150,000 payment” to buy the rights to her story: “With respect to campaign, uh, laws, I wanted to have the contract be a record that stipulates that – for the services that she was going to perform for American Media – has a basis for it.” 15:32 , Alex Woodward Bove recalls Cohen trying to get a job with Mark Cuban in summer 2016, and Cohen calling on Pecker for a “little help” to arrange paparazzi to cover a meeting between them. Publishing those photos would “put pressure on Trump to treat Cohen differently” Bove says. “Michael Cohen never said that to me,” Pecker says. He admits that it could’ve looked that way. ‘Six or seven’ Trump supporters outside court 15:30 , Oliver O'Connell Media reporter Brian Stelter says on CNN that six or seven Trump supporters are outside the courthouse, some attempting to sell merchandise. 15:24 , Alex Woodward Pecker recalls Trump calling him in June 2016, which he previously recounted earlier this week. “Mr Trump called my office … Since I was in Chatham, New Jersey, my assistant transferred the call to Chatham. When the call came in, the assistant in the office, a small office, came over and told me President Trump was on the phone.” “When I spoke to Mr Trump, he wanted to know, he asked me, I spoke to Michael [Cohen], and I want to talk to you about Karen McDougal. So he said, Is it true there’s a Mexican group looking to buy the story for $8m? I said no, I don’t believe that’s true. Two, he said that [long pause] I’m recollecting completely. He said that [pause] I said that this story about Karen, since she’s claiming she had a relationship with you, should be taken off the market. Mr Trump said I don’t buy stories because it always gets out. I said I still think you should buy the story. Mr Trump said I’ll speak to Michael and get back to you.” One note: when Bove introduced McDougal, he was trying to get Pecker to admit that he knew about her because she was once a cover model for AMI property Men’s Fitness. But Pecker said they never met. He didn’t know her. 15:22 , Alex Woodward Cross-examination moves on to discussing Karen McDougal. Bove tells Pecker that McDougal didn’t want to publish her story but rather restart her career at AMI. Pecker agrees. “Her main interest was not publishing this story,” Bove asks. Pecker agrees. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass has been trying to object to Bove calling Trump “President Trump” referencing periods when he was not the president. “He wasn’t president in June 2016,” Steinglass says partially off-mic, laughing in frustration. 15:18 , Alex Woodward Questioning moves on to Dino Sajudin, the Trump World Tower doorman who had a false story about Donald Trump fathering an illegitimate child with a housekeeper. Pecker confirms that he never talked about it with Trump. We’re looking at the AMI contract with Dino for $30,000 to buy the rights to his story. Bove reminds Pecker that he previously testified that, if the story was true and he ran it, it would sell 10 million copies and be a bigger story than the death of Elvis. “At some point when this agreement was signed and the vetting process was completed, Sajudin was starting to make threats [to] go somewhere else, that’s why you paid him $30,000, right?” Yes. “You couldn’t have him going to another publication if that was true, right?” We’re looking at the contract amendment. Bove says it was “still possible” in Pecker’s mind that the story was true, and Pecker “couldn’t walk away.” Pecker agrees. 15:07 , Alex Woodward In another example, an Enquirer headline read: BEN CARSON ‘LIES’ OVER MILITARY & VIOLENT PAST. Bover notes that the story had been run by Politico days earlier. Bove’s line of questioning is trying to make the Enquirer look as if it was merely republishing other outlets, not singularly scheming to boost negative stories about Trump. “With substantially everything in the exhibits you were shown … The National Enquirer was recycling content from other publications because it was cost-efficient and it made business sense?” “Yes,” says Pecker. 15:03 , Alex Woodward Bove is trying to suggest that Pecker’s agreement with Trump and Cohen in 2015 was already in line with what The National Enquirer was doing, and not evidence of a conspiracy. Again — as yesterday — he’s framing every single question as a yes or no. “It made sense for the business to run articles about Bill and Hillary Clinton … Those articles were negative, right? … It’s easy to say that you would continue to do that during that August 2015 meeting, right? … Running those stories was beneficial to AMI, right? … Doing what’s good for AMI was standard operating procedure, right?” “There wasn’t much new content in those stories, was there,” regarding negative stories of Trump’s opponents Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz. “It was standard operating procedure for The National Enquirer to recycle content from other publications and frame it slightly differently, right?” Bove gives the example that The Guardian had already run articles about Carson’s malpractice before the Enquirer ran headlines about Carson leaving sponges in peoples’ brains. 14:54 , Alex Woodward Pecker is reading through a transcript in a defence exhibit of his testimony to a federal grand jury in 2018 about the fateful Trump Tower meeting in 2015. Basically, Bove is trying to pin down the fact that Pecker didn’t bring up Hope Hicks in that meeting with the feds, yet later said that she was in and out of that meeting in some capacity. Also, Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn is here in the court — as he was yesterday — in the same seat two rows behind Trump, one row behind the Secret Service. 14:49 , Alex Woodward Bove’s whole schtick yesterday just got sunk by Merchan. Merchan instructs the jury that there’s nothing weird about prosecutors speaking with witnesses before a trial. “The law permits the witness to do so,” he said. “Speaking to a witness about his or her testimony, reading materials, is a normal part of preparing for trial. It is not improper, as long as the witness does not depart from the truth.” Before getting back to Hope Hicks questions, Bove tells Pecker: “I want to apologize and move on from that.” 14:43 , Alex Woodward Assistant district attorney for Manhattan Joshua Steinglass raised a couple of issues, including the defence’s “improper impeachment” of tabloid mogul David Pecker on the stand yesterday, and defence attorney Emil Bove’s conflation of state and federal prosecutors – both of which made things (intentionally) unclear to the jury, in what seemed like an obvious attempt to derail his testimony and make him look unreliable. Pecker returns to the witness stand, for likely his last day in court (for now), and the jury is walking in. Where are Trump’s supporters? 14:41 , Oliver O'Connell Busy at work, presumably? Court resumes 14:38 , Oliver O'Connell Judge Juan Merchan is on the bench and addresses a couple of issues before the cross-examination of David Pecker resumes before the jury. He says that next week’s gag order hearing will be on Thursday at 9:30am. That’s the gag order violations hearing on the other four new allegations of contempt of court that popped up this week alone. He is yet to rule on the first 10 instances. The Independent’s Alex Woodward is reporting from inside the courtroom... Watch: Trump’s courthouse remarks in full 14:35 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump claims yesterday in court went “very well” and the case should “be over” if it weren’t for the “highly-conflicted” judge. The former president also remarked about his Supreme Court argument on presidential immunity and the “freezing courtroom”. Trump wishes Melania a happy birthday 14:31 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump begins his daily remarks to the media by wishing his wife Melania a happy birthday, saying he will join her down in Florida this evening. The former president says he would be with her if it weren’t for his trial. No Trump family members have attended the trial so far but are free to do so... Trump again claims his supporters can’t get to courthouse 14:27 , Oliver O'Connell And yet people protesting against him don’t seem to have a problem getting there? Rooting for Trump to fail has made his stock shorters millions 14:15 , Joe Sommerlad Here’s the latest on Trump Media and Technology, parent company of Truth Social, whose share price has fluctuated pretty wildly since its recent launch on the Nasdaq exchange but which is at least earning someone a few bucks. MAGA conspiracy blog files for bankruptcy amid defamation lawsuits 14:00 , Joe Sommerlad Bad news for MAGA as the popular conservative blog Gateway Pundit is filing for bankruptcy amid a string of defamation lawsuits it is facing. Launched in 2004, the site has been a hotbed of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, school shootings and other topics since its founding and has staunchly promoted by Trump and his allies. The site was even granted White House press credentials during his administration. But its peddling of conspiracy theories has landed the blog in hot water in recent years and it is now facing a string of lawsuits alleging it promoted bogus claims about the 2020 election. In a message posted on the site on Wednesday, the blog’s founder, Jim Hoft, said the outlet had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection “as a result of the progressive liberal lawfare attacks” and that this was “not an admission of fault or culpability”. Here’s Martha McHardy’s report. The National Enquirer was the go-to American tabloid for many years. Donald Trump helped change that 13:45 , Joe Sommerlad Catch-and-kill. Checkbook journalism. Secret deals. Friends helping friends. Even by National Enquirer standards, testimony by its former publisher David Pecker at Trump‘s hush money trial this week has revealed an astonishing level of corruption at America’s best-known tabloid and may one day be seen as the moment it effectively died. “It just has zero credibility,” said Lachlan Cartwright, executive editor of The Enquirer from 2014 to 2017. “Whatever sort of credibility it had was totally damaged by what happened in court this week.” Don Jr and Eric ‘helping to pick next Trump officials and staffers' 13:30 , Joe Sommerlad Trump’s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, are reportedly playing a central role in drawing up a list of potential candidates to join a second Trump administration in anticipation of their father’s victory over Joe Biden in November’s presidential election. The brothers are not running the transition team, leaving that responsibility to the Trump campaign’s senior adviser, Susie Wiles, but are instead playing a lead role in vetting prospective officials and staffers on ideological grounds. By doing so, they reportedly hope to ensure a greater degree of loyalty than the former president experienced during his chaotic first term in the White House from 2017 to 2021. Don Jr in particular has made it his mission “to keep the John Boltons of the world outside a second Trump administration”, one insider told Axios, referring to the Republican’s estranged former national security adviser, a foreign policy hawk who has become a potent critic since being dismissed in September 2019. Team Biden hits back after Trump dismisses Charlottesville as ‘little peanut’ 13:15 , Joe Sommerlad The Republican presidential candidate/criminal defendant may come to regret bringing up the notorious “Unite the Right” rally in his recent denunciation of pro-Palestinian demonstrations on American college campuses. Here’s Graig Graziosi’s report on his distinctly unhelpful comments. Live: Donald Trump's hush money trial continues in New York 13:00 , Joe Sommerlad Here’s your livestream link with the trial due to resume again shortly in Manhattan. Raskin denounces conservative Supreme Court justices as ‘partisan operatives’ helping Trump 12:45 , Joe Sommerlad Bravo to the redoubtable Maryland Democrat for this. New York hush money trial: What did Trump say after he left court yesterday? 12:30 , Joe Sommerlad Well, I guess you asked for it, so here’s a complete transcript of His Majesty’s (somewhat deranged) remarks from yesterday afternoon: “Today was breathtaking… breathtaking and amazing testimony. So this is a trial that should’ve never happened, this is a case that should’ve never been filed and was really an incredible, an incredible day. Open your eyes and we can’t let this continue to happen to our country. “On another matter, you know, the economy has just been reported to be doing very badly the stock market’s way down. And some horrible numbers came out, including very high numbers on inflation and in particular gasoline at seven and a half dollars in California and that usually leads the way. It’s going to happen here too. “And very importantly as you look at the various colleges all over the country and beyond colleges because it’s happening in other areas too. You see what’s happening on the front having to do with Palestine and Israel and protests and hate, anger Biden is sending an absolutely horrible message. Horrible, horrible message. He has no idea how to message. He can’t speak. He can’t put two sentences together. He doesn’t know what to do. This is not a president. This is somebody that shouldn’t be doing what he’s doing. Because he can’t do it again. He can’t do it well. “We’re having protests all over. He was talking about Charlottesville. Charlottesville was a little peanut. And it was nothing compared, the hate wasn’t the kind of hate that you have here. This is tremendous hate and we have a man that can’t talk about it because he doesn’t understand and he doesn’t understand what’s going on with our country. He doesn’t understand that all over the world we’re being laughed at as a country because of him and his administration. “And today we had, I hear, because I was forced to be here and I’m glad I was because it was a very interesting day in a certain way. But the US Supreme Court had a monumental hearing on immunity and the immunity having to do with presidential immunity. I think it was made clear, I hope it was made clear, that the president has to have immunity or you don’t have a president or at most you could say it would be a ceremonial president. That’s not what the founders had in mind. We’re not talking about ceremony. We want presidents that can get things done and bring people together. So, I heard it, the meeting was quite amazing coordination as the justices were on their game. So let’s see how that all pans out. But again, I say presidential immunity: very powerful, presidential immunity is imperative, or you practically won’t have a country anymore. Thank you very much.” Trump loses latest bid for new E Jean Carroll defamation trial 12:15 , Joe Sommerlad The former president’s request to have a new trial in his $83m defamation case with writer E Jean Carroll, who accused him of sexual assault, was denied by a federal court on Thursday. Judge Lews Kaplan of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected the motion. Here’s Eric Garcia’s report. New York hush money trial: What to expect on day eight 12:00 , Joe Sommerlad Our man Alex Woodward is back at the Manhattan Criminal Court once more this morning and says this: “We are going to have more cross-examination of David Pecker from Trump defence attorney Emil Bove today. “He didn’t give the judge a timeline for how long he’s going to take, but he’s speeding through questions to cast an overall pall of untrustworthiness in an attempt to impeach Pecker’s credibility on the stand. “We still haven’t heard from Justice Merchan about the 10 alleged gag order violations, so that could come up. “He also scheduled a hearing on four more alleged violations for next week.” You can see the prosecution’s filings on that here and here. Trump tells Newsmax he never actually wanted to ‘lock up’ Hillary Clinton and backs away from testifying 11:45 , Joe Sommerlad In another media phone-in last night, the defendant rowed back on one of his most notorious catchphrases and insisted again that he is on trial for no reason whatsoever. There was also plenty of electioneering hyperbole like this, which is simply untrue. “The best economy in history”?? Is that how you remember it America? Perhaps more significantly, he’s now saying he will only take the stand in Manhattan to defend himself “if it’s necessary”, a big retreat from his earlier posturing on the matter, presumably after being strongly advised against it by Todd Blanche and Emile Bove. Key takeaways from hush money trial day seven: Arnie, Melania and ‘mentor’ Trump 11:30 , Joe Sommerlad Here’s Kelly Rissman with a comprehensive round-up of Thursday’s events from Manhattan. New York hush money trial: Trump ‘used White House to manage blowback from affair allegations’ 11:15 , Joe Sommerlad According to Pecker’s testimony yesterday, Trump’s interest in the Karen McDougal story did not end with its initial suppression and his victory in the 2016 election. Instead, he continued to keep tabs on McDougal’s contractual agreement with American Media Inc to keep quiet through at least his first year in office, with Pecker recounting several incidents in which Trump asked after “our girl” and another in which he raged at the publisher after the story finally became public and the model was interviewed by CNN’s Anderson Cooper in March 2018. Here’s more from Alex Woodward. New York hush money trial: Arnold Schwarzenegger dragged into Trump web of intrigue 10:45 , Joe Sommerlad Pecker, who will be back on the stand for probably the final time today for more cross-examination from Trump attorney Emile Bove, also revealed on Thursday that he previously had a similar “catch-and-kill” arrangement with Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger during his run to be governor of California. His name came up, along with those of other celebrities like Mark Wahlberg and Tiger Woods, when Pecker was asked about how commonplace his “checkbook journalism” antics were. Here’s Alex Woodward on that too. New York hush money trial: David Pecker testifies to Trump plan to bury Karen McDougal story 10:15 , Joe Sommerlad Back in Manhattan, the former National Enquirer was back on the stand for his third day of testimony about his magazine’s “catch-and-kill” game. Pecker testified that he agreed to spend tens of thousands of dollars to buy and then bury politically compromising stories about Trump with the assurance that “the boss will take care of it”. That promise, allegedly from Trump’s then-personal attorney Michael Cohen, gave the ex-American Media Inc chief the green light to pay Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 to buy the rights to her story of an alleged affair with the then-presidential candidate. Alex Woodward was there and sent this report. Key Takeaways from Trump’s immunity arguments at the Supreme Court 09:45 , Joe Sommerlad On the final day of arguments for this term, the nine justices questioned lawyers for Trump and Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith for three hours, toying with whether or not American presidents should be awarded broad, some or no immunity from criminal prosecution. Here are Ariana Baio’s takeaways from the hearing. Supreme Court justices appear poised to offer Trump some immunity 09:15 , Joe Sommerlad Trump is right that it was a “BIG DAY IN COURT(S)” yesterday, with the Supreme Court hearing oral arguments on his dubious “presidential immunity” defence and his hush money trial picking up in New York. In DC, the justices appeared poised to offer Trump and future US presidents some form of protection from criminal prosecution over actions carried out while in the White House while rejecting broad absolute immunity, acknowleding the “huge implications” of their eventual decision. Ariana Baio has this report on a monumental day, which could have major repercussions for this year’s presidential race, let alone the future of American democracy. Truth Social: Trump claims hush money trial ‘has completely fallen apart’ and bashes media rivals 08:49 , Joe Sommerlad Good morning! Let’s take a look at Trump’s latest social media output, shall we? Still absolutely refusing to learn his lesson regarding the gag order in the hush money trial, he has again referred to Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg as “Soros backed” and claimed, preposterously, that the case “has completely fallen apart” and that “Virtually every Legal Scholar and Expert has stated that there is no Crime, there never was.” Have they? You’d think we would have heard about that by now. Meanwhile, he’s continued to push his lie that the New York City authorities are suppressing (non-existent) mass MAGA protests outside the courthouse and posted further Fox News clips attacking the “sham” trial. Elsewhere, he’s back to trashing Morning Joe and The New York Times again like 2017 never ended but is curiously quiet on the subject of the Supreme Court, indicating, perhaps, that he realises just how pivotal the justices’ eventual ruling will be to his fate. Reversing Trump repeal, FCC restores net neutrality 08:15 , AP The FCC on Thursday restored “net neutrality” rules that prevent broadband internet providers such as Comcast and AT&T from favoring some sites and apps over others. The move effectively reinstates a net neutrality order the commission first issued in 2015 during the Obama administration; under then-President Donald Trump, the FCC subsequently repealed those rules in 2017. Net neutrality is the principle that providers of internet service should treat all traffic equally. The rules, for instance, ban practices that throttle or block certain sites or apps, or that offer higher speeds to customers willing to pay extra. Read more... Trump claims campus protests are worse than deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville 06:15 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump has claimed that the antisemitic, white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 was “peanuts” compared to the current pro-Palestine demonstrations across US college campuses. Mr Trump made the comments on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Wednesday. “Joe Biden would say, constantly, that he ran because of Charlottesville,” he wrote, referencing the 2020 election. “Well, if that’s the case, he’s done a really terrible job because Charlottesville is like a ‘peanut’ compared to the riots and anti-Israel protests that are happening all over our Country, RIGHT NOW.” Graig Graziosi has the story: Trump vows to beat Biden in New York 04:15 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump vowed to beat President Joe Biden in the 2024 election in New York as he made a surprise campaign stop at a construction site in Manhattan early on Thursday morning – on a day when testimony resumes in his hush money trial and the US Supreme Court hears arguments in his “presidential immunity” case. “We’re going to make a play for New York,” Mr Trump told reporters at the event. Martha McHardy has the story: 03:15 , Oliver O'Connell The National Enquirer was the go-to American tabloid for many years. Donald Trump helped change that 01:15 , AP Catch and kill.

The US District Court for the Southern District of New York handed down the denial on Thursday after Mr Trump had sought a new trial. In May 2023, a jury found Mr Trump liable for sexually abusing Ms Carroll. Then, earlier this year, a jury determined that Mr Trump for defaming Ms Carroll, with $65mn in punitive damages and $18mn in compensatory damages. In response, Mr Trump posted a $91.6mn bond to appeal the verdict against him. Read on...

We are still waiting on an order regarding the first 10. It is unclear if he'll do something about that before the next hearing or whether he will wait to do it all together. That seems doubtful. MAGA conspiracy blog files for bankruptcy amid string of defamation lawsuits Thursday 25 April 2024 21:45 , Oliver O'Connell Popular MAGA conspiracy blog Gateway Pundit is filing for bankruptcy amid a string of defamation lawsuits it is facing. The blog, which was launched in 2004, has been a hotbed of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, school shootings, and other topics since its founding and has staunchly promoted Donald Trump and his MAGA allies, with the site being granted White House press credentials during the Trump administration. But its peddling of conspiracy theories has landed the blog in hot water in recent years and it is now facing several lawsuits alleging it promoted bogus claims about the 2020 election. Martha McHardy reports: Watch: Hoarse-sounding Trump says testimony was ‘breathtaking’ Thursday 25 April 2024 21:42 , Oliver O'Connell Judge sets cause hearing for alleged gag order violations Thursday 25 April 2024 21:36 , Oliver O'Connell Thursday 25 April 2024 21:31 , Alex Woodward Steinglass is elaborating now without a jury present about his objection during the cross-examination of Pecker. “That was a totally improper line of questioning” and an “improper impeachment violation” of the witness, Steinglass says. Steinglass is arguing that the documents Bove has been referencing would not help Pecker remember what he's saying, leaving a false impression to jurors that Pecker could have remembered what he was saying if he looked at them. “There wasn't anything in that document and therefore it's misleading,” Judge Merchan said. Bove tries to jump in. Merchan cuts him off. “Are you missing my point?” he said. “Please be careful.” Court is done for the day. Thursday 25 April 2024 21:23 , Alex Woodward Bove questions Pecker's earlier testimony about Hope Hicks jumping in and out of the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting. That elicits an objection from prosecution attorney Joshua Steinglass. Judge Merchan sustains the objection. Bove is suggesting that Pecker didn't mention Hope Hicks at any point in his July 2018 meeting with prosecutors. ""I don't remember,"" Pecker says. Steinglass wants to approach the bench again. It's the third time they've done so over this particular line of questioning. Trump looks casual, and unworried, chatting with defence attorney Susan Necheles while the attorneys are at the bench. He's gestured towards them a couple of times. And with that, Merchan is excusing jurors for the day. Pecker is still on the stand, alone, looking like he's just seen a ghost. Cross-examination will resume and likely finish tomorrow. Pecker testimony gives insight into Trump’s preoccupation with McDougal affair Thursday 25 April 2024 21:08 , Oliver O'Connell Thursday 25 April 2024 21:06 , Alex Woodward Bove: “Because in fairness it's hard to remember the dates of these things even when they happened a couple of months ago, right?” Trump is the most alert he's been all day. Chin up, staring at Pecker, jerking his head. Bove keeps trying to suggest prosecutors prepped him for testimony and has been instructed to say what he's saying today. ""What I said under oath was the truth,"" Pecker says. ""That’s all I planned on doing today."" ""It's not a script."" Thursday 25 April 2024 21:01 , Alex Woodward Bove's line of questioning about Pecker not giving an exact date for the Trump Tower meeting in August 2015 suggests that he is trying to cast to the jury that his testimony is unreliable. He notes that Trump wasn't even in New York City in the first week of August because he was preparing for a debate. “You changed your testimony this week on this issue,” Bove says. Steinglass keeps trying to object. “Why did you change your testimony?” Bove says. Pecker wasn't sure what the date was, just that it was in the middle of August. “I don't mean to put you on the spot,” Bove says. “Even when you're doing your best ... it's hard to remember what people said almost 10 years ago, correct? ... You fill in some details to keep them in sequence, and to make them sound logical?” Pecker can only say yes. Bove will certainly be using this against him to make the rest of his testimony look wholly unreliable. Thursday 25 April 2024 20:58 , Alex Woodward Trump is slouching with his right arm slung over his chair. Bove gets Pecker to admit that he bought a story about Tiger Woods in order to use it for leverage to get him to appear in AMI titles. Trump has put his arm back down. Now he's crossing his arms and squinting and jerking his head to get a look at Pecker on the witness stand. We're hearing about Pecker's deals to suppress other stories about Rahm Emanuel and Mark Wahlberg. Thursday 25 April 2024 20:50 , Alex Woodward Bove is asking many yes or no questions. Pecker hasn't said much other than “yes”. Pecker agrees with Bove that he had never heard of a “catch-and-kill” scheme until after this case. Bove's questions all typically end with a “right?” or something to that effect, prompting Pecker to say some version of “yes”. It gives Bove a lot of control of the narrative to the jury. For example, here's Bove coming back to the Arnold Schwarzenneger scenario from 2002: In that period, you were trying to expand AMI's holding in the fitness business? Yes. A huge deal, right? worth about $365m? You wanted this to go through very much? Yes to all. You needed Arnold's blessing, correct? Yes. You met him in person and you reached an agreement? Yes, we did. Trump puts his sons ‘in charge of picking Trump administration officials round two’ Thursday 25 April 2024 20:45 , Oliver O'Connell Joe Sommerlad reports: Donald Trump’s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, are playing a central role in drawing up a list of potential candidates to join a second Trump administration in anticipation of their father’s victory over Joe Biden in November’s presidential election, Axios reports.

Thursday 25 April 2024 20:33 , Alex Woodward As cross-examination by Mr Trump’s defence team begins, Pecker agrees that AMI would publish half of the stories they purchased. ""Your ability as an executive and leader at AMI to control the release of the story was standard operating procedure between 1999 and 2020,"" Bove says. Pecker agrees. ""AMI has used hundreds of thousands of source agreements in the way we just talked about."" Pecker agrees. Cross-examination of David Pecker begins Thursday 25 April 2024 20:31 , Oliver O'Connell With approximately an hour left of court today, cross-examination of former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker begins with Donald Trump’s attorney Emil Bove now questioning the tabloid mogul.

The board granted Dimon a $1.5 million salary and $34.5 million of performance-based incentive compensation, according to a regulatory filing Thursday. His total pay is up 4.3% from 2022, when he made $34.5 million. “The firm is in a uniquely fortunate position to be led by such a highly talented and experienced executive who continues to grow the company, maintain market leadership positions, strengthen the firm’s reputation, invest in opportunities for the future, promote diversity and best practices, manage risk and develop great leaders, while also maintaining his focus on the firm’s clients,” the board said in the filing. JPMorgan pulled in $49.6 billion last year, boosted by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and its purchase of First Republic Bank in a government-led auction. Shares rose 27% during the year, outperforming all major rivals. That’s now turning into raises of more than 5% for the bank’s top brass. The firm awarded $30 million to President Daniel Pinto, $27 million to longtime asset and wealth management chief Mary Erdoes and $18.5 million apiece to consumer-banking co-heads Jennifer Piepszak and Marianne Lake, according to the company. Read More: It Was a Tough Year for Almost Every Bank Not Named JPMorgan Dimon, a billionaire, has been in his role for 18 years — a longer tenure than the CEO of any other major bank — and is often the highest-paid of his peers. In October, New York-based JPMorgan said in a filing that Dimon plans to sell 1 million of the bank’s shares, the first such transaction since he took the helm at the Wall Street giant, for financial diversification and tax-planning purposes. He’s long quipped that he plans to stay in his seat five more years, no matter when asked. That joke turned serious in 2021 when the board gave him a special incentive package worth more than $50 million to stay until at least 2026. Still, Dimon hasn’t indicated he views that award as a career closer. “I can’t do this forever, I know that, but my intensity is the same,” Dimon, 67, said at the firm’s investor day last year. “I think when I don’t have that kind of intensity, I should leave.” (Updates with compensation awarded to senior executives in fifth paragraph.) ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2023837!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/jamie-dimon.jpg,2024-04-25,0.575,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase & Co.', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dimon', 'latitude': 64.12834167480469, 'longitude': -19.906320571899414, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wall Street', 'latitude': 40.70579147338867, 'longitude': -74.00988006591797, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

To protect depositors, the FDIC entered into an agreement with Fulton Bank, National Association of Lancaster, Pennsylvania to assume substantially all of the deposits and purchase substantially all of the assets of Republic Bank. Republic Bank’s 32 branches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York will reopen as branches of Fulton Bank on Saturday (for branches with normal Saturday hours) or on Monday during normal business hours. This evening and over the weekend, depositors of Republic Bank can access their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards. Checks drawn on Republic Bank will continue to be processed and loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual. Depositors of Republic Bank will become depositors of Fulton Bank so customers do not need to change their banking relationship in order to retain their deposit insurance coverage. Customers of Republic Bank should continue to use their existing branches until they receive notice from Fulton Bank that it has completed systems changes that will allow its branch offices to process their accounts as well. Customers with questions about Fulton Bank’s acquisition of Republic Bank may call the FDIC toll-free at 1-877-467-0178. The FDIC’s Call Center will be open this evening until 9 p.m. Eastern Time (ET); on Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET; on Sunday from noon to 6:00 p.m. ET; on Monday from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET; and thereafter from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET. Interested parties may also visit the FDIC’s website. As of January 31, 2024, Republic Bank had approximately $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in total deposits. The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) related to the failure of Republic Bank will be $667 million. The FDIC determined that compared to other alternatives, Fulton Bank’s acquisition of Republic Bank is the least costly resolution for the DIF, an insurance fund created by Congress in 1933 and managed by the FDIC to protect the deposits at the nation’s banks.

To protect depositors, the FDIC entered into an agreement with Fulton Bank, National Association of Lancaster, Pennsylvania to assume substantially all of the deposits and purchase substantially all of the assets of Republic Bank,” the FDIC said in a statement. The bank had about $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in total deposits at the end of January, the FDIC said in its release. That makes Republic Bank (FRBK) far smaller than the regional bank failures that rocked the financial world last year. Silicon Valley Bank, for example, had about $209 billion at the end of 2022; it collapsed in March 2023. The FDIC said the former bank’s “32 branches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York will reopen as branches of Fulton Bank on Saturday (for branches with normal Saturday hours) or on Monday during normal business hours.” Those who have deposits at Republic Bank will become depositors at Fulton Bank, the FDIC said. The agency’s deposit insurance covers up to $250,000 per depositor. Bloomberg News reported earlier in the week that the FDIC had approached buyers for the regional lender. The FDIC said that Republic Bank was the first bank to fail in the United States since Citizens Bank in Sac City, Iowa, in November 2023. Republic First Bank is a separate entity from First Republic Bank, a San Francisco-based commercial bank that was closed in May 2023. The majority of the bank’s assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase. The Philadelphia-based bank’s failure comes at a tumultuous time for regional banks, as elevated interest rates have hurt the credit-dependent industry. Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse sparked a broader crisis last year. Signature Bank’s failure followed days later, and First Republic Bank failed a few weeks after that. In total, there were five bank failures in 2023, according to the FDIC. Recently, New York Community Bank saw wild swings in its stock price as customers began pulling their cash from the regional lender after it said it had identified “material weakness” in the company’s controls. The bank got a $1 billion equity investment lifeline from investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s firm, Liberty Strategic Capital, in March.

Republic First had roughly $6 billion in assets and another $4 billion in deposits in January, according to the FDIC. Fulton Bank reached an agreement with regulators to take over Republic First’s 32 branches in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, which will reopen under the Fulton Bank name, with the Pennsylvania-based bank assuming “substantially all of [Republic First’s] deposits and purchase substantially all of the assets,” the FDIC said in a statement. Shares of Republic First Bancorp plummeted Friday as investors moved away from the faltering bank, sinking 60% on the day to just over 1 cent—a drop in the bucket of its July 2006 peak at nearly $12.50. Key Background Republic First’s seizure makes it the fourth in just over a year to be seized by state and federal regulators, following the abrupt failure of Silicon Valley Bank last March, sparking fears about the stability of regional banks amid a series of bank runs depleting multiple banks’ assets. Just two days after SVB’s failure, New York-based Signature Bank, a leader in crypto lending, also shuttered, with New York regulators seizing the 23-year-old regional bank, along with its $110 billion in assets and $88 billion in deposits. San Francisco’s First Republic Bank became the next bank to fail last May, when federal regulators oversaw the offload of its assets to banking giant JPMorgan Chase. Sources told Bloomberg this week the FDIC was seeking bids for the Republic First, a move that comes less than six months after the agency suspended an auction for Republic First just one week after it reached a $35 million deal with the Norcross-Braca Group in a last-ditch effort to stave off a potential seizure and raise capital from investors. Norcross-Braca backed out of that deal last month. Big Number $250,000. That’s the amount of individual customer deposits the FDIC guarantees it will protect, meaning that customers can expect up to a quarter million dollars to be safe even if their bank collapses.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Friday it had seized the Philadelphia-based bank, which did business as Republic Bank and had roughly $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits as of Jan. 31. Fulton Bank, which is based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, agreed to assume substantially all of the failed bank's deposits and buy essentially all of its assets, the agency said. Republic Bank’s 32 branches will reopen as branches of Fulton Bank as early as Saturday. Republic First Bank depositors can access their funds via checks or ATMs as early as Friday night, the FDIC said. The bank's failure is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund $667 million. The lender is the first FDIC-insured institution to fail in the U.S. this year. The last bank failure — Citizens Bank, based in Sac City, Iowa — was in November. In a strong economy an average of only four or five banks close each year. Rising interest rates and falling commercial real estate values, especially for office buildings grappling with surging vacancy rates following the pandemic, have heightened the financial risks for many regional and community banks. Outstanding loans backed by properties that have lost value make them a challenge to refinance. Last month, an investor group including Steven Mnuchin, who served as U.S. Treasury secretary during the Trump administration, agreed to pump more than $1 billion to rescue New York Community Bancorp, which has been hammered by weakness in commercial real estate and growing pains resulting from its buyout of a distressed bank.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/dd567da2-1c6f-446d-8591-6da6ffc57941/wirestory_ac3caeb6eb7a77b12b01c02d5a289750_16x9.jpg?w=1600,2024-04-26,-0.323,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Fulton Bank', 'description': 'regional financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'Fulton Bank'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'WASHINGTON', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.962581634521484, 'longitude': -79.876708984375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania', 'latitude': 40.2724494934082, 'longitude': -76.90567016601562, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Jersey', 'latitude': 40.16706085205078, 'longitude': -74.49987030029297, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Lancaster', 'latitude': 40.037879943847656, 'longitude': -76.30551147460938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sac City', 'latitude': 42.42219924926758, 'longitude': -94.98970794677734, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Iowa', 'latitude': 42.00027084350586, 'longitude': -93.50048828125, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S. Treasury', 'latitude': 33.32728958129883, 'longitude': -107.71475982666016, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Trump', 'latitude': 39.68233108520508, 'longitude': -76.60218811035156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'York', 'latitude': 53.9576301574707, 'longitude': -1.0827100276947021, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Republic First Bank, a regional lender with $6 billion in assets, has failed and been seized by the FDIC.

It has sparked debate among the crypto community amid Bitcoin “Another bank just collapsed, the Republic First Bank. Yeah... I think I'll stick to Bitcoin,” CEO of Zesh Marius Martocsan stated in an April 26 post on X. “Republic First Bank failure is worth a look since bank failures are the best possible narrative we can get for crypto,” pseudonymous crypto trader Pillage Capital claimed in an April 26 post on X. “How many more need to fail before people start to be their own bank?” crypto commentator Randi Hipper asked her 87,100 X followers on April 26. After Republic First was seized by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities on April 26, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as its receiver. The agency will take on nearly all deposits and acquire all assets of Republic Bank, according to an April 26 statement published by the FDIC. Republic First had approximately $6 billion in total assets along with $4 billion in total deposits as of Jan. 31. Furthermore, the bank's 32 branches across New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York, will reopen under Fulton Bank's umbrella by the start of next week at the latest.

The Philadelphia-based bank, which had abandoned funding talks with a group of investors, was seized by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The FDIC, appointed as a receiver, said Fulton Bank, a unit of Fulton Financial, will assume substantially all deposits and purchase all the assets of Republic Bank to “protect depositors.” Republic Bank had about $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in total deposits, as of Jan. 31, 2024. The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund related to the failure of Republic Bank will be $667 million. The bank’s 32 branches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York will reopen as branches of Fulton Bank on Saturday or on Monday during business hours. The decision marks the latest regional bank failure following the unexpected collapses of three lenders – Silicon Valley and Signature in March 2023 and First Republic in May. Republic Bank had struck a deal with an investor group that included veteran businessman George Norcross, high-profile attorney Philip Norcross late last year, but that was terminated in February. After that deal collapsed, the FDIC resumed efforts to seize and sell the bank, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news. Republic Bank cut jobs and exited its mortgage origination business in early 2023 as it reeled under pressure from higher costs and inability to improve profitability The bank’s stock price has tumbled from just over $2 at the start of the year to about 1 cent on Friday, leaving it with a market capitalization below $2 million. Its shares were delisted from the Nasdaq in August and now trade over the counter.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/republic-first-bancorp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1714157676&w=1200,2024-04-26,-0.44,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Fulton Bank', 'description': 'regional financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'Fulton Bank'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.962581634521484, 'longitude': -79.876708984375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania Department of Banking', 'latitude': 40.26028060913086, 'longitude': -76.88263702392578, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fulton', 'latitude': 44.9119987487793, 'longitude': -93.32119750976562, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Jersey', 'latitude': 40.16706085205078, 'longitude': -74.49987030029297, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania', 'latitude': 40.2724494934082, 'longitude': -76.90567016601562, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Valley', 'latitude': 46.066810607910156, 'longitude': -62.7819709777832, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Street', 'latitude': 51.12350082397461, 'longitude': -2.738100051879883, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

In a presentation for investors in July, Republic First said that deposits were declining and that the bank’s mortgage lending business had become less valuable as interest rates increased. It had planned to exit the mortgage business and refocus on consumer deposits. It was delisted by Nasdaq in August, after it failed to file its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and an expected $35 million investment in the bank was scuttled this year, as reported by Banking Dive. Feddie Strickland, a bank analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, said that Republic First’s failure was likely to be an isolated incident and that the overall banking sector is stable. “I think small banks are in good shape,” Mr. Strickland said. “Some of the failures we saw last year were really banks with a certain specialization. I think there’s an importance of being diversified.” Mr. Strickland called Fulton, which is taking over Republic First’s deposits, “a boring bank in the best way,” calling the commercial bank “careful” and “good operators.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/26/multimedia/26bank-seizure/26bank-seizure-facebookJumbo.jpg,2024-04-27,-0.229,"[{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 37.12166976928711, 'longitude': -93.47138977050781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fulton', 'latitude': 44.9119987487793, 'longitude': -93.32119750976562, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Republic First Bank failed due to declining deposits and a less valuable mortgage lending business.

Fulton Bank in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, will assume substantially all of Republic First's $6 billion of assets and $4 billion of deposits, according to a statement from the FDIC. Republic First's 32 branches, which are spread across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, will open for business on Monday morning — or Saturday morning for locations that normally operate on the weekend — as Fulton Bank branches, the agency announced. Republic First's parent company, Republic First Bancshares, has been dealing with internal strife since late 2021, when a group of activist investors sought to force a sale of the bank, citing concerns about decisions made by then-CEO Vernon Hill. Problems for the bank compounded just six weeks later when a second investor group called for Hill's ouster. The embattled executive eventually succumbed to the pressure — following the death of a key ally — and lost his chairmanship of the bank's board in May 2022. Hill ultimately resigned from his post as CEO two months later. The bank attempted to raise $125 million in additional capital from investors last year — an effort that launched on the same day that Silicon Valley Bank failed — but the deal fell apart only months later. A subsequent capital infusion came together last fall amid reports that the FDIC was seeking a buyer for the troubled bank. But that capital raise also ultimately fell apart. As is customary in a bank failure, the FDIC was appointed receiver for Republic First after its failure. The sale to Fulton Bank will result in a $667 million loss for the Deposit Insurance Fund. In its announcement, the agency said the sale to Fulton Bank would be the least costly outcome for the fund. Republic Bank's demise is the first of this year.

Still, the defense ended the questioning of Pecker with a question also aimed at humanizing the former president. Defense attorney Emil Bove asked Pecker if he believed Trump cares about his family. He replied, “Of course I do.” Graff is another opportunity for the defense to continue to tell that story about Trump to the jury, Coates said.",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240426095335-06-donald-trump-hush-money-trial-042624-super-tease.jpg,2024-04-26,-0.319,"[{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Donald Trump', 'description': '45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021', 'full_name': 'Donald Trump', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Donald_Trump_official_portrait.jpg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'David Pecker', 'description': 'American businessman', 'full_name': 'David J.

According to Farro, Cohen needed to quickly create a new business named Resolution Consultants LLC. ""My understanding was it was a real estate consulting company,"" Farro testified. According to prosecutors, Resolution Consultants LLC was the shell company that Cohen planned to use to pay for the exclusive rights to Karen McDougal's story in which she claimed to have had a yearlong sexual relationship with Trump. Farro walked through the paperwork used to create the Delaware-based company, including a description, which said it was a consulting firm to offer ""strategy, PR and marketing."" He collected Cohen's signature and an affirmation that the company would not involve political fundraising. ""[It] would be something the bank wants to know,"" Farro said on the stand about political contributions, adding that it would trigger an additional review by the bank. Farro said that while the company was established, it was never funded. Prosecutors allege that the deal that prompted the creation of the account -- paying National Enquirer parent AMI for the McDougal story -- fell through at the last minute. A few weeks later, Farro received another phone call from Cohen on October 26, 2016. ""He stated he was changing course,"" Farro said. Prosecutor Becky Mangold asked if Cohen made the call seem urgent. ""Every time Michael Cohen spoke to me, he gave a sense of urgency,"" Farro said. ""This is one of those times."" Farro testified he was busy at the time -- ""I was at a golf course, very cliche for a banker"" -- but a colleague handled Cohen's request for the paperwork for a new company called Essential Consultants LLC. In the paperwork, Cohen described it as a ""real estate consulting company to collect fees for investment consulting work he does for real estate deals,"" Farro said. According to prosecutors, Cohen that day transferred $131,000 from a personal home equity line of credit into an account for Essential Consultants LLC. The next day, Cohen transferred $130,000 from that account to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, prosecutors allege. Farro's testimony is expected to continue when court resumes on Tuesday.

Trump on trial Day 8 recap: prosecution calls Michael Cohen's banker - USA TODAY,Trump on trial Day 8 recap: prosecution calls Michael Cohen's banker  USA TODAY,"Fri, 26 Apr 2024 02:45:32 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjQvMDQvMjYvZG9uYWxkLXRydW1wLXRyaWFsLWh1c2gtbW9uZXktY2FzZS1uZXdzLXVwZGF0ZXMvNzM0NjEzMzQwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,USA TODAY,"NEW YORK — The eighth day of Donald Trump's New York hush money trial gave the former president's legal team their chance to attack the story prosecutors have so far told of Trump colluding with a tabloid executive to boost his 2016 presidential campaign. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified this week about an alleged scheme to catch and kill stories that could hurt Trump's 2016 presidential election chances. On Friday, Trump's defense attorney Emil Bove elicited testimony from Pecker that the tabloid had other motives for its actions besides helping Trump's campaign. After Pecker's testimony concluded, the prosecution called former Donald Trump executive assistant Rhona Graff to the stand. Graff said she believed she created contact information entries for Trump for alleged paramours and hush money recipients Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. She was cross-examined by Trump attorney Susan Necheles. The prosecution then began examining its third witness, Gary Farro, the banker for former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, before the trial concluded for the day. Cohen who allegedly orchestrated the payments to McDougal and Daniels. Trump challenges Biden to debate in Michigan or at the White House Former President Donald Trump responded to President Joe Biden’s offer to debate by proposing meeting in Michigan or at the White House. Biden told radio host Howard Stern on Friday he was willing to debate as part of the 2024 campaign, although he wasn’t sure when. Trump immediately invited Biden to the New York courthouse, where he is on trial on charges of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to a porn actress. “We can do it any time he wants, including tonight,” Trump said. “We’re ready, willing and able.” Trump said the debate could happen any weeknight on national television. He suggested meeting in Michigan, to highlight criticism of what he argued was car manufacturers moving to China and elsewhere because of Biden’s support for electric vehicles. Another option is where they both have lived. “We’ll do it at the White House,” Trump said. “That would be very comfortable, actually.” −Bart Jansen Who is Gary Farro? Gary Farro is the former senior managing director at First Republic Bank. Farro was assigned Michael Cohen as a client in 2015, as the banker had expertise managing individuals that ""may be a little challenging."" Farro could be used to bring in email evidence about the payment issued to Stormy Daniels. CNN reported Cohen used money from his home equity line to cover Daniels' payment, and an email from a First Republic Bank employee confirmed the transfer. Proceedings end for the day Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold said she reached a natural stopping point for the day in her questioning of Farro. The judge dismissed the defense and prosecution at 4:29 p.m. ET. – Aysha Bagchi Records for second transaction for Cohen also indicate no political fundraising connection Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold showed Farro a form related to another possible transaction for Cohen. For this one, too, the form indicated the work wasn't related to political fundraising or a political action committee (PAC). – Aysha Bagchi Form for Cohen's planned account indicated no relation to political fundraising Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold showed Farro a form related to an account Cohen was trying to open. The form asked if the entity tied to the planned account was associated with political fundraising or a political action committee (PAC). The box indicating ""no"" was checked. Farro confirmed if the box indicating ""yes"" had been checked, the bank would have needed to do additional review. The particular account for that form was never opened, Farro testified. – Aysha Bagchi Cohen needed account for new LLC 'immediately' in October of 2016 Prosecution witness Gary Farro is being asked about emails concerning Michael Cohen's efforts in October 2016 to get an account opened at First Republic Bank for a new limited liability company. Cohen said it was related to real estate, according to Farro. According to an email from October 13, 2016, Cohen needed an account ""immediately."" Farro said on the stand that it wasn't unusual for Cohen to say he wanted something done immediately. – Aysha Bagchi Prosecution witness who worked with Cohen asked about emails Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold is asking Gary Farro, who said Michael Cohen was his client at a bank, about emails that went through the bank's server. It sounds like Farro could be used as a witness to bring in email evidence. – Aysha Bagchi Michael Cohen was Farro's client at bank Farro testified that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen was assigned to him as a client at First Republic Bank in 2015. Farro said he was told he was chosen to take over the Michael Cohen relationship because of Farro's knowledge and his ability to handle individuals that ""may be a little challenging."" Farro later added: ""Frankly, I didn't find him that difficult."" – Aysha Bagchi Third prosecution witness called: Gary Farro The prosecution has called its third witness, Gary Farro. He is discussing his experience in the banking industry. In 2016, he was a senior managing director at First Republic Bank, he said. – Aysha Bagchi Trump re-enters courtroom after short break Trump re-entered the courtroom at about 3:32 p.m. EST. We are still waiting for the judge and the jury. – Aysha Bagchi Trump stands and extends arm for handshake as Rhona Graff exits courtroom Graff's testimony ended and, as she was getting off the witness stand, former President Donald Trump stood up, moved toward where she would need to walk to exit the courtroom, said something to her, and extended his hand for a handshake. A court officer obstructed my view of their hands, but she appeared to look at him warmly. Before that, Graff testified that she didn't want to be at the court proceedings. Graff was using a cane. She appeared to walk at a normal pace. She was wearing black pants, a black top, a black cardigan, and a long, gold-colored necklace. – Aysha Bagchi Who is Rhona Graff? Rhona Graff is Donald Trump's former executive assistant and the second witness called to the stand in his criminal hush money trial. She was known as Trump's ""gatekeeper"" for decades before he became president, several outlets reported. Politico also said she helped with Trump's personal schedule during his first campaign. Graff was subpoenaed in Trump's New York civil fraud case, according to NBC News. She was also called on by the House Judiciary Committee to submit documents for a 2019 investigation into Trump. −Kinsey Crowley Graff recalls Stormy Daniels casting discussion for Celebrity Apprentice Former Trump executive assistant Rhona Graff testified to remembering a discussion about potentially casting porn star Stormy Daniels on The Celebrity Apprentice. – Aysha Bagchi Judge and lawyers privately talk after 'Celebrity Apprentice' raised Trump lawyer Susan Necheles began asking former Trump executive assistant Rhona Graff about the show, ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" After Necheles began to ask Graff about Trump's beliefs when it came to potentially boosting the show by having controversial people on it, the prosecution objected and there was a private conversation between the lawyers and the judge at the judge's bench, after which Necheles shifted to a new question. Stormy Daniels has previously described having sex with Trump as he seemed to be dangling the possibility of casting her on ""The Apprentice"" of ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" Trump denies they had sex. – Aysha Bagchi Graff testifies to positive memories working for Trump Trump lawyer Susan Necheles asked former Trump executive assistant Rhona Graff if Trump was a good boss. Graff responded that he was a fair and respectful boss to her. Graff confirmed Trump promoted her and gave her responsibility. Asked whether Trump respected her intelligence, Graff responded: ""I don't think I would have been there for 34 years if he didn't."" Graff also said she was given a good spot for witnessing Trump's presidential inauguration. – Aysha Bagchi Prosecutor ends questioning of second witness Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger ended her brief questioning of Graff. Defense lawyer Susan Necheles is now cross-examining Graff. – Aysha Bagchi Stormy Daniels was in Trump reception area, witness recalls Graff said she has a ""vague recollection"" of seeing porn star Stormy Daniels in the reception area of the 26th floor of a Trump building. – Aysha Bagchi Graff confirms creating entries for Trump of Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels contact information Graff said she believed she created contact information entries for Donald Trump of contact information for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. The McDougal information, which was displayed in redacted form in the courtroom, included a phone number and email address, while the Daniels information included a cell phone number. The Daniels entry was labeled ""Stormy"" and Graff said she believes that was Stormy Daniels. – Aysha Bagchi Graff may be used by prosecution to bring in evidence Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger is asking Graff about her awareness of various pieces of potential evidence. For example, Graff confirmed the Trump Organization server captured and saved emails during the ordinary course of its business. Graff also confirmed contact and calendar information tied to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal was saved. – Aysha Bagchi Former Trump executive assistant Rhona Graff testifying The prosecution has called former Trump executive assistant Rhona Graff to the stand. She is testifying about her responsibilities when it came to the Trump Organization and Trump's calendar. – Aysha Bagchi Pecker testimony ends with Trump lawyer's attempt to focus on family, not 2016 election Trump lawyer Emil Bove ended his re-cross-examination of David Pecker by asking Pecker to confirm he knows Trump cares about people, including his family. Pecker said he understands that. Bove then asked Pecker to confirm he understands that things discussed at this trial — presumably hush money to women who allege they had affairs with Trump — were stressful when it came to the Trump family. Before Pecker could answer, Judge Merchan sustained an objection from the prosecution. The nature of the objection wasn't explained, but it may have been an objection to speculation from a witness. – Aysha Bagchi Trump lawyer conducting cross-examination of Pecker again Trump lawyer Emil Bove is asking Pecker questions again in his opportunity to conduct re-cross-examination. – Aysha Bagchi Pecker re-direct ends with comment on truthfulness Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass ended his re-direct questioning of Pecker – an opportunity to question a witness again after cross-examination – by asking Pecker if anyone from the New York Attorney General's office ever told him to be anything other than truthful. Pecker said he was told to be truthful on any question he is asked. ""And only be truthful,"" Pecker added. Just before that question, Steinglass was pointing Pecker to past statements in order to establish Pecker has been consistent over time on many statements. – Aysha Bagchi Trump's eyes closed extensively although he appears awake Former President Donald Trump has his eyes closed for very extensive periods as Pecker continues to testify this afternoon, although Trump appears to be awake. I just counted to 107, with the word ""Mississippi"" in between each number, until Trump opened his eyes at all. He opened them only briefly. Occasionally, Trump is shifting his head left or right, or giving a slight facial expression that appears to react to Pecker's testimony. His eyes are still closed. – Aysha Bagchi Pecker says he first learned phrase, ""catch and kill,"" from press When Trump lawyer Emil Bove was cross-examining Pecker, Bove suggested Pecker learned of the phrase ""catch and kill"" from the investigative or prosecuting work behind this case. But prosecutor Joshua Steinglass noted a news article that Pecker was aware of that used the phrase. Pecker then said he first learned the phrase from the press. – Aysha Bagchi Trump re-enters courtroom ahead of afternoon witness testimony Former President Donald Trump re-entered the courtroom at 2:12 p.m. EST, following the lunch break. Prosecution witness David Pecker is set to re-take the stand soon. – Aysha Bagchi Who is Karen McDougal? Karen McDougal is a former Playboy model. National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc. (AMI) paid McDougal $150,000 in 2016 for the rights to her life story, including an alleged 10-month affair with Donald Trump starting in 2006. (Trump denies the allegation.) Former Trump lawyer and convicted felon Michael Cohen negotiated the payment she received as part of a ""catch and kill"" strategy to block negative stories about Trump while he ran for president. She is expected to take the stand, though the prosecutors have not shared the official witness list. Who is Judge Juan Merchan? New York Judge Juan Merchan who is presiding the first criminal trial in history of a former president, is no stranger to the defendant, Donald Trump. Merchan presided over a 2022 tax-fraud trial of two parts of the Trump Organization, in which the company’s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, was convicted for not reporting $1.7 million in benefits, and he sentenced Weisselberg to five months in jail. Trump has attacked Merchan as biased on the grounds that Merchan's daughter works for a marketing firm with Democratic politicians as clients, and he has twice unsuccessfully moved for Merchan to recuse himself from the case. Merchan has refused, citing the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics finding that the judge's impartiality couldn't be reasonably questioned based on his daughter's work. Trump's attacks spurred Merchan to expand a gag order to limit his commentary about the family members of people involved in the trial. On the second day of the trial, Merchan chastised Trump for speaking to prospective jurors. Merchan has been a felony judge for 15 years. -Bart Jansen Court breaks for lunch Judge Juan Merchan halted proceedings for a lunch break. Trump exited the courtroom at 1:01 p.m. EST. – Aysha Bagchi Pecker agrees Karen McDougal's story would have sold magazines Pecker confirmed in response to Steinglass's questioning that, had he published a story that a Playboy model had an affair with a presidential candidate while the candidate was married, it would have sold magazines. Pecker seemed to have a slight chuckle in his throat as he confirmed that. – Aysha Bagchi Steinglass trying to show actions weren't normal for tabloid company, were for Trump campaign Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass has been trying to push back on Trump lawyer Emil Bove's effort to distance Pecker's actions from Trump and the Trump campaign. In response to questions from Steinglass, Pecker confirmed it wasn't standard operating procedure for AMI – the National Enquirer's parent company – to be communicating with a presidential candidate's fixer about amendments to an agreement. Pecker also confirmed this was the only time he coordinated with a campaign, and that he ran more attack articles against Trump's opponents when their polling numbers rose. Pecker did say he didn't run negative Trump stories in earlier times because he and Trump were friends. But he agreed with Steinglass that, before the agreement at Trump Tower with Trump and Cohen in August of 2015, AMI never agreed to be the ""eyes and ears"" of the Trump campaign. – Aysha Bagchi Read the AMI contract with Karen McDougal McDougal contract left out a lot of details, Pecker confirms Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass has been going over the contract between Karen McDougal and National Enquirer parent company AMI, which Trump lawyer Emil Bove also asked David Pecker about. Pecker said the lawyer who reviewed the contract only billed for 30 minutes of work. Pecker also confirmed the contract didn't mention anything about Trump reimbursing Pecker, about a plan to re-assign the rights over McDougal's story to Trump or Michael Cohen, or about the alleged agreement between Pecker, Cohen, and Trump to catch and kill stories in order to help the Trump 2016 campaign. – Aysha Bagchi Cross-examination of Pecker ends Trump lawyer Emil Bove ended his cross-examination of David Pecker, the prosecution's first witness. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass is now asking Pecker questions again. – Aysha Bagchi AMI didn't admit to a campaign violation in conciliation agreement, Pecker confirms on cross-examination Trump lawyer Emil Bove suggested that Pecker testified inaccurately yesterday by saying the National Enquirer's parent company, AMI, admitted to a campaign violation. In a conciliation agreement, AMI said it wasn't contesting that its arrangement when it came to buying former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story of an affair with Trump constituted a prohibited corporate campaign contribution. Bove pointed Pecker to this language in the agreement: ""Solely for the purpose of settling this matter expeditiously and avoiding litigation, with no admission as to the merit of the Commission’s legal conclusions..."" That language came before specific details on the agreement. ""That's different from an admission, right?"" Bove asked Pecker. ""Yes,"" Pecker responded. – Aysha Bagchi Why is Trump lawyer Bove asking about campaign violations? Trump lawyer Emil Bove got prosecution witness David Pecker to confirm that the National Enquirer's parent company didn't admit to a campaign violation in a non-prosecution agreement Pecker signed. The company did pay a $187,500 civil penalty as part of a separate agreement not to contest having committed a violation. It's an important issue for the defense because, in order for Trump to be convicted on the felony charges, prosecutors have to prove Trump not only falsified business records, but also that he did so to commit or conceal another crime. One of the prosecution's theories is that Trump was trying to conceal that he violated federal campaign finance laws by making a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels via his attorney Michael Cohen to benefit his campaign. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to a violation of federal campaign contribution limits for making the payment. – Aysha Bagchi Pecker confirms AMI didn't admit to campaign violation in non-prosecution agreement Trump lawyer Emil Bove got David Pecker to say American Media Inc., the parent company to the National Enquirer, didn't admit to a campaign violation in its non-prosecution agreement with prosecutors. In that agreement, the company and its representatives were promised they wouldn't be prosecuted for a campaign violation if they cooperated and gave truthful testimony and information. However, Pecker also described yesterday a separate conciliation agreement between the company and prosecutors, in which the company agreed not to contest that it committed a campaign violation. As part of that agreement, AMI agreed to pay a $187,500 civil penalty to the Federal Election Commission. – Aysha Bagchi, Bart Jansen More: Donald Trump's strange split-screen moment: SCOTUS immunity case and hush money trial clash Bove suggesting Pecker has been under pressure Trump lawyer Emil Bove appears to be trying to establish David Pecker has been pressured by law enforcement investigative work. Bove had Pecker describe being visited by FBI agents, and then asked about pressure on Pecker at later meetings with investigators, although Pecker said he had legal representation and felt okay. Bove also got Pecker to confirm that American Media Inc's non-prosecution agreement gave the company helpful protection as a business. – Aysha Bagchi Pecker describes 2018 FBI visit to home Trump lawyer asked Pecker about his interactions with the FBI. Pecker said three FBI agents visited his home on April 9, 2018. They didn't search his house, but they took his phone. – Aysha Bagchi Proceedings re-start Trump lawyer Emil Bove's cross-examination of David Pecker started again at 11:35 a.m. EST, after a short morning break. – Aysha Bagchi Who is Michael Cohen? Michael Cohen is the longtime lawyer and political fixer for Trump, but he has become an open critic of him in recent years. In 2016, Cohen paid $280,000 to silence two women who claimed to have affairs with Trump in 2006. ""Everything was done with the knowledge and at the direction of Mr. Trump,"" Cohen said at a House hearing. David Pecker, the first witness on the stand for the hush money trial, has testified he frequently communicated with Cohen about stories regarding Trump and his opponents leading up to the 2016 election. −Kinsey Crowley Court taking a short break The judge announced a short morning break. After jurors exited, Trump lawyer Emil Bove said he thinks he has less than an hour of cross-examination left. The prosecution may choose to ask David Pecker some further questions after the cross-examination. Trump exited the courtroom at 11:15 a.m. EST. – Aysha Bagchi Pecker sounds meek as he responds to cross-examination Trump lawyer Emil Bove's tone on cross-examination isn't exactly friendly, but it also isn't terribly aggressive. David Pecker is largely agreeing to every point Bove tries to make, which have largely focuses on distancing Trump from the actions of Pecker and the media companies Pecker was running. Still, Pecker has sounded strikingly meek in the tone of his answers today, sometimes almost as if he is mumbling. He testified yesterday that he still considers Trump a friend. He is now testifying against that ""friend"" about details he shared with prosecutors under an agreement to protect the company he used to run, American Media Inc., from prosecution. – Aysha Bagchi Trump trial transcripts available online New York courts announced Monday it would publish the trial transcripts and copies of the evidence shown to the jury. Transcripts of proceedings aren't always available, but officials decided to make them available due to ""unparalleled public interest."" Monday and Tuesday's proceedings are currently available on the New York State Unified Court System's media website. Evidence shown to the jury, including texts, emails and photos, are also available from Tuesday's and Thursday's proceedings. −Kinsey Crowley What is AMI? American Media Inc. (AMI) is the parent company of the tabloid National Enquirer. David Pecker, the first witness called in the trial, was the CEO and President of AMI when he met with Trump and Michael Cohen to talk about how the publication could help Trump's first presidential campaign. The National Enquirer bought Karen McDougal's life story but refused to pay for Stormy Daniels', Pecker testified Thursday. −Kinsey Crowley Who is Emil Bove? Emil Bove is one of Trump's lawyers, part of the criminal defense team along with Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles. He is cross-examining the first witness, David Pecker. Bove is a former federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. “Emil is an expert in white collar and CIPA-related litigation and his trial skills are among the best in the business,” Blanche said in a statement provided to Politico. Trump eyes closed for extended period Trump's eyes have been closed for an extended period during Pecker's testimony, even though he doesn't appear to be actually asleep this morning. Trump's eyes were closed as I counted to 40 with the word ""Mississippi"" in between each number. In general, I've seen Trump's eyes closed for extended periods especially during the mornings of the trial. I saw him struggling to stay awake last Friday, April 19 – with his head repeatedly dropping and his mouth at one point agape. Other reporters have also seen him appear sleepy in the courtroom. – Aysha Bagchi Trump Media stock price At open on April 26, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. shares rose to $40, up 3.92% from the previous close. --Kinsey Crowley Pecker confirms desire for Sajudin story was self-interested Trump lawyer Emil Bove got Pecker to confirm that walking away from Dino Sajudin's story wouldn't have made business sense to Pecker's media company, American Media Inc. (AMI). AMI paid Sajudin $30,000 for the story that Trump fathered a child with a housekeeper. The company later concluded the story was false. ""It would be too great a loss to AMI"" to lose to lose control of the story if it were true, ""right?"" Emil Bove asked. Pecker said yes. – Aysha Bagchi Bove suggests public knew Pecker was helping Trump before 2016 election Trump lawyer Emil Bove displayed to the jury a portion of a Wall Street Journal article that ran days before the 2016 presidential election. The portion states: ""Since last year, the Enquirer has supported Mr. Trump’s presidential bid, endorsing him and publishing negative articles about some of his opponents."" Bove got Pecker to confirm that statement showed the Enquirer's support for the 2016 Trump campaign was publicly known prior to the election. – Aysha Bagchi Bove trying to distance Trump from Pecker's actions? Trump lawyer Emil Bove has gotten David Pecker to confirm the National Enquirer was already running stories about Bill and Hillary Clinton before the August, 2015 meeting Pecker has already described about assisting the Trump 2016 campaign through The National Enquirer's coverage. Pecker also confirmed that The Guardian published an article in May of 2015 about several malpractice suits against Dr. Ben Carson, who was a political opponent of Trump's in the Republican primaries ahead of the 2016 election. Pecker confirms having recycled photos from that article in The National Enquirer's own coverage of the malpractice suits. The questions may be aimed at suggesting to the jury that Pecker's coverage of political issues wasn't shaped by Trump. – Aysha Bagchi Trump lawyer asks about Hope Hicks presence in Trump Tower meeting Trump defense lawyer Emil Bove started his cross-examination for today by asking David Pecker about Hope Hicks' presence at an August, 2015 meeting at Trump Tower. Hicks was the Trump campaign's communications director for the 2016 election, and also held high-level roles in Trump's White House. Pecker previously testified that he, Michael Cohen, and Trump agreed to a scheme at the Trump Tower meeting to catch and kill stories that could hurt the 2016 Trump campaign. In response to Bove, Pecker confirmed Hicks was in and out of the Trump Tower meeting. Pecker also confirmed he doesn't remember Hicks speaking during that meeting. – Aysha Bagchi Jurors enter courtroom, instructed on witness-prosecutor meetings The jurors entered the courtroom at 9:41 a.m. EST. Witness David Pecker entered about a minute earlier. Judge Merchan just briefly instructed jurors on how it's normal for prosecutors to meet with witnesses ahead of trial. Trump lawyer Emil Bove questioned Pecker yesterday about having met with prosecutors several times before his current testimony. – Aysha Bagchi Trump now says he will testify 'if it's necessary' The former president is starting to equivocate on whether he will testify in the hush money trial. ""I would if it's necessary,"" Trump said a telephone interview Thursday with Newsmax. Trump, who once said he would take the stand, told Newsmax television that ""there is no case,"" suggesting that he might not testify after all. -David Jackson Trump wishes wife Melania ‘happy birthday’ from hush money trial Former President Donald Trump wished his wife Melania a happy birthday Friday while complaining about being stuck at his New York hush money trial for allegedly hiding payments to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels, who claimed she had sex with him while he was married. “I want to start by wishing my wife Melania a very happy birthday. It would be nice to be with her, but I’m in a courthouse for a rigged trial.” Trump said he would join his wife in Florida after the trial wrapped up for the day. --Bart Jansen Judge Merchan arrives in courtroom Judge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom right at the 9:30 a.m. EST start time. As usual, he said a general good morning to the trial teams and a specific ""Good morning, Mr. Trump"" to Trump. Merchan also announced that a hearing over alleged gag order violations by Trump will be held next Thursday at 9:30 a.m. EST – Aysha Bagchi Trump arrives in the courtroom Former President Donald Trump entered the courtroom for Day 8 of his criminal trial at 9:26 a.m. ET. We are still waiting for the judge. – Aysha Bagchi Prosecution team arrives for Day 8 of trial The lead trial prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office arrived in the courtroom at 9:18 a.m. EST. We are still waiting for the defense team and the judge. – Aysha Bagchi Today is Melania Trump's birthday. Where is she? Melania Trump turns 54 today. She hasn't attended any of her husband's criminal trial so far. Melania Trump was furious when she first learned of reports in early 2018 that her husband paid off porn star Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about an alleged affair, according to The New York Times. She left Washington for Florida, and when she returned for her husband's State of the Union address, she took a separate car. If she were at the trial, she would likely be spared some embarrassing testimony. Judge Juan Merchan issued a tentative ruling last week that Melania Trump's pregnancy during an alleged affair between former Playboy model Karen McDougal and Trump can't be shared with the jury. McDougal also received a hush money payment. Trump denies the affairs with both McDougal and Daniels. – Aysha Bagchi Who is David Pecker, first witness in Trump trial? David Pecker, the former head of the National Enquirer’s parent company, wraps up a week of testimony Friday as the first witness in Donald Trump’s hush money trial. Pecker, 72, the former CEO of American Media Inc., described himself as a friend of Trump’s from the 1980s until 2018, in the aftermath of revelations about the company paying to silence derogatory stories about Trump as he ran for president the first time. Pecker testified the first payment was $30,000 to a doorman at Trump Tower who was peddling a story that never ran about Trump having an illegitimate child – even though Pecker knew it was “absolutely 1,000% false.” Pecker also testified about paying $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for a story that never ran. McDougal claimed a year-long affair with Trump in about 2006, while he was married. Trump denied the affair. But as Pecker coordinated with Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, he refused to pay $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had sex with Trump. Cohen has testified he arranged the payment himself. Trump is charged with falsifying business business records to hide his reimbursement to Cohen for Daniels. Trump pleaded not guilty and says he didn’t know about paying off the women. --Bart Jansen What is Trump on trial for? Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office allege Trump falsified the purpose of checks to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, in order to conceal a conspiracy to unlawfully interfere in the 2016 presidential election through a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty, and also denies Daniels' claim that the pair had sex in 2006. – Aysha Bagchi What happens if Trump is found guilty? Some legal experts believe Trump could face jail or prison time if convicted on all 34 counts, while others believe he would likely only receive probation. Several experts told USA TODAY they would expect a sentence that ranges from no jail time to up to four years in prison. No one predicted Trump would be forced to serve an incarceration sentence before his appeal ran out. Each felony count carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison, but New York caps such sentencing for these types of felonies – known as Class E felonies – at 20 years. – Aysha

Trump trial live: First week of testimony concludes as jury hears about ties to Stormy Daniels - Yahoo News Canada,Trump trial live: First week of testimony concludes as jury hears about ties to Stormy Daniels  Yahoo News Canada,"Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:35:32 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdHJ1bXAtYnJhbmRlZC1wdXRpbi1idWRkeS12aWxlbmVzcy0xNjEwMTc0MjYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo News Canada,"Donald Trump returned to court for the latest instalment of his New Yorkhush money trial on Frida, where the jury heard further testimony from tabloid mogul David Pecker who detailed the “catch-and-kill” scheme to suppress stories about the defendant’s alleged affairs. The former National Enquirer publisher doubled down on his testimony that he bought and silenced the story of Playboy model Karen McDougal’s affair with Mr Trump to influence the 2016 election. With cross-examination complete, the court then heard from Trump executive assistant Rhona Graff and Guy Farro of First Republic Bank who set up a wire transfer to Stormy Daniels. Justice Juan Merchan is yet to rule on whether Mr Trump should be held in contempt and fined $10,000 for allegedly violating a trial gag order by posting about witnesses and jurors on Truth Social. In other legal news, Supreme Court justices heard oral arguments concerning Mr Trump’s “presidential immunity” defence against prosecution in federal cases, and the former president had his latest efforts to overturn the E Jean Carroll defamation verdict against him dismissed. Alex Woodward is providing live updates from the courthouse in Manhattan. Key Points What to expect on day eight of Trump’s New York hush money trialSupreme Court justices appear poised to offer Trump some immunityTrump loses latest bid for new E Jean Carroll trialFormer president backs away from testifying over porn star payment 22:00 , Oliver O'Connell Oh wait, he invited himself to the White House to debate the president. Don’t hold your breath... Who’s going to tell him? 21:57 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump’s invitation to an impromptu courthouse debate after trial proceedings ended today sadly went unanswered... I’ve been waiting for Crooked Joe at the Courthouse, the Fake News Media was there also — HE DIDN’T SHOW! ANY WHERE, ANY TIME, ANY PLACE! After telling Howard Stern he would be happy to debate Mr Trump, the president returned to Washington, DC. Rooting for Trump to fail has made his stock shorters millions 21:45 , AP Rooting for Donald Trump to fail has rarely been this profitable. Just ask a hardy band of mostly amateur Wall Street investors who have collectively made tens of millions of dollars over the past month by betting that the stock price of his social media business — Truth Social — will keep dropping despite massive buying by Trump loyalists and wild swings that often mirror the candidate’s latest polls, court trials and outbursts on Trump Social itself. Several of these investors interviewed by The Associated Press say their bearish gambles using “put” options and other trading tools are driven less by their personal feelings about the former president (most don’t like him) than their faith in the woeful underlying financials of a company that made less money last year than the average Wendy’s hamburger franchise. Read on... 21:30 , Oliver O'Connell Cohen then applied for another LLC, Essential Consultants LLC, which was intended to “collect fees for investment consulting for real estate transactions,” according to a form. The prosecution says they're at a stopping point for today. Judge Merchan asks them to approach before excusing the jurors. “We'll call it a week.” 21:24 , Alex Woodward The LLC is Resolution Consultants LLC, the shell company that Cohen used to set up the McDougal transfer that Pecker ultimately backed out of. The type of business on the First Republic Bank form to set up the LLC is listed as “MANAGEMENT CONSULTING”. Cohen is the only listed officer for the LLC. Cohen signed off on it on 13 October 2016, two days after calling Farro's office to try to set it up. A question on the form asked “is the entity associated with political fundraising/political action committees?” The corresponding box was checked “no”. On the morning of October 26, Farro's assistant emailed Farro asking him to return Cohen's call. He did. “He said he was changing course, no longer wanted to open Resolution Consultants, and wanted to open a new account,” Farro says. “Every time Michael Cohen spoke to me he gave me a sense of urgency ... This was one of those times.” The account had never actually opened, because Cohen didn't pay for it, so there wasn't anything to do necessarily. Full story: Trump’s longtime assistant testifies to ‘vague’ memory of seeing Stormy Daniels at Trump Tower 21:10 , Oliver O'Connell Alex Woodward reports from the courthouse: A former longtime assistant to Donald Trump at his Trump Organization testified that she has a “vague recollection” of seeing adult film star Stormy Daniels at Trump Tower before his 2016 presidential campaign. Rhonna Graff, who worked at the Trump Organization for more than 30 years, testified on Friday at a criminal trial in Manhattan across from her former boss, who is charged with falsifying business records to cover up payments to Ms Daniels as part of a scheme to bury details of an alleged affair. She testified that she saw Ms Daniels in the lobby of the 26th floor of Trump Tower, where Mr Trump’s office is located. Continue reading... 21:09 , Alex Woodward An email in the morning from October 13 2016. The subject line is: FW: Message from ""26-Copier-Pantry"" There's a PDF attachment. Farro then emailed one of his coworkers about opening an account for Cohen “immediately”. 21:05 , Alex Woodward We see an email from October 11 2016 from Farro's assistant about a missed call from Michael Cohen. She sent another email two days later asking him to please return his call “regarding an important matter”. When he called back, Cohen said he wanted to open an LLC account. This was all roughly three weeks before election day. 21:01 , Alex Woodward Farro: ""Michael Cohen was assigned to me after a client left in 2015."" He said he believed he was given Cohen for “my knowledge and my ability to handle individuals who may be a little challenging”. “Michael did a lot of his own business and frankly I didn’t find him difficult,” he said. 20:59 , Oliver O'Connell Gary Farro is the next witness — the third of the trial — and was formerly a senior managing director at First Republic Bank. He says he's here voluntarily, but “I did receive a subpoena”. He now works at Flagstar Bank but worked at First Republic Bank for 15 years, beginning in 2002. It was there he allegedly set up the home equity line of credit through which Michael Cohen paid Stormy Daniels. Kirsti Noem makes shocking admission she shot pet dog she 'hated' 20:38 , Oliver O'Connell Mike Bedigan reports: One of the candidates in the running to be Donald Trump’s pick for Vice President has admitted that she once shot a pet puppy that she “hated”. Kristi Noem wrote about an incident with the dog, named Cricket, who she called “untrainable” and “less than worthless”. She also claimed to have put down an unnamed, family-owned goat because he was “nasty and mean”. Ms Noem, the Governor of South Dakota is seen as a leading contender to be Mr Trump’s running mate for the November presidential election. Yikes... 20:20 , Alex Woodward We see an email from Graff to Madeleine Westerhout at the White House on April 6 2017: Here is the Fed Ex label you requested. Hope it works ; ) Necheles asks: The only reason you’re testifying here today is because you worked at the Trump Organization? Yes. You don’t want to be here, do you? ""Correct."" Lawyers are expensive, aren’t they? ""I haven’t seen the bills but I assume they are."" The Trump Organization is paying bills for all employees? Yes. Is the payment of your legal fees conditioned on how you testify? No. No one from the Trump Organization has told you how to testify? No. No further questions and no follow-ups from the prosecution. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche asks for a sidebar. The celebrities dragged into Trump’s hush money trial 20:15 , Oliver O'Connell A string of famous names have been dragged into Donald Trump’s historic criminal trial, after four days of testimony from the former publisher of the supermarket tabloid The National Enquirer. David Pecker became the first witness to take the stand in the former president’s New York hush money trial this week, laying out a so-called “catch-and-kill” scheme at the centre of the case. Joe Sommerlad has the story... 20:14 , Alex Woodward Graff agrees with Necheles that Trump “was actively involved” with The Apprentice, and that part of her job duties was to work with the show's producers. “He was very hands-on, yes. … At the time it was probably the most popular TV show,” she says. The series elevated him to “a whole other platform from being a businessman to … rock star status.” Graff says she has some memory of Trump saying he thought Stormy might be a “good contestant” on the show. “I can't remember a specific incident when I heard it. It was part of the office chatter.” 20:13 , Alex Woodward Susan Necheles is now cross-examining Graff. What was it like working for Trump? I never had to do the same day twice. It was a very stimulating, exciting ... place to be. Was he a good boss? “I think he was fair, and what’s the word I’m looking for ... Respectful to me.” Did he respect your intelligence? “I don’t think I would have been there 34 years if he didn’t.” What was a typical day? “There was no typical day. I would usually get there early in the morning … see what was on the calendar and see what was happening … Those kinds of things.” 20:11 , Alex Woodward After establishing the Trump Organization protocols for keeping and maintaining contact information and managing email communications, Hoffinger gets down to more pertinent questions. We see an entry for Karen McDougal's contact information (including a Yahoo email account). And another for Stormy Daniels, which includes her phone number. The name is simply ""Stormy."" Graff has a ""vague recollection"" of seeing Stormy Daniels in the reception area at Trump Tower. She knew she was an adult film actress. We see a few appointment calendar entries for Jan 17 and Jan 18 2017, a few days before Trump was inaugurated. He had an interview with Ainsley Erhardt, a couple of teleprompter practice sessions, and a meeting with “Mike Allen - per Hope” for a photo shoot with The Washington Post in the lobby area of the 25th floor. He also had his ""Wheels Up"" time at LGA on Jan 19, one day before the inauguration. ...and that’s it for the prosecution. New witness: Rhona Graff 19:46 , Oliver O'Connell Rhona Graff is Donald Trump’s former long-time executive assistant, dubbed his “gatekeeper”. She's on the stand wearing a black t-shirt and black cardigan with a large turquoise amulet. Prosecution attorney Susan Hoffinger is up to begin questioning Graff. She spent 37 years at the Trump Organization, first as an executive assistant all the way up to senior vice president. Mr Trump was her boss. Trump’s attorneys try to pick holes in David Pecker’s ‘catch and kill’ testimony 19:45 , Oliver O'Connell Alex Woodward reports from the courthouse: Donald Trump’s defence attorneys have tried to undermine trial testimony from one of the alleged architects of a scheme to buy up politically damaging stories to boost Mr Trump’s 2016 election chances. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, the first witness in the historic trial in a Manhattan courtroom, answered a barrage of “yes” or “no” questions from Mr Trump’s lawyer Emil Bove on Thursday and Friday, hoping to poke holes in his week-long testimony that the former president and his then-attorney Michael Cohen conspired with him to influence the election. At one point on Friday, Mr Bove tried to get Mr Pecker to admit that he either lied on the witness stand or to federal law enforcement about Mr Trump “thanking” him for his help burying stories of Mr Trump’s alleged affairs. Continue reading... 19:44 , Alex Woodward Bove mentions the anthrax incident at the AMI office in Florida, and how Pecker testified that Trump was one of the first people to reach out. “Trump was one of the first people to reach out to see if you’re OK,” Bove says. “You know he cares about people. ... He cares about his family. ... And you know that, right?” Bove says. “The types of stories you’re talking about today and in 2016 were things that were stressful.” Pecker agrees. Bove has no further questions and Pecker can step down. Re-cross-examination of Pecker by Bove 19:43 , Alex Woodward Trump defence attorney Emil Bove is now re-cross-examining David Pecker. Bove, again asking yes or no questions only, asked Pecker whether having McDougal around at AMI would be a boost to the company because of her “celebrity” and brand value. The overflow crowd burst out laughing. Pecker fumbled around a bit before answering. “Did she meet the celebrity category at that time? Uh, no.” 19:32 , Alex Woodward Despite just getting back down to business, Trump's eyes appear to be closed again. It almost looks meditative. Like he's listening harder. Steinglass reads from a federal law enforcement summary of Pecker's summary of his January 6 2017 meeting at Trump Tower. Bove had tried to suggest Pecker was lying when he said that Trump thanked him for handling the McDougal and doorman stories. Steinglass: “Did you in fact tell the FBI that the defendant thanked you for the Karen McDougal story and Dino Sajudin story?” Yes. “Was that the truth then?” Yes. “Was that the truth now?” Yes. “Do you believe you have ever been inconsistent on that point?” No. Court resumes as redirect questioning of Pecker continues 19:23 , Oliver O'Connell Court has returned from lunch with David Pecker being questioned on redirect by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass. Alex Woodward is reporting live for The Independent from the courthouse. ‘The King of Pettiness' 19:15 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump has had many nicknames throughout the years, from giving himself the moniker ‘very stable genius’ to the more recent ‘Sleepy Don’ – coined by social media users reacting to him apparently during the first day of the ongoing hush money trial. However, The Daily Show’s Jordan Klepper has bestowed a new nickname upon the former president as the “king of pettiness” after Trump’s latest Truth Social rant, launched at former attorney general Bill Barr. Amelia Neath has the story: ‘Let’s do it tonight’ Trump fumes as Biden says he’ll debate him 18:53 , Oliver O'Connell In a live radio interview this morning, President Joe Biden said he would be “happy” to debate former president and current criminal defendant Donald Trump as part of the 2024 presidential election campaign. Mr Trump couldn’t let that go and — much like when he says he will testify in his trials — accused the president of not really meaning it. While Mr Biden has the actual presidential debates in mind that traditionally come in the fall, the former president began suggesting evenings next week, and even tonight at the courthouse — not sure those optics would work in Mr Trump’s favour.... Here’s what he wrote on Truth Social: Crooked Joe Biden just announced that he’s willing to debate! Everyone knows he doesn’t really mean it, but in case he does, I say, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, ANYPLACE, an old expression used by Fighters. I suggest Monday Evening, Tuesday Evening, or Wednesday Evening at my Rally in Michigan, a State that he is in the process of destroying with his E.V. Mandate. In the alternative, he’s in New York City today, although probably doesn’t know it, and so am I, stuck in one of the many Court cases that he instigated as ELECTION INTERFERENCE AGAINST A POLITICAL OPPONENT - A CONTINUING WITCH HUNT! It’s the only way he thinks he can win. In fact, let’s do the Debate at the Courthouse tonight - on National Television, I’ll wait around! There is no evidence that President Joe Biden has in any way orchestrated any of the civil or criminal indictments against Mr Trump. The federal cases were handed off to Special Counsel Jack Smith by the Department of Justice to avoid any possible influence by the administration. The state and local cases are beyond the remit of the federal government. All four criminal cases were presented to grand juries of US citizens who recommended that charges be brought. In pictures: This morning in court 18:30 , Oliver O'Connell Redirect questioning of Pecker in one image 18:20 , Oliver O'Connell Courtesy of MSNBC: Court breaks for lunch 18:04 , Alex Woodward The jury has been excused for lunch. Steinglass has half an hour to go on redirect. Bove wants to re-cross Pecker. Todd Blanche also asks for the name of the next witness. The judge will come back to that after lunch. 18:01 , Alex Woodward Steinglass: “Had you published a story about a Playboy model having a yearlong sexual affair while he was married … would that have sold magazines? … That would be like, National Enquirer gold. … At the time you entered into that agreement, you had zero intention of publishing that story. … You killed the story because it helped candidate Donald Trump.” Pecker: “Yes.” 17:58 , Alex Woodward Steinglass hammers home the main point the prosecution is trying to make and mentions prior AMI plans to suppress coverage in other stories. “In this case, did you suppress stories to help a presidential candidate?” “Yes.” Steinglass also points out that Pecker and AMI didn’t make similar arrangements with other political candidates to write certain stories, which Pecker admits was done in coordination with the campaign. Pecker, revisiting the Trump Tower meeting: “It was my understanding, I would use the company sources … for any information that would be coming out on Mr Trump or the campaign, related to — specifically — women, who would be selling their stories, similar to what I experienced with Schwarzenegger … My understanding is those stories would come up, I would speak to Michael Cohen, I would tell him that these stories are going to be for sale, and someone else would buy them if we don’t. … That was my understanding of that meeting.” 17:36 , Alex Woodward Pecker admits that the August 5 2016 contract does not mention Trump reimbursing him, Cohen, the plan to reassign life rights to Trump, nor the arrangement at Trump Tower. “Does the contract even mention the word campaign?” Steinglass asks. (No, it does not.) 17:30 , Alex Woodward Pecker confirms that the “true purpose” of the McDougal contract with to acquire the life rights of her story, and that the other parts of the agreement – columns, cover appearances, blog posts, ghostwriters, etc. – gave the deal “plausible deniability”. Pecker: “It was included in the contract basically as a disguise of what the actual purpose of it … The actual purpose of it was to acquire the lifetime rights … It would be published by American Media. It would not be published by any media source.” Redirect questioning of Pecker begins 17:27 , Alex Woodward Bove asks about Pecker’s testimony that Cohen was trying to get access to boxes with materials about Trump, out of concern that he would leave AMI. Bove suggests it’s because of his “job application” with Time. Pecker clarifies that in 2016, AMI was “looking to acquire all of Time.” He wasn’t applying for a job there. Pecker also confirms that the contents of those boxes was worthless. Bove wraps up, with a reminder in the form of a question about Pecker’s obligation to the truth, and that jurors will be the judge of that. Pecker: “I’ve been truthful to the best of my recollection.” That’s it for Bove. Redirect from prosecutor Joshua Steinglass. Biden ‘happy’ to debate Trump 17:20 , Oliver O'Connell President Joe Biden on Friday said he will participate in televised debates with his likely opponent, former president Donald Trump, before the 5 November presidential election. Mr Biden said he’d debate Mr Trump during an hour-long, wide-ranging interview with Sirius-XM radio host Howard Stern after Stern asked him whether he’d do so. Andrew Feinberg reports: 17:12 , Alex Woodward Bove asks about an October 2019 meeting with the District Attorney’s office, in which Bove suggests he described that paragraph 3 was “wrong and inaccurate”. Bove reads: “I think that may be inaccurate. I think that came up with the feds. I have never heard Pecker saying that.” “Do you remember that?” “No.” Pecker: “My testimony I gave, I offered at that meeting to be the eyes and ears … The stories, women would be selling them and I would offer them to Michael Cohen. Selling and purchasing here are synonymous. Someone has to buy them.” “Based on your experiences, Michael Cohen was prone to exaggeration?” Yes. “You could not trust everything he said?” Objection. Sidebar. This feels too close to an attempt to impeach another witness who hasn’t testified yet. Question answered 17:08 , Oliver O'Connell Yesterday, Donald Trump was sucking on some type of candy or lozenge he kept taking out of his jacket while seated in court. He sounded very hoarse at the end of the day. Today, Ben Kochman of The New York Post spotted what it was: 17:02 , Oliver O'Connell Here’s the paragraph of the non-prosecution agreement that is being focused on by Bove questions: 3. In or about August 2015, David Pecker, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMl, met with Michael Cohen, an attorney for a presidential candidate, and at least one other member of the campaign. At the meeting, Pecker offered to help deal with negative stories about that presidential candidate's relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided. Pecker agreed to keep Cohen apprised of any such negative stories. 16:55 , Alex Woodward “AMI’s assets are worth less to Hudson News Group if AMI is subject to federal investigation?” Pecker: “The investigation is not going to reduce the earnings of the company, of the magazines.” But what if AMI had been indicted? Bove asks. He hits the word indicted like it’s italicised. Pecker admits that yes that would’ve been an issue. The non-prosecution agreement is just that, however. It does not criminally charge AMI. “There’s no admission by AMI in this agreement of a campaign violation, correct?” Bove aks. Bove is focusing on a clause about the federal government prosecuting AMI for “false, incomplete or misleading testimony or information.” That “gives the federal government some options if it determines that AMI or its representatives give false or misleading testimony, right?” Court resumes 16:44 , Oliver O'Connell Alex Woodward is reporting for The Independent from the courthouse in Lower Manhattan: Pecker is recalling the FBI’s search of his phone in April 2018. Agents showed up at his home around 8am. He pushed back at Bove’s description of those meetings as “stressful” but admitted he wanted to get them over with. We’re looking at Pecker’s nonprosecution agreement with the Justice Department from September 2018, which Pecker testified about yesterday. Bove is suggesting that Pecker and AMI were under pressure from a deal for the company to get sold off to Hudson News Group. Asked by Bove whether that meant that AMI needed to get the investigations cleared up, Pecker pauses and says yes. “The federal investigation needed to get resolved before the deal could go through, correct?” Pecker, after a pause: “The transaction could’ve closed subject to the investigation being completed.” How does Trump interact with others in court? 16:33 , Oliver O'Connell Norm Eisen, legal analyst for CNN and senior fellow at the Brookings Governance, had an interesting interaction with the former president as the court went on its break... 16:18 , Oliver O'Connell Alex Woodward reports from the courtroom: Bove has less than an hour of cross-examination left. Then there’s some redirect. It’s highly likely that Pecker will be done today. I doubt we’ll get an idea who the next witness will be for Monday, but last time prosecutors gave the defence a heads-up the afternoon before. Thus far, Bove hasn’t done much if anything to undermine Pecker’s credibility, and Pecker’s description of events is consistent with his prior testimony. Jurors are only getting the defence’s perspective, not anything new about what happened. ‘I would if it’s necessary’: Trump seems to get cold feet about testifying in New York hush money trial 16:15 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump appears to be getting cold feet about taking the stand to testify in his criminal hush money trial, after he previously insisted that he would “absolutely” do so. The former president called in to Newsmax on Thursday night after the conclusion of day seven of his historic trial. Anchor Greg Kelly asked him about his intentions to testify in his own defence based on what he had seen of the proceedings so far. “Well I would if it’s necessary,” Mr Trump answered. Joe Sommerlad and Alex Woodward report on the former president apparently losing confidence... 16:15 , Alex Woodward “This is the FBI’s interview, is that correct? These are the FBI notes? The FBI notes, some of these here, are wrong. I know what I testified to yesterday,” says Pecker. Are you saying the FBI made a mistake here? “I know what the truth is. I can’t state why it’s written this way.” Bove: “Your testimony is inconsistent with what’s written here?” Steinglass, loudly: “Objection.” Morning recess. 15 minutes. 16:12 , Alex Woodward During that meeting on 6 January 2017, according to Pecker yesterday, Trump told him “I want to thank you for handling the McDougal situation” and “the doorman situation”. Bove: “Was that a mistake?” Pecker: “No.” Bove: “Do you believe Trump said that to you as we sit here right now?” Pecker: “Yes I do.” Bove reminds him about what prosecutors in other meetings have said about the importance of telling the truth, and how it could be criminal if he does not. He is reminded of a report from a meeting with law enforcement about the meeting that notes that “Trump did not express any gratitude towards Pecker and AMI.” “I don’t recall.” Bove shows the interview report to Pecker. He’s been scanning the document and can’t seem to find what Bove is telling him. 16:04 , Alex Woodward Questioning now turns to the topic of Stormy Daniels. “You did not authorise [editor Dylan] Howard to speak to Keith Davidson about Stormy Daniels?” Yes. What Howard did was “unauthorised and outside of his employment?” Steinglass objects. It’s sustained. When Howard told him that Michael Cohen has not paid Keith Davidson, “you were surprised to hear that” because you told him to “stay out of it” and you were “not happy.” Pecker agrees. “The main concern was Howard’s reputation,” Bove says. “The concern was Dylan Howard would look bad [if he doesn’t pay his sources] … And he said that to you.” “And so you and Howard called Cohen, said to Cohen, I want you to know I’m not paying or doing anything on this. And you meant it.” Pecker agrees. Bove is asking about the meeting that Pecker walked into with James Comey, Sean Spicer et al when he was being briefed on the Fort Lauderdale mass shooting. “You knew that after that meeting there were some issues between President Trump and James Comey, right?” There is an objection, a sidebar with Judge Merchan, and then the objection is sustained. 15:53 , Alex Woodward The court is now looking at the payment to McDougal. Bove asks whether everyone who signed on to this was following procedure, and that there were no “false entries.” Pecker agrees. “You didn’t do anything inappropriate when you consulted counsel [about McDougal]? … When you told Cohen the deal was ‘bulletproof’, you meant it because you had legal advice?” Yes. In reference to Keith Davidson [McDougal’s lawyer], Bove asks about him learning that Dylan Howard was “using a major attorney as a source”? Pecker: “I wouldn’t classify him as a major attorney.” Pecker says Howard was just one of “50, several other editors” at the time, and “they all have their own sources” and how they get stories. He’s suggesting there wasn’t anything unusual about that pipeline. The “major attorney” answer got a laugh in the overflow room. Pecker smirked a bit. 15:37 , Alex Woodward Bove turns to the agreement signed by Karen McDougal, focusing on the bulk of that arrangement, concerning her role working for AMI properties. “AMI told Ms McDougal that her promotion to AMI magazines would be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars?” Yes. “Running 65 stories with Ms McDougal’s name?” Yes. “When AMI signed this agreement … you believed it had a legitimate business purpose, correct?” Yes. Yesterday, Pecker said he included those roles to “substantiate the $150,000 payment” to buy the rights to her story: “With respect to campaign, uh, laws, I wanted to have the contract be a record that stipulates that – for the services that she was going to perform for American Media – has a basis for it.” 15:32 , Alex Woodward Bove recalls Cohen trying to get a job with Mark Cuban in summer 2016, and Cohen calling on Pecker for a “little help” to arrange paparazzi to cover a meeting between them. Publishing those photos would “put pressure on Trump to treat Cohen differently” Bove says. “Michael Cohen never said that to me,” Pecker says. He admits that it could’ve looked that way. ‘Six or seven’ Trump supporters outside court 15:30 , Oliver O'Connell Media reporter Brian Stelter says on CNN that six or seven Trump supporters are outside the courthouse, some attempting to sell merchandise. 15:24 , Alex Woodward Pecker recalls Trump calling him in June 2016, which he previously recounted earlier this week. “Mr Trump called my office … Since I was in Chatham, New Jersey, my assistant transferred the call to Chatham. When the call came in, the assistant in the office, a small office, came over and told me President Trump was on the phone.” “When I spoke to Mr Trump, he wanted to know, he asked me, I spoke to Michael [Cohen], and I want to talk to you about Karen McDougal. So he said, Is it true there’s a Mexican group looking to buy the story for $8m? I said no, I don’t believe that’s true. Two, he said that [long pause] I’m recollecting completely. He said that [pause] I said that this story about Karen, since she’s claiming she had a relationship with you, should be taken off the market. Mr Trump said I don’t buy stories because it always gets out. I said I still think you should buy the story. Mr Trump said I’ll speak to Michael and get back to you.” One note: when Bove introduced McDougal, he was trying to get Pecker to admit that he knew about her because she was once a cover model for AMI property Men’s Fitness. But Pecker said they never met. He didn’t know her. 15:22 , Alex Woodward Cross-examination moves on to discussing Karen McDougal. Bove tells Pecker that McDougal didn’t want to publish her story but rather restart her career at AMI. Pecker agrees. “Her main interest was not publishing this story,” Bove asks. Pecker agrees. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass has been trying to object to Bove calling Trump “President Trump” referencing periods when he was not the president. “He wasn’t president in June 2016,” Steinglass says partially off-mic, laughing in frustration. 15:18 , Alex Woodward Questioning moves on to Dino Sajudin, the Trump World Tower doorman who had a false story about Donald Trump fathering an illegitimate child with a housekeeper. Pecker confirms that he never talked about it with Trump. We’re looking at the AMI contract with Dino for $30,000 to buy the rights to his story. Bove reminds Pecker that he previously testified that, if the story was true and he ran it, it would sell 10 million copies and be a bigger story than the death of Elvis. “At some point when this agreement was signed and the vetting process was completed, Sajudin was starting to make threats [to] go somewhere else, that’s why you paid him $30,000, right?” Yes. “You couldn’t have him going to another publication if that was true, right?” We’re looking at the contract amendment. Bove says it was “still possible” in Pecker’s mind that the story was true, and Pecker “couldn’t walk away.” Pecker agrees. 15:07 , Alex Woodward In another example, an Enquirer headline read: BEN CARSON ‘LIES’ OVER MILITARY & VIOLENT PAST. Bover notes that the story had been run by Politico days earlier. Bove’s line of questioning is trying to make the Enquirer look as if it was merely republishing other outlets, not singularly scheming to boost negative stories about Trump. “With substantially everything in the exhibits you were shown … The National Enquirer was recycling content from other publications because it was cost-efficient and it made business sense?” “Yes,” says Pecker. 15:03 , Alex Woodward Bove is trying to suggest that Pecker’s agreement with Trump and Cohen in 2015 was already in line with what The National Enquirer was doing, and not evidence of a conspiracy. Again — as yesterday — he’s framing every single question as a yes or no. “It made sense for the business to run articles about Bill and Hillary Clinton … Those articles were negative, right? … It’s easy to say that you would continue to do that during that August 2015 meeting, right? … Running those stories was beneficial to AMI, right? … Doing what’s good for AMI was standard operating procedure, right?” “There wasn’t much new content in those stories, was there,” regarding negative stories of Trump’s opponents Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz. “It was standard operating procedure for The National Enquirer to recycle content from other publications and frame it slightly differently, right?” Bove gives the example that The Guardian had already run articles about Carson’s malpractice before the Enquirer ran headlines about Carson leaving sponges in peoples’ brains. 14:54 , Alex Woodward Pecker is reading through a transcript in a defence exhibit of his testimony to a federal grand jury in 2018 about the fateful Trump Tower meeting in 2015. Basically, Bove is trying to pin down the fact that Pecker didn’t bring up Hope Hicks in that meeting with the feds, yet later said that she was in and out of that meeting in some capacity. Also, Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn is here in the court — as he was yesterday — in the same seat two rows behind Trump, one row behind the Secret Service. 14:49 , Alex Woodward Bove’s whole schtick yesterday just got sunk by Merchan. Merchan instructs the jury that there’s nothing weird about prosecutors speaking with witnesses before a trial. “The law permits the witness to do so,” he said. “Speaking to a witness about his or her testimony, reading materials, is a normal part of preparing for trial. It is not improper, as long as the witness does not depart from the truth.” Before getting back to Hope Hicks questions, Bove tells Pecker: “I want to apologize and move on from that.” 14:43 , Alex Woodward Assistant district attorney for Manhattan Joshua Steinglass raised a couple of issues, including the defence’s “improper impeachment” of tabloid mogul David Pecker on the stand yesterday, and defence attorney Emil Bove’s conflation of state and federal prosecutors – both of which made things (intentionally) unclear to the jury, in what seemed like an obvious attempt to derail his testimony and make him look unreliable. Pecker returns to the witness stand, for likely his last day in court (for now), and the jury is walking in. Where are Trump’s supporters? 14:41 , Oliver O'Connell Busy at work, presumably? Court resumes 14:38 , Oliver O'Connell Judge Juan Merchan is on the bench and addresses a couple of issues before the cross-examination of David Pecker resumes before the jury. He says that next week’s gag order hearing will be on Thursday at 9:30am. That’s the gag order violations hearing on the other four new allegations of contempt of court that popped up this week alone. He is yet to rule on the first 10 instances. The Independent’s Alex Woodward is reporting from inside the courtroom... Watch: Trump’s courthouse remarks in full 14:35 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump claims yesterday in court went “very well” and the case should “be over” if it weren’t for the “highly-conflicted” judge. The former president also remarked about his Supreme Court argument on presidential immunity and the “freezing courtroom”. Trump wishes Melania a happy birthday 14:31 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump begins his daily remarks to the media by wishing his wife Melania a happy birthday, saying he will join her down in Florida this evening. The former president says he would be with her if it weren’t for his trial. No Trump family members have attended the trial so far but are free to do so... Trump again claims his supporters can’t get to courthouse 14:27 , Oliver O'Connell And yet people protesting against him don’t seem to have a problem getting there? Rooting for Trump to fail has made his stock shorters millions 14:15 , Joe Sommerlad Here’s the latest on Trump Media and Technology, parent company of Truth Social, whose share price has fluctuated pretty wildly since its recent launch on the Nasdaq exchange but which is at least earning someone a few bucks. MAGA conspiracy blog files for bankruptcy amid defamation lawsuits 14:00 , Joe Sommerlad Bad news for MAGA as the popular conservative blog Gateway Pundit is filing for bankruptcy amid a string of defamation lawsuits it is facing. Launched in 2004, the site has been a hotbed of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, school shootings and other topics since its founding and has staunchly promoted by Trump and his allies. The site was even granted White House press credentials during his administration. But its peddling of conspiracy theories has landed the blog in hot water in recent years and it is now facing a string of lawsuits alleging it promoted bogus claims about the 2020 election. In a message posted on the site on Wednesday, the blog’s founder, Jim Hoft, said the outlet had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection “as a result of the progressive liberal lawfare attacks” and that this was “not an admission of fault or culpability”. Here’s Martha McHardy’s report. The National Enquirer was the go-to American tabloid for many years. Donald Trump helped change that 13:45 , Joe Sommerlad Catch-and-kill. Checkbook journalism. Secret deals. Friends helping friends. Even by National Enquirer standards, testimony by its former publisher David Pecker at Trump‘s hush money trial this week has revealed an astonishing level of corruption at America’s best-known tabloid and may one day be seen as the moment it effectively died. “It just has zero credibility,” said Lachlan Cartwright, executive editor of The Enquirer from 2014 to 2017. “Whatever sort of credibility it had was totally damaged by what happened in court this week.” Don Jr and Eric ‘helping to pick next Trump officials and staffers' 13:30 , Joe Sommerlad Trump’s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, are reportedly playing a central role in drawing up a list of potential candidates to join a second Trump administration in anticipation of their father’s victory over Joe Biden in November’s presidential election. The brothers are not running the transition team, leaving that responsibility to the Trump campaign’s senior adviser, Susie Wiles, but are instead playing a lead role in vetting prospective officials and staffers on ideological grounds. By doing so, they reportedly hope to ensure a greater degree of loyalty than the former president experienced during his chaotic first term in the White House from 2017 to 2021. Don Jr in particular has made it his mission “to keep the John Boltons of the world outside a second Trump administration”, one insider told Axios, referring to the Republican’s estranged former national security adviser, a foreign policy hawk who has become a potent critic since being dismissed in September 2019. Team Biden hits back after Trump dismisses Charlottesville as ‘little peanut’ 13:15 , Joe Sommerlad The Republican presidential candidate/criminal defendant may come to regret bringing up the notorious “Unite the Right” rally in his recent denunciation of pro-Palestinian demonstrations on American college campuses.

New York hush money trial: What did Trump say after he left court yesterday? 12:30 , Joe Sommerlad Well, I guess you asked for it, so here’s a complete transcript of His Majesty’s (somewhat deranged) remarks from yesterday afternoon: “Today was breathtaking… breathtaking and amazing testimony. So this is a trial that should’ve never happened, this is a case that should’ve never been filed and was really an incredible, an incredible day. Open your eyes and we can’t let this continue to happen to our country. “On another matter, you know, the economy has just been reported to be doing very badly the stock market’s way down. And some horrible numbers came out, including very high numbers on inflation and in particular gasoline at seven and a half dollars in California and that usually leads the way. It’s going to happen here too. “And very importantly as you look at the various colleges all over the country and beyond colleges because it’s happening in other areas too. You see what’s happening on the front having to do with Palestine and Israel and protests and hate, anger Biden is sending an absolutely horrible message. Horrible, horrible message. He has no idea how to message. He can’t speak. He can’t put two sentences together. He doesn’t know what to do. This is not a president. This is somebody that shouldn’t be doing what he’s doing. Because he can’t do it again. He can’t do it well. “We’re having protests all over. He was talking about Charlottesville. Charlottesville was a little peanut. And it was nothing compared, the hate wasn’t the kind of hate that you have here. This is tremendous hate and we have a man that can’t talk about it because he doesn’t understand and he doesn’t understand what’s going on with our country. He doesn’t understand that all over the world we’re being laughed at as a country because of him and his administration. “And today we had, I hear, because I was forced to be here and I’m glad I was because it was a very interesting day in a certain way. But the US Supreme Court had a monumental hearing on immunity and the immunity having to do with presidential immunity. I think it was made clear, I hope it was made clear, that the president has to have immunity or you don’t have a president or at most you could say it would be a ceremonial president. That’s not what the founders had in mind. We’re not talking about ceremony. We want presidents that can get things done and bring people together. So, I heard it, the meeting was quite amazing coordination as the justices were on their game. So let’s see how that all pans out. But again, I say presidential immunity: very powerful, presidential immunity is imperative, or you practically won’t have a country anymore. Thank you very much.” Trump loses latest bid for new E Jean Carroll defamation trial 12:15 , Joe Sommerlad The former president’s request to have a new trial in his $83m defamation case with writer E Jean Carroll, who accused him of sexual assault, was denied by a federal court on Thursday. Judge Lews Kaplan of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected the motion. Here’s Eric Garcia’s report. New York hush money trial: What to expect on day eight 12:00 , Joe Sommerlad Our man Alex Woodward is back at the Manhattan Criminal Court once more this morning and says this: “We are going to have more cross-examination of David Pecker from Trump defence attorney Emil Bove today. “He didn’t give the judge a timeline for how long he’s going to take, but he’s speeding through questions to cast an overall pall of untrustworthiness in an attempt to impeach Pecker’s credibility on the stand. “We still haven’t heard from Justice Merchan about the 10 alleged gag order violations, so that could come up. “He also scheduled a hearing on four more alleged violations for next week.” You can see the prosecution’s filings on that here and here. Trump tells Newsmax he never actually wanted to ‘lock up’ Hillary Clinton and backs away from testifying 11:45 , Joe Sommerlad In another media phone-in last night, the defendant rowed back on one of his most notorious catchphrases and insisted again that he is on trial for no reason whatsoever. There was also plenty of electioneering hyperbole like this, which is simply untrue. “The best economy in history”?? Is that how you remember it America? Perhaps more significantly, he’s now saying he will only take the stand in Manhattan to defend himself “if it’s necessary”, a big retreat from his earlier posturing on the matter, presumably after being strongly advised against it by Todd Blanche and Emile Bove. Key takeaways from hush money trial day seven: Arnie, Melania and ‘mentor’ Trump 11:30 , Joe Sommerlad Here’s Kelly Rissman with a comprehensive round-up of Thursday’s events from Manhattan. New York hush money trial: Trump ‘used White House to manage blowback from affair allegations’ 11:15 , Joe Sommerlad According to Pecker’s testimony yesterday, Trump’s interest in the Karen McDougal story did not end with its initial suppression and his victory in the 2016 election. Instead, he continued to keep tabs on McDougal’s contractual agreement with American Media Inc to keep quiet through at least his first year in office, with Pecker recounting several incidents in which Trump asked after “our girl” and another in which he raged at the publisher after the story finally became public and the model was interviewed by CNN’s Anderson Cooper in March 2018. Here’s more from Alex Woodward. New York hush money trial: Arnold Schwarzenegger dragged into Trump web of intrigue 10:45 , Joe Sommerlad Pecker, who will be back on the stand for probably the final time today for more cross-examination from Trump attorney Emile Bove, also revealed on Thursday that he previously had a similar “catch-and-kill” arrangement with Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger during his run to be governor of California. His name came up, along with those of other celebrities like Mark Wahlberg and Tiger Woods, when Pecker was asked about how commonplace his “checkbook journalism” antics were. Here’s Alex Woodward on that too. New York hush money trial: David Pecker testifies to Trump plan to bury Karen McDougal story 10:15 , Joe Sommerlad Back in Manhattan, the former National Enquirer was back on the stand for his third day of testimony about his magazine’s “catch-and-kill” game. Pecker testified that he agreed to spend tens of thousands of dollars to buy and then bury politically compromising stories about Trump with the assurance that “the boss will take care of it”. That promise, allegedly from Trump’s then-personal attorney Michael Cohen, gave the ex-American Media Inc chief the green light to pay Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 to buy the rights to her story of an alleged affair with the then-presidential candidate. Alex Woodward was there and sent this report. Key Takeaways from Trump’s immunity arguments at the Supreme Court 09:45 , Joe Sommerlad On the final day of arguments for this term, the nine justices questioned lawyers for Trump and Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith for three hours, toying with whether or not American presidents should be awarded broad, some or no immunity from criminal prosecution. Here are Ariana Baio’s takeaways from the hearing. Supreme Court justices appear poised to offer Trump some immunity 09:15 , Joe Sommerlad Trump is right that it was a “BIG DAY IN COURT(S)” yesterday, with the Supreme Court hearing oral arguments on his dubious “presidential immunity” defence and his hush money trial picking up in New York. In DC, the justices appeared poised to offer Trump and future US presidents some form of protection from criminal prosecution over actions carried out while in the White House while rejecting broad absolute immunity, acknowleding the “huge implications” of their eventual decision. Ariana Baio has this report on a monumental day, which could have major repercussions for this year’s presidential race, let alone the future of American democracy. Truth Social: Trump claims hush money trial ‘has completely fallen apart’ and bashes media rivals 08:49 , Joe Sommerlad Good morning! Let’s take a look at Trump’s latest social media output, shall we? Still absolutely refusing to learn his lesson regarding the gag order in the hush money trial, he has again referred to Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg as “Soros backed” and claimed, preposterously, that the case “has completely fallen apart” and that “Virtually every Legal Scholar and Expert has stated that there is no Crime, there never was.” Have they? You’d think we would have heard about that by now. Meanwhile, he’s continued to push his lie that the New York City authorities are suppressing (non-existent) mass MAGA protests outside the courthouse and posted further Fox News clips attacking the “sham” trial. Elsewhere, he’s back to trashing Morning Joe and The New York Times again like 2017 never ended but is curiously quiet on the subject of the Supreme Court, indicating, perhaps, that he realises just how pivotal the justices’ eventual ruling will be to his fate. Reversing Trump repeal, FCC restores net neutrality 08:15 , AP The FCC on Thursday restored “net neutrality” rules that prevent broadband internet providers such as Comcast and AT&T from favoring some sites and apps over others. The move effectively reinstates a net neutrality order the commission first issued in 2015 during the Obama administration; under then-President Donald Trump, the FCC subsequently repealed those rules in 2017. Net neutrality is the principle that providers of internet service should treat all traffic equally. The rules, for instance, ban practices that throttle or block certain sites or apps, or that offer higher speeds to customers willing to pay extra. Read more... Trump claims campus protests are worse than deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville 06:15 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump has claimed that the antisemitic, white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 was “peanuts” compared to the current pro-Palestine demonstrations across US college campuses. Mr Trump made the comments on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Wednesday. “Joe Biden would say, constantly, that he ran because of Charlottesville,” he wrote, referencing the 2020 election. “Well, if that’s the case, he’s done a really terrible job because Charlottesville is like a ‘peanut’ compared to the riots and anti-Israel protests that are happening all over our Country, RIGHT NOW.” Graig Graziosi has the story: Trump vows to beat Biden in New York 04:15 , Oliver O'Connell Donald Trump vowed to beat President Joe Biden in the 2024 election in New York as he made a surprise campaign stop at a construction site in Manhattan early on Thursday morning – on a day when testimony resumes in his hush money trial and the US Supreme Court hears arguments in his “presidential immunity” case. “We’re going to make a play for New York,” Mr Trump told reporters at the event. Martha McHardy has the story: 03:15 , Oliver O'Connell The National Enquirer was the go-to American tabloid for many years. Donald Trump helped change that 01:15 , AP Catch and kill. Checkbook journalism. Secret deals. Friends helping friends. Even by National Enquirer standards, testimony by its former publisher David Pecker at Donald Trump‘s hush money trial this week has revealed an astonishing level of corruption at America’s best-known tabloid and may one day be seen as the moment it effectively died. “It just has zero credibility,” said Lachlan Cartwright, executive editor of the Enquirer from 2014 to 2017. “Whatever sort of credibility it had was totally damaged by what happened in court this week.” On Thursday, Pecker was back on the witness stand to tell more about the arrangement he made to boost Trump’s presidential candidacy in 2016, tear down his rivals and silence any revelations that may have damaged him.

The US District Court for the Southern District of New York handed down the denial on Thursday after Mr Trump had sought a new trial. In May 2023, a jury found Mr Trump liable for sexually abusing Ms Carroll. Then, earlier this year, a jury determined that Mr Trump for defaming Ms Carroll, with $65mn in punitive damages and $18mn in compensatory damages. In response, Mr Trump posted a $91.6mn bond to appeal the verdict against him. Read on...

Watch: Trump glad to have been forced to attend ‘very interesting day’ despite missing SCOTUS immunity hearing Thursday 25 April 2024 22:00 , Oliver O'Connell What is happening with the gag order violations? Thursday 25 April 2024 21:52 , Alex Woodward Judge Juan Merchan has not yet issued an order on the 10 alleged gag order violations, but he will hold a hearing on the 11th through 14th alleged incidents next week, as he did the other day about those first 10. We are still waiting on an order regarding the first 10. It is unclear if he'll do something about that before the next hearing or whether he will wait to do it all together. That seems doubtful. MAGA conspiracy blog files for bankruptcy amid string of defamation lawsuits Thursday 25 April 2024 21:45 , Oliver O'Connell Popular MAGA conspiracy blog Gateway Pundit is filing for bankruptcy amid a string of defamation lawsuits it is facing. The blog, which was launched in 2004, has been a hotbed of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, school shootings, and other topics since its founding and has staunchly promoted Donald Trump and his MAGA allies, with the site being granted White House press credentials during the Trump administration. But its peddling of conspiracy theories has landed the blog in hot water in recent years and it is now facing several lawsuits alleging it promoted bogus claims about the 2020 election. Martha McHardy reports: Watch: Hoarse-sounding Trump says testimony was ‘breathtaking’ Thursday 25 April 2024 21:42 , Oliver O'Connell Judge sets cause hearing for alleged gag order violations Thursday 25 April 2024 21:36 , Oliver O'Connell Thursday 25 April 2024 21:31 , Alex Woodward Steinglass is elaborating now without a jury present about his objection during the cross-examination of Pecker. “That was a totally improper line of questioning” and an “improper impeachment violation” of the witness, Steinglass says. Steinglass is arguing that the documents Bove has been referencing would not help Pecker remember what he's saying, leaving a false impression to jurors that Pecker could have remembered what he was saying if he looked at them. “There wasn't anything in that document and therefore it's misleading,” Judge Merchan said. Bove tries to jump in. Merchan cuts him off. “Are you missing my point?” he said. “Please be careful.” Court is done for the day. Thursday 25 April 2024 21:23 , Alex Woodward Bove questions Pecker's earlier testimony about Hope Hicks jumping in and out of the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting. That elicits an objection from prosecution attorney Joshua Steinglass. Judge Merchan sustains the objection. Bove is suggesting that Pecker didn't mention Hope Hicks at any point in his July 2018 meeting with prosecutors. ""I don't remember,"" Pecker says. Steinglass wants to approach the bench again. It's the third time they've done so over this particular line of questioning. Trump looks casual, and unworried, chatting with defence attorney Susan Necheles while the attorneys are at the bench. He's gestured towards them a couple of times. And with that, Merchan is excusing jurors for the day. Pecker is still on the stand, alone, looking like he's just seen a ghost. Cross-examination will resume and likely finish tomorrow. Pecker testimony gives insight into Trump’s preoccupation with McDougal affair Thursday 25 April 2024 21:08 , Oliver O'Connell Thursday 25 April 2024 21:06 , Alex Woodward Bove: “Because in fairness it's hard to remember the dates of these things even when they happened a couple of months ago, right?” Trump is the most alert he's been all day. Chin up, staring at Pecker, jerking his head. Bove keeps trying to suggest prosecutors prepped him for testimony and has been instructed to say what he's saying today. ""What I said under oath was the truth,"" Pecker says. ""That’s all I planned on doing today."" ""It's not a script."" Thursday 25 April 2024 21:01 , Alex Woodward Bove's line of questioning about Pecker not giving an exact date for the Trump Tower meeting in August 2015 suggests that he is trying to cast to the jury that his testimony is unreliable. He notes that Trump wasn't even in New York City in the first week of August because he was preparing for a debate. “You changed your testimony this week on this issue,” Bove says. Steinglass keeps trying to object. “Why did you change your testimony?” Bove says. Pecker wasn't sure what the date was, just that it was in the middle of August. “I don't mean to put you on the spot,” Bove says. “Even when you're doing your best ... it's hard to remember what people said almost 10 years ago, correct? ... You fill in some details to keep them in sequence, and to make them sound logical?” Pecker can only say yes. Bove will certainly be using this against him to make the rest of his testimony look wholly unreliable. Thursday 25 April 2024 20:58 , Alex Woodward Trump is slouching with his right arm slung over his chair. Bove gets Pecker to admit that he bought a story about Tiger Woods in order to use it for leverage to get him to appear in AMI titles. Trump has put his arm back down. Now he's crossing his arms and squinting and jerking his head to get a look at Pecker on the witness stand. We're hearing about Pecker's deals to suppress other stories about Rahm Emanuel and Mark Wahlberg. Thursday 25 April 2024 20:50 , Alex Woodward Bove is asking many yes or no questions. Pecker hasn't said much other than “yes”. Pecker agrees with Bove that he had never heard of a “catch-and-kill” scheme until after this case. Bove's questions all typically end with a “right?” or something to that effect, prompting Pecker to say some version of “yes”. It gives Bove a lot of control of the narrative to the jury. For example, here's Bove coming back to the Arnold Schwarzenneger scenario from 2002: In that period, you were trying to expand AMI's holding in the fitness business? Yes. A huge deal, right? worth about $365m? You wanted this to go through very much? Yes to all. You needed Arnold's blessing, correct? Yes. You met him in person and you reached an agreement? Yes, we did.

An auditor previously warned the bank of “material weaknesses” of internal controls. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Key Facts Republic First reported a decline in deposits in a presentation to investors last year, which also indicated the value of the company’s mortgage loan portfolio had “declined substantially in a rising rate environment.” The company said at the time it would “wind down and exit” the mortgage business and instead focus on consumer deposits, of which about 60% were uninsured as of last June, The Wall Street Journal reported. The Norcross-Braca Group said in September it would invest $35 million into Republic First if the bank filed its 2022 report and scheduled a required shareholder meeting. The investment group backed out of the deal in February after Republic First failed to hold its shareholder meeting, which was reportedly postponed in November to “better align with the timing of the transaction close.” Despite the failed deal, Republic First said in a regulatory filing the bank’s strategic plan was designed to work without the Norcross-Braca infusion, noting the bank had an “adequately capitalized position” that has a “strong deposit base and ample liquidity.” Key Background The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities seized Republic First on Friday, following speculation the bank would be seized by regulators as it looked for a potential buyer. Fulton Bank reached an agreement to take over Republic First’s 32 branches across Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, which will reopen under the Fulton Bank name. Before the seizure, Republic First was delisted by Nasdaq in August, after the bank failed to file its fiscal year 2022 report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Republic First claimed the report was not filed because of its “former executive team’s failure to maintain adequate internal controls.” Surprising Fact In 2022, Republic First’s financial auditor told the bank it had “material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting,” according to a regulatory filing. That auditor was dismissed by Republic First in February. Surprising Fact Republic First’s seizure is the fourth by federal or state regulators since the start of 2023, following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank, which were substantially larger than Republic First. Republic First had about $6 billion in assets and an additional $4 billion in deposits in January, according to the FDIC, whereas Signature Bank had $110 billion in assets and $88 billion in deposits. First Republic had $232.9 billion in assets and $104.5 billion in deposits when it was seized, while Silicon Valley had assets totaling $209 billion. Tangent Feddie Strickland, an analyst at the financial consulting firm Janney Montgomery Scott, told The New York Times that the banking sector would likely remain stable despite Republic First’s collapse. Bank failures last year—which happened in rapid succession—were “really banks with a certain specialization,” Strickland said, adding he believes “small banks are in good shape.” Silicon Valley Bank was a lender to tech startups, while Signature Bank was a leader in cryptocurrency lending and First Republic had a largely high-net-worth clientele.

Republic First Bank, which had conducted business as Republic Bank and had $6 billion in assets, is the first U.S. bank to fail this year, underscoring how some regional lenders continue to struggle a year after three regional banks failed. The Pennsylvania state regulator closed Republic Bank on Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver, which sold the bank to Fulton for an undisclosed price. Fulton acquired $4 billion of the bank's deposits and $2.9 billion in loans. The combined company now expects to have $32.8 billion in total assets and Fulton expects the deal will double its presence in the Philadelphia market. ""We anticipate improving the risk profile of the company with improved liquidity, internal capital generation, profitability and earnings,"" Fulton's CEO Curtis Myers said in an investor conference on Monday. Fulton's management said it expects to receive roughly $1 billion from the FDIC as part of the transaction terms. Its stock was last up 8% in afternoon trading Republic Bank, which had been targeted by multiple activist investors since 2021, had struggled amid elevated interest rates, which had depressed the value of securities on its balance sheet and hurt its commercial real estate portfolio that accounts for about 45% of its loan book. Its shares were delisted from the Nasdaq in August and had since been trading over the counter. The bank cut jobs in May 2023 to reduce costs and exited its mortgage origination business, and in September announced it was entering into a $35 million capital infusion deal with an activist investor group led by veteran businessman George Norcross. But that deal fell through in February. Regulators had reportedly been discussing a sale of the bank before the deal was signed. INDUSTRY STRESS Investors have been worried about the health of regional lenders since Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic and Signature Bank collapsed in early 2023 following depositor runs, although the market took Friday's news in its stride. The KBW regional banking index was last down marginally in early afternoon trading. ""There is always the danger that some bank somewhere unwittingly – or wittingly – takes too much of what turns out to be the wrong risk at the wrong time, while the rise of internet banking does make it so much easier for deposits, and any bad news, to move so much more quickly,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""The key to maintaining confidence is to keep depositors whole."" Fulton also launched an offering of its common stock and said it intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including supporting ""new opportunities"" from the acquisition. It intends to sell roughly 16.7 million shares priced at $15 apiece to raise about $250 million. Myers said the deal was not contingent on the bank raising capital. ""Capital raise was not required, the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) approved our bid based on bank level capital as is, not even the holding company,"" he added. Fulton disclosed office loans - a sector in stress as buildings run empty post-pandemic - accounted for roughly $200 million of Republic Bank's total loan book. The FDIC took some losses on Republic Bank's securities, which were then transferred to Fulton at fair value, executives said. Analysts at Jefferies said they expect the integration to be smooth and boost the bank's liquidity, even though this is the largest deal Fulton has undertaken post the global financial crisis. Through previous close, it had a market capitalization of $2.53 billion. The FDIC estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund related to the failure of Republic Bank would be $667 million.

Fulton is also assuming all deposits.Republic First Bank is a regional lender operating in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. The company did business as Republic Bank and had roughly $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits as of Jan. 31.Republic Bank's 32 branches will reopen as branches of Fulton Bank as early as Saturday. Republic First Bank depositors can access their funds via checks or ATMs as early as Friday night, the FDIC said.If you have a Republic Bank ATM or debit card, or a check, you can still use them. If you have a loan with Republic, you should still make payments as normal.""Depositors of Republic Bank will become depositors of Fulton Bank so customers do not need to change their banking relationship in order to retain their deposit insurance coverage,"" the FDIC said. ""Customers of Republic Bank should continue to use their existing branches until they receive notice from Fulton Bank that it has completed systems changes that will allow its branch offices to process their accounts as well.""The bank's failure is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund $667 million, but the FDIC said Fulton Bank acquiring Republic First Bank was the cheapest resolution.Anyone with less than $250,000 in any bank account insured by the FDIC is protected even if that person's bank fails. Why did Republic First Bank fail?The lender is the first FDIC-insured institution to fail in the U.S. in 2024. The last bank failure — Citizens Bank, based in Sac City, Iowa — was in November 2023.In a strong economy, an average of only four or five banks close each year. Rising interest rates and falling commercial real estate values, especially for office buildings grappling with surging vacancy rates following the pandemic, have heightened the financial risks for many regional and community banks. Outstanding loans backed by properties that have lost value make them a challenge to refinance.Last month, an investor group including Steven Mnuchin, who served as U.S. Treasury secretary during the Trump administration, agreed to pump more than $1 billion to rescue New York Community Bancorp, which has been hammered by weakness in commercial real estate and growing pains resulting from its buyout of a distressed bank.How to contact the FDIC and Fulton BankThe FDIC says customers with questions about the acquisition can contact the FDIC at 1-877-467-0178.

What You Need To Know About the First US Bank Failure of 2024 - Investopedia,What You Need To Know About the First US Bank Failure of 2024  Investopedia,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 20:57:16 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vZmlyc3QtYmFuay1mYWlsdXJlLTIwMjQtZnVsdG9uLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1idXlzLXJlcHVibGljLWZpcnN0LTg2NDA0NTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Investopedia,"Fulton Financial (FULT) shares surged Monday after the bank said it acquired the debt and deposits of Philadelphia-based Republic First Bank following the first bank failure of 2024. Republic First Bank was seized by regulators Friday after a deal for $35 million in funding reportedly fell apart earlier this year. After a deal was reached with Fulton, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said the Fulton deal was the least costly path for the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). It estimated the failure will cost the DIF about $667 million. Why Republic First Bank Collapsed Republic Bank had struggled amid an elevated interest rate environment, reporting last year that rising rates in the face of the Fed's rate hikes to curb inflation hurt its commercial real estate portfolio. Commercial real estate, a sector that has been under stress in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, accounted for nearly half of Republic Bank's loan book. The bank also faced challenges with low liquidity and battles with activist investors. Republic Bank managed to secure $35 million in funding from a group of investors led by George Norcross late last year, but that plan fell apart in February. First Bank Failure of 2024 Near Anniversary of SVB, Signature, and First Republic Failures The seizure and subsequent sale of Republic Bank comes a little more than a year after a series of bank failures that rocked the industry in 2023, as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank shut down in March 2023. The collapse of First Republic Bank followed in May. The crisis put a squeeze on smaller regional banks to compete for deposits as many consumers fled to the security of larger banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which acquired First Republic last year and was one of several large banks that stepped in to provide financial assistance. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter earlier this month that the worst of the banking crisis seemed to have passed, but warned persistently high interest rates could cause trouble for regional banks across the country. What Happens Next Fulton agreed to acquire all $6 billion of Republic's assets, along with the bank's $5.3 billion in liabilities in the form of $4 billion in deposits and ""other borrowings and liabilities"" of $1.3 billion. Fulton and the FDIC said on Friday that Republic's 32 branches would reopen as Fulton branches, effectively doubling Fulton's retail banking footprint in the Philadelphia area. Fulton Announces $250 Million Stock Offering Fulton also announced plans Monday to offer 16.67 million shares of its common stock priced at $15 per share in order to raise $250 million. The lender said it plans to use the funds for ""general corporate purposes,"" including costs associated with the Republic acquisition. Fulton shares finished 7.6% higher at $16.80 Monday following the acquisition and stock offering news.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/R23P9dXRj2VZ7WB4d98lxgb9Jko=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1250648923-0669d0772c784b6eb3562b70acafe789.jpg,2024-04-29,-0.281,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fulton', 'latitude': 44.9119987487793, 'longitude': -93.32119750976562, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 41.12166976928711, 'longitude': -83.01750183105469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 42.75035858154297, 'longitude': -71.83702087402344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DIF', 'latitude': 0.9915599822998047, 'longitude': 40.9551887512207, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.
CRE Markets Face Limited Impact from Republic First Bank Failure - Commercial Observer,CRE Markets Face Limited Impact from Republic First Bank Failure  Commercial Observer,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 21:02:54 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vY29tbWVyY2lhbG9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA0L2NyZS1tYXJrZXRzLWxpbWl0ZWQtaW1wYWN0LXJlcHVibGljLWZpcnN0LWJhbmstZmFpbHVyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Commercial Observer,"The first bank collapse of 2024 is small enough in size to likely avoid bringing on additional pains to an already wounded commercial real estate industry, but underscores sensitivities market participants are facing around future problems down the horizon. Philadelphia-based Republic First Bank, which had $5.87 billion of total assets at the close of 2023, was shuttered by Pennsylvania regulators Friday just over a year after a regional banking crisis unfolded following the shutdowns of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. “This is a relatively small bank failure with limited implications for the real estate portfolio in the markets where Republic First is active, but what’s telling is that a bank failure of this size would garner as much attention as it has,” said Sam Chandan, director of New York University’s Chen Institute for Global Real Estate Finance. “The market is particularly sensitive to signals of instability in the banking system and that’s reflected in the attention that this relatively small bank failure has received because the market is working to discern whether or not the failure has a bearing on or is relevant to our thinking about broader bank stability.” Fulton Financial Corp., another Pennsylvania regional bank headquartered in Lancaster, Penn. acquired Republic First’s assets and deposits via an auction overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Curt Myers, chairman and CEO of Fulton, said the transaction would double its presence in the Philadelphia region. The collapse of Republic Bank marks the sixth largest failed bank since 2010, but far smaller than the collapses of SVB and First Republic, which both had more than $200 billion in assets and Signature, who had over $100 billion, according to an analysis by S&P Global Ratings. S&P noted that similar to last year’s bank failures, Republic First was undone by unrealized loan losses compounded by elevated interest rates. Republic First struggled for a number of months leading up to Friday’’s shuttering with around half of its deposits uninsured at the end of last year 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday citing FDIC data. State regulators had prepared to take over Republic First in late 2023 before a deal was struck with investors to shore up the balance sheet that eventually collapsed in March, according to the WSJ story. As of Dec 31, 2021, Republic First’s CRE loans totaled $780.3 million, or 31 percent of its loan portfolio, according to the company’s latest 10-K filing from late 2022. While Republic First’s collapse will have a muted impact on the CRE sector, Chandan noted that it does underscore the reality of deposit flights that exist at smaller banks, which will likely lead to increased consolidation that may limit lender options in some markets. “The markets that I think are most impacted by this consolidation that might result from deposit flight are really smaller secondary and tertiary markets where there are invariably only a small number of lenders that are active in the marketplace,” Chandan said. “This will be sort of a national phenomenon where smaller tertiary markets in particular where your small regional banks and community banks play an outsized role in supporting the commercial real estate sector are the ones that are most at risk of seeing retrenchments in financing during a period of bank consolidation.” Andrew Coen can be reached at acoen@commercialobserver.com",https://commercialobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Republic-Bank-GettyImages-1865003179-WEB.jpg?quality=80,2024-04-29,-0.139,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.962581634521484, 'longitude': -79.876708984375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania', 'latitude': 40.2724494934082, 'longitude': -76.90567016601562, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York University', 'latitude': 40.72871017456055, 'longitude': -73.9959716796875, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fulton', 'latitude': 44.9119987487793, 'longitude': -93.32119750976562, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Lancaster', 'latitude': 40.037879943847656, 'longitude': -76.30551147460938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Penn', 'latitude': 40.32896041870117, 'longitude': -79.64115142822266, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Street', 'latitude': 51.12472152709961, 'longitude': -2.740000009536743, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CRE', 'latitude': 47.6781005859375, 'longitude': -0.15639999508857727, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chandan', 'latitude': 28.190229415893555, 'longitude': 68.73664855957031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

It also comes after last year’s failures of First Republic Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. According to bank regulators, Republic’s 32 branches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York are now operating under the Fulton Bank brand, with depositors transitioning from the failed bank to the acquirer. “Customers of Republic Bank should continue to use their existing branches until they receive notice from Fulton Bank that it has completed system changes that will allow its branch offices to process their accounts as well,” the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), the appointed receiver, explained in a statement. The FDIC estimates that the cost related to the failure will be $667 million. Fulton is purchasing $6 billion in assets from Republic, including its $2 billion investment portfolio and $2.9 billion in loans. Republic had an active business that specialized in jumbo mortgage products. In a presentation last year, the bank said it “had aggressive rates, higher risk, and lower risk-adjusted rates of return than other asset classes.” In July 2023, the bank said that to enhance efficiency and streamline operations, it reduced its presence in New York and exited the mortgage banking business. Ultimately, it originated about $50 million in mortgages in 2023, per mortgage tech platform Modex. Meanwhile, Modex shows that Fulton’s mortgage production was about $1.2 billion in 2023, with most of it being conventional (74%) and purchase (65%) loans. The bank had 766 loan officers as of Monday, according to the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS). Republic Bank is adding $5.3 billion in liabilities to Fulton, which includes $4 billion in deposits. The volume almost doubles the acquirer’s presence in the Philadelphia market, with combined deposits of nearly $8.6 billion. Fulton claims that the transaction also reduces its loan-to-deposit ratio from 99% to 92%, improving its liquidity. “With this transaction, we are excited to double our presence across the region,” Curt Myers, Fulton chairman and CEO, said in a statement. All regulatory approvals have been obtained, including from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.",https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/100dollarbill_unsplash.jpeg,2024-04-29,-0.002,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Fulton Bank', 'description': 'regional financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'Fulton Bank'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania', 'latitude': 40.2724494934082, 'longitude': -76.90567016601562, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Lancaster', 'latitude': 40.037879943847656, 'longitude': -76.30551147460938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.962581634521484, 'longitude': -79.876708984375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Jersey', 'latitude': 40.16706085205078, 'longitude': -74.49987030029297, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fulton', 'latitude': 43.32284927368164, 'longitude': -76.41716003417969, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

As testimony ended last week, Gary Farro, a senior managing director at the now-defunct First Republic Bank in New York, was describing how he set up an account in October 2016 for Michael Cohen, Trump’s one-time lawyer and political fixer. Cohen has said he used the account to make the hush money payment to the film star, Stormy Daniels, two weeks ahead of the 2016 election to keep the information from voters before they headed to the polls. Farro said Cohen funded the new account by taking money from his home equity line of credit, which Cohen has said he did so his wife would not know about the transaction. Cohen, who was convicted of campaign finance charges in connection with the payment to Daniels, has turned against his former boss and is expected to be a key witness against him. The hush money payment is at the heart of the charges Trump is facing in the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Prosecutors have charged Trump with falsifying 34 business records at his Trump Organization real estate conglomerate to hide reimbursement of the funds that Cohen paid to Daniels to keep her quiet. Trump says the payments were for Cohen’s legal work. Trump has denied Daniels’ claim that they had sex at a celebrity golf tournament a decade before the election. Trump, now the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, also faces three other indictments encompassing an additional 54 charges, including two cases accusing him of illegally trying to upend his loss to Joe Biden four years ago. He has denied all the charges. Because of his lawyers’ legal challenges in the other three cases, the New York trial may be the only one he faces before the 2024 election. Testimony in the trial started last week. David Pecker, a former publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid and a long-time Trump friend, told the 12-member jury during four days of testimony that he agreed at an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower in New York with Trump and Cohen to do whatever he could to help Trump win the presidency. Prosecutors are calling the meeting the “Trump Tower conspiracy.” Pecker said he published favorable stories about Trump and embellished negative ones about his opponents. More importantly, Pecker said he paid $150,000 to a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to kill information of her claim that she had a monthslong affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. Trump has denied the affair, but Pecker testified that Trump at one point called McDougal “a nice girl.” After he became president, Pecker said Trump asked about her well-being as he and Pecker walked the White House grounds in mid-2017. In addition, Pecker said he paid another $30,000 to a doorman at a Trump New York property to kill his false claim that Trump had fathered an out-of-wedlock child. Prosecutors have not publicly disclosed who their next witness will be after Farro. The trial could last another five weeks before the jury considers the case. Testimony is set for four days a week, excluding Wednesdays, but also was called off on Monday this week.

The closure of Republic First marks the first failure of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured bank of 2024 and comes after efforts to find a buyer for the bank fell through earlier in the year. According to the FDIC, the bank had about $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits as of Jan. 31. It is a significantly smaller bank than those that failed last year. Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank all had balance sheets totaling hundreds of billions. Federal regulators were also able to find a buyer in Fulton Financial, which means the FDIC won’t have to backstop deposits over the $250,000 limit like it did for two of 2023’s bank failures. Republic First’s failure is expected to cost the FDIC fund $667 million, the agency said. The closure of Republic First comes after a string of bank failures last spring that sparked congressional and regulatory scrutiny amid concerns about faith in the banking system being shaken and investigations finding rampant mismanagement of risk at banks holding tens of billions in deposits and assets. Industry analysts aren’t anticipating more widespread trouble despite the closure of Republic First, but there are still several risks hanging over regional-sized banks. Only a handful of banks in the U.S. typically close under a strong economy. A Fed review of the collapse of SVB found a combination of very poor risk management, weaker regulations and lax government supervision all contributed to its collapse and sparked the run on Signature and First Republic. Republic First suffered from some of the same ailments as the regional banks that collapsed last year, including losses on bonds that lost value with higher interest rates and elevated rates of uninsured deposits that can quickly be removed and sent to money center banks like JPMorgan Chase. The biggest risk from the 2023 failures was the risk of contagion, which would lead to a run on deposits like what happened to SVB and spark a broader crisis in the banking sector that would result in a larger run of failures. Those concerns did not come to pass but regulators and lawmakers in Congress have also ramped up scrutiny of how banks are operating and what kind of risk management they are performing. “Banks, by and large, are in reasonably better shape than they than they were a year ago,” said Cliff Rossi, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business who also worked in high levels of risk management for several large banks. “I don't expect another March 2023 imminent at any point.” The Federal Reserve, which oversees banks, is also considering numerous proposals to create a stricter regulatory environment including higher cash reserves to cover losses. The most pressing risk for banks is a high interest rate environment that doesn’t appear to be easing anytime soon as the Federal Reserve tries to bring inflation under control. Economists and investors have scaled back expectations about potential rate cuts this year as inflation has remained sticky and the economy continues to be relatively healthy overall. Commercial real estate, especially office buildings, have also created higher risks for regional and community banks that are seeing lower property values and higher interest rates. “There's a higher probability that we will see more bank failures simply because banks are not used to being in this kind of an interest rate environment,” Rossi said. “Most of the management teams and boards that are out there have not lived through this, so they were caught off guard and all of their interest rate risk practices, and I think the same was true, quite honestly about the regulators, too.”",https://thenationaldesk.com/resources/media/c8992059-c1a0-4b12-ae12-439b581d6f26-large16x9_23073674379757.jpg?1679241789726,2024-04-29,-0.308,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Robert H.

Yeah... I think I'll stick to #Bitcoin.— Marto👨🏻‍💻 (@martocsan_) April 26, 2024It's important to note that Republic First and First Republic are not the same institutions. Republic First was a regional bank that catered to commercial and retail customers. Conversely, First Republic specialized in private banking services for wealthy clients.However, First Republic also declared bankruptcy last year, and its assets were sold by the FDIC. A buyer was quickly found, and in May 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired the bank. That same month, executives from First Republic faced an SEC insider trading probe, and the new owner decided to lay off over 1,000 employees from the recently acquired, bankrupt bank.FDIC-Assisted AcquisitionTo protect depositors and ensure a smooth transition, the FDIC agreed with Fulton Bank to assume substantially all of Republic First Bank's deposits and purchase most of its assets. As of January 2024, Republic First Bank had approximately $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in total deposits. The FDIC estimates that the cost of the failure to its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) will be $667 million.Fulton Bank's acquisition of Republic First Bank is expected to nearly double its presence in the Philadelphia market, with combined company deposits of approximately $8.6 billion. To ensure a seamless transition for Republic First Bank's customers, all 32 branches in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York will reopen as branches of Fulton Bank on Monday during normal business hours. Customers of Republic First Bank will automatically become depositors of Fulton Bank, maintaining their existing deposit insurance coverage without the need to change their banking relationship.",https://images.financemagnates.com/images/Bankrupt%20880x400_id_20bdf478-a267-462a-98ac-17c92c255c96_size900.jpg,2024-04-29,-0.109,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Fulton Bank', 'description': 'regional financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'Fulton Bank'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Marto', 'description': 'Spanish company specializing in manufacture of antique weapons', 'full_name': 'Marto'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.962581634521484, 'longitude': -79.876708984375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Fulton', 'latitude': 44.9119987487793, 'longitude': -93.32119750976562, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania Department of Banking', 'latitude': 40.26028060913086, 'longitude': -76.88263702392578, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corp', 'latitude': 45.17805099487305, 'longitude': 5.864319801330566, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reuters', 'latitude': 50.67449951171875, 'longitude': 9.351499557495117, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Don', 'latitude': 53.52177810668945, 'longitude': -1.139870047569275, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SEC', 'latitude': 45.75471878051758, 'longitude': 14.853890419006348, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'DIF', 'latitude': 0.9915599822998047, 'longitude': 40.9551887512207, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Jersey', 'latitude': 40.16706085205078, 'longitude': -74.49987030029297, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania', 'latitude': 40.2724494934082, 'longitude': -76.90567016601562, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

Republic First Bank, which had conducted business as Republic Bank and had $6 billion in assets, is the first U.S. bank to fail this year, underscoring how some regional lenders continue to struggle a year after three regional banks failed. The Pennsylvania state regulator closed Republic Bank on Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver, which sold the bank to Fulton for an undisclosed price. Fulton acquired $4 billion of the bank's deposits and $2.9 billion in loans. The combined company now expects to have $32.8 billion in total assets and Fulton expects the deal will double its presence in the Philadelphia market. ""We anticipate improving the risk profile of the company with improved liquidity, internal capital generation, profitability and earnings,"" Fulton's CEO Curtis Myers said in an investor conference on Monday. Fulton's management said it expects to receive roughly $1 billion from the FDIC as part of the transaction terms. Its stock was last up 8% in afternoon trading Republic Bank, which had been targeted by multiple activist investors since 2021, had struggled amid elevated interest rates, which had depressed the value of securities on its balance sheet and hurt its commercial real estate portfolio that accounts for about 45% of its loan book. Its shares were delisted from the Nasdaq in August and had since been trading over the counter. The bank cut jobs in May 2023 to reduce costs and exited its mortgage origination business, and in September announced it was entering into a $35 million capital infusion deal with an activist investor group led by veteran businessman George Norcross. But that deal fell through in February. Regulators had reportedly been discussing a sale of the bank before the deal was signed. INDUSTRY STRESS Investors have been worried about the health of regional lenders since Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic and Signature Bank collapsed in early 2023 following depositor runs, although the market took Friday's news in its stride. The KBW regional banking index was last down marginally in early afternoon trading. ""There is always the danger that some bank somewhere unwittingly – or wittingly – takes too much of what turns out to be the wrong risk at the wrong time, while the rise of internet banking does make it so much easier for deposits, and any bad news, to move so much more quickly,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""The key to maintaining confidence is to keep depositors whole."" Fulton also launched an offering of its common stock and said it intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including supporting ""new opportunities"" from the acquisition. It intends to sell roughly 16.7 million shares priced at $15 apiece to raise about $250 million. Myers said the deal was not contingent on the bank raising capital. ""Capital raise was not required, the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) approved our bid based on bank level capital as is, not even the holding company,"" he added. Fulton disclosed office loans - a sector in stress as buildings run empty post-pandemic - accounted for roughly $200 million of Republic Bank's total loan book. The FDIC took some losses on Republic Bank's securities, which were then transferred to Fulton at fair value, executives said. Analysts at Jefferies said they expect the integration to be smooth and boost the bank's liquidity, even though this is the largest deal Fulton has undertaken post the global financial crisis. Through previous close, it had a market capitalization of $2.53 billion. The FDIC estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund related to the failure of Republic Bank would be $667 million.

It is business as usual for Republic account holders after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) said Friday it had seized the Lancaster, Pa.based bank, which did business as Republic Bank. It had roughly $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits as of Jan. 31. As soon as Saturday Republic Bank depositors will become Fulton depositors. They do not need to change anything with their account to retain their federally insured deposit insurance coverage. Uninterrupted access to Republic accounts Fulton in a statement said Republic Bank depositors will continue to have uninterrupted access to their accounts through online banking or by writing checks, using existing ATMs or debit cards. “With this transaction, we are excited to double our presence across the region,” said Fulton Chairman and CEO Curt Myers. “We look forward to welcoming Republic Bank’s team members and customers to Fulton and providing our comprehensive set of consumer, commercial and wealth advisory products and services to even more customers.” Myers did not disclose if any current Republic branches will be closed or employees laid off. It is the first bank failure of 2024 in the United States. Deal disappears The beginning of the end for Republic came in February when a group of investors led by South Jersey businessman and politician George Norcross III backed out of a deal to invest $35 million in the bank created in 1988, according to coverage by the Philadelphia Inquirer. Norcross had concerns when Republic did not file financial reports going back to 2022 or hold a shareholder meeting. Republic has 32 branches in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Fulton operates 200 financial centers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia.

First Republic Beats on -40.8% Deposits; Whirlpool Outperforms - Yahoo Movies Canada,First Republic Beats on -40.8% Deposits; Whirlpool Outperforms  Yahoo Movies Canada,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 00:09:12 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvZmlyc3QtcmVwdWJsaWMtYmVhdHMtNDAtOC0yMjAxMTA1NDcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Movies Canada,"Continued cautious trading habits led off a new week of trading, the same as we’ve basically been enduring over the past week-plus. With so many crucial earnings reports ands some major economic prints awaiting us this week, it’s understandable that market participants would be playing it close to the vest. The Dow gained 66 points on the session, +0.20%, while the S&P 500 went up just +0.09%. The Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 were down for the day, -0.29% and -0.15%, respectively.Minutes after the closing bell today, First Republic FRC — the San Francisco-based bank that looked in harms way five weeks ago — reported better-than-expected Q1 results on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $1.23 per share were well ahead of the anticipated $0.72, with revenues in the quarter reaching $1.21 billion, outpacing the Zacks consensus $1.13 billion. At first glance, this would appear to be as good a report as investors could have expected.However, deposit numbers — which analysts expected would be key ahead of the report’s release — were far below expectations: $104 billion versus $145 billion consensus and the $176 billion in Q4. This amounts to a -40.8% drop in deposits quarter over quarter, and includes the $30 billion of deposits from a consortium of other financial insitutions. Shares of FRC plummeted -13% on this news, but have since clawed back to -5% from Monday’s closing price, which had been +12% ahead of the earnings report.Other elements in this report include First Republic announcing job cuts of 20-25% of its workforce and a reduction in executive compensation moving forward. Considering the circumstances of the past month or so, to see the banks deposits having stabilized in the last week of Q1 may portend to better days ahead, as was its growth in Wealth Management of +6.7%. Overall, things still don’t look rosy at First Republic, but so far in Q1 earnings season, we don’t see its issues affecting the entire banking industry.Household appliances giant Whirlpool WHR also posted Q1 earnings results after today’s close, and it also outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines. For earnings, the company brought $2.66 per share, bettering the expected $2.14 but well behind the $5.31 per share from the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $4.65 billion surpassed the Zacks consensus $4.55 billion on an improving North American market. The durable goods staple reaffirmed full-year guidance for now, even with the Q1 beats.Tomorrow, aside from Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL posting quarterly earnings, we’ll also see results from Archer-Daniels-Midland ADM, Chipotle CMG, General Electric GE, General Motors GM, McDonald’s MCD, PepsiCo PEP, UPS UPS and Visa V. We’ll continue in this manner for most of the rest of the week, and will have a much more articulate view of earnings season as a whole than we do now.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

Republic First Bancorp Seized and Sold to Fulton Bank Amid Regional Banking Struggles By Quiver Quantitative - Investing.com Canada,Republic First Bancorp Seized and Sold to Fulton Bank Amid Regional Banking Struggles By Quiver Quantitative  Investing.com Canada,"Sun, 28 Apr 2024 19:19:27 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2NhLmludmVzdGluZy5jb20vbmV3cy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtbmV3cy9yZXB1YmxpYy1maXJzdC1iYW5jb3JwLXNlaXplZC1hbmQtc29sZC10by1mdWx0b24tYmFuay1hbWlkLXJlZ2lvbmFsLWJhbmtpbmctc3RydWdnbGVzLTMzNzE2NTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Investing.com Canada,"Quiver Quantitative - The regional banking sector faced another significant disruption as U.S. regulators intervened to seize Philadelphia-based Republic First Bancorp (FRBK), subsequently facilitating its sale to Fulton Bank, a unit of Fulton Financial Corp (FULT). This move reflects ongoing concerns in the banking sector, highlighting vulnerabilities similar to those that led to the collapse of notable banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank last year. Republic First, which operated under the brand Republic Bank, found itself in dire straits after a failed funding attempt with a group of investors, leading to its seizure by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the appointment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) as the receiver. Fulton Bank's acquisition of Republic Bank includes taking over roughly $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in deposits as of January 31, 2024. The transaction, which effectively doubles Fulton’s footprint in the Philadelphia area, is seen as a strategic expansion to strengthen its market presence. The deal also involves Republic’s liabilities, which include about $1.3 billion in borrowings and other obligations. This acquisition marks a significant increase in scale for Fulton, with its combined company deposits in the region growing to approximately $8.6 billion. Market Overview: -U.S. regulators seize Republic First Bancorp due to financial difficulties. -Fulton Bank acquires Republic Bank's assets and deposits to bolster its presence in the Philadelphia market. -This incident highlights ongoing challenges faced by regional banks after previous collapses. Key Points: -Republic First, struggling with funding issues, gets seized by Pennsylvania regulators. -The FDIC appoints Fulton Bank to assume Republic Bank's assets and deposits, protecting depositors. -The deal strengthens Fulton Bank's regional footprint, nearly doubling its deposit base. Looking Ahead: -Republic Bank branches will reopen under Fulton Bank's banner, ensuring continuity for customers. -This seizure underscores the vulnerability of some regional banks, potentially prompting further consolidation. -The long-term health of the regional banking sector remains a concern. The transition will see Republic Bank’s 32 branches across New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York reopening under the Fulton Bank banner. This seamless transition aims to ensure minimal disruption for customers and preserve confidence in the regional banking system amid growing anxieties about the health of smaller banks. The FDIC estimates that the failure of Republic Bank will cost its insurance fund $667 million, indicating the financial impact of the bank’s downfall.

Republic First Bank, which had conducted business as Republic Bank and had $6 billion in assets, is the first U.S. bank to fail this year, underscoring how some regional lenders continue to struggle a year after three regional banks failed. The Pennsylvania state regulator closed Republic Bank on Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver, which sold the bank to Fulton for an undisclosed price. Fulton acquired $4 billion of the bank's deposits and $2.9 billion in loans. The combined company now expects to have $32.8 billion in total assets and Fulton expects the deal will double its presence in the Philadelphia market. ""We anticipate improving the risk profile of the company with improved liquidity, internal capital generation, profitability and earnings,"" Fulton's CEO Curtis Myers said in an investor conference on Monday. Fulton's management said it expects to receive roughly $1 billion from the FDIC as part of the transaction terms. Its stock was last up 8% in afternoon trading Republic Bank, which had been targeted by multiple activist investors since 2021, had struggled amid elevated interest rates, which had depressed the value of securities on its balance sheet and hurt its commercial real estate portfolio that accounts for about 45% of its loan book. Its shares were delisted from the Nasdaq in August and had since been trading over the counter. The bank cut jobs in May 2023 to reduce costs and exited its mortgage origination business, and in September announced it was entering into a $35 million capital infusion deal with an activist investor group led by veteran businessman George Norcross. But that deal fell through in February. Regulators had reportedly been discussing a sale of the bank before the deal was signed. INDUSTRY STRESS Investors have been worried about the health of regional lenders since Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic and Signature Bank collapsed in early 2023 following depositor runs, although the market took Friday's news in its stride. The KBW regional banking index was last down marginally in early afternoon trading. ""There is always the danger that some bank somewhere unwittingly – or wittingly – takes too much of what turns out to be the wrong risk at the wrong time, while the rise of internet banking does make it so much easier for deposits, and any bad news, to move so much more quickly,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""The key to maintaining confidence is to keep depositors whole."" Fulton also launched an offering of its common stock and said it intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including supporting ""new opportunities"" from the acquisition. It intends to sell roughly 16.7 million shares priced at $15 apiece to raise about $250 million. Myers said the deal was not contingent on the bank raising capital. ""Capital raise was not required, the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) approved our bid based on bank level capital as is, not even the holding company,"" he added. Fulton disclosed office loans - a sector in stress as buildings run empty post-pandemic - accounted for roughly $200 million of Republic Bank's total loan book. The FDIC took some losses on Republic Bank's securities, which were then transferred to Fulton at fair value, executives said. Analysts at Jefferies said they expect the integration to be smooth and boost the bank's liquidity, even though this is the largest deal Fulton has undertaken post the global financial crisis. Through previous close, it had a market capitalization of $2.53 billion. The FDIC estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund related to the failure of Republic Bank would be $667 million.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) stepped in as receiver, announcing an agreement for Fulton Bank to assume Republic First’s deposits and purchase substantially all of its assets. The move comes after Republic First, based in Philadelphia, had abandoned efforts to secure new funding from investors. The bank had roughly $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits as of January 31st. Its stock price had plummeted to just 1 cent by Friday, down from over $2 at the start of 2024. Under the deal, Fulton Bank, a subsidiary of Fulton Financial Corp (Nasdaq: FULT), will take on Republic First’s 32 branches across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. The branches are set to reopen as Fulton Bank locations this weekend or on Monday. Fulton stated the acquisition will nearly double its presence in the Philadelphia market, with combined deposits of around $8.6 billion. For the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund, the failure of Republic First is estimated to cost $667 million. The agency guarantees up to $250,000 per depositor at insured banks. Republic First’s demise continues the upheaval in the regional banking sector that began last March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. That was quickly followed by the failures of Signature Bank and First Republic Bank in the following months. While far smaller than those three lenders, Republic First had struggled with profitability issues. It exited the mortgage business last year and saw a deal for a $35 million cash infusion from investors led by businessman George Norcross fall apart in February. The seizure indicates lingering strains for midsize banks a year after the crisis raised concerns over their stability and access to funding. Regulators have had to intervene repeatedly to protect depositors and the wider system. Information for this story was found via Reuters, Forbes, and the sources and companies mentioned.

Quick Read Republic First Bank Closure: Regulators have shut down Republic First Bank, a regional bank with operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. The bank, which had assets of about $6 billion and deposits totaling approximately $4 billion as of January 31, was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) on Friday. Acquisition by Fulton Bank: Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based Fulton Bank will assume almost all the deposits and purchase virtually all the assets of the failed bank. Republic Bank’s 32 branches will reopen under the Fulton Bank name, starting as early as Saturday. Customer Access and FDIC Coverage: Depositors of Republic First Bank will have access to their funds via checks or ATMs starting Friday night. The closure is projected to cost the deposit insurance fund $667 million. Banking Industry Context: This marks the first FDIC-insured bank failure in the U.S. this year, with the last occurring in November. Typically, in a robust economy, only four to five banks close annually. However, challenges such as rising interest rates and the decline in commercial real estate values, particularly post-pandemic, are exacerbating financial risks for regional and community banks. The Associated Press has the story: Regulators close Philadelphia-based Republic First Bank, 1st US bank failure this year Newslooks- WASHINGTON (AP) — Regulators have closed Republic First Bank, a regional lender operating in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Friday it had seized the Philadelphia-based bank, which did business as Republic Bank and had roughly $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits as of Jan. 31. Fulton Bank, which is based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, agreed to assume substantially all of the failed bank’s deposits and buy essentially all of its assets, the agency said. Republic Bank’s 32 branches will reopen as branches of Fulton Bank as early as Saturday. Republic First Bank depositors can access their funds via checks or ATMs as early as Friday night, the FDIC said. The bank’s failure is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund $667 million. The lender is the first FDIC-insured institution to fail in the U.S. this year. The last bank failure — Citizens Bank, based in Sac City, Iowa — was in November. In a strong economy an average of only four or five banks close each year. Rising interest rates and falling commercial real estate values, especially for office buildings grappling with surging vacancy rates following the pandemic, have heightened the financial risks for many regional and community banks. Outstanding loans backed by properties that have lost value make them a challenge to refinance. Last month, an investor group including Steven Mnuchin, who served as U.S. Treasury secretary during the Trump administration, agreed to pump more than $1 billion to rescue New York Community Bancorp, which has been hammered by weakness in commercial real estate and growing pains resulting from its buyout of a distressed bank.",https://www.newslooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AP24117855155749.jpg,2024-04-27,-0.312,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Fulton Bank', 'description': 'regional financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'Fulton Bank'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.962581634521484, 'longitude': -79.876708984375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania', 'latitude': 40.2724494934082, 'longitude': -76.90567016601562, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Jersey', 'latitude': 40.16706085205078, 'longitude': -74.49987030029297, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Lancaster', 'latitude': 40.037879943847656, 'longitude': -76.30551147460938, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'WASHINGTON', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sac City', 'latitude': 42.42219924926758, 'longitude': -94.98970794677734, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Iowa', 'latitude': 42.00027084350586, 'longitude': -93.50048828125, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S. Treasury', 'latitude': 33.32728958129883, 'longitude': -107.71475982666016, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Trump', 'latitude': 39.68233108520508, 'longitude': -76.60218811035156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'York', 'latitude': 53.9576301574707, 'longitude': -1.0827100276947021, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"Republic First Bank, a regional lender with $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits, has been closed by regulators.

The closure has sparked heated reactions within the cryptocurrency community, leading to a noticeable dip in Bitcoin, Ether, and other altcoins. Crypto Market Reacts as Republic First Bank Faces Regulatory Shutdown In a recent report by CoinGape, United States regulators have closed Philadelphia-based Republic First Bank, the country's first financial collapse in 2024. It has caused disagreement among the crypto community, with Bitcoin, Ether, and many altcoins falling somewhat in response to the news. “Another bank just collapsed, the Republic First Bank. Yeah... I think I'll stick to Bitcoin,” CEO of Zesh Marius Martocsan stated in an April 26 post on X. “Republic First Bank failure is worth a look since bank failures are the best possible narrative we can get for crypto,” pseudonymous crypto trader Pillage Capital claimed in an April 26 post on X. “How many more need to fail before people start to be their own bank?” crypto commentator Randi Hipper asked her 87,100 X followers on April 26. On April 26, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities seized Republic First, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as receiver. According to an FDIC announcement issued on April 26, the agency will take over nearly all of Republic Bank's depositors and assets. Republic First to Reopen Under Fulton as Crypto Markets Continue Volatile Response Republic First has about $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in total deposits as of January 31. Furthermore, at the latest, the bank's 32 locations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York will reopen under Fulton Bank's cover by the beginning of next week. Even reports of impending bank failures caused a brief increase in Bitcoin's price in 2023, although it has fallen slightly. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin was down 1.16% in the last hour, trading at $62,715, and Ether was down 0.58%, trading at $3,095. Meanwhile, altcoins have experienced a significantly bigger drop in the same period, with Dogecoin down 2.88% and Solana down 1.79%. According to FDIC data, the revelation comes after a difficult year for the banking industry, with five bank failures reported in the United States in 2023. First Republic Bank, a distinct institution unrelated to Republic First, was acquired by JPMorgan in May 2023 after early recovery efforts failed.

This failure has sparked debate within the crypto community about promoting Bitcoin, Ether, and other altcoins, which have been severely affected by the news. CEO of Zesh Marius Martocsan shared an X post on April 26, stating, “Another bank just collapsed, the Republic First Bank. Yeah… I think I’ll stick to Bitcoin.” On April 26, another X (formerly Twitter) user and a crypto commentator, Randi Hipper, asked her 87,100 X followers how many more banks will fail before people start being their bank. FDIC Seizes Operations Of Republic First Bank On April 26, Federal Deposit Insurance was appointed receiver after the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities seized its operations. According to an FDIC statement published on April 26, the insurance agency will take on nearly all deposits and acquire Republic Bank’s assets. Per the balance sheet reported on January 31, 2024, Republic First Bank had approximately $6 Billion in total assets and $4 Billion in total deposits. Moreover, the thirty-two branches of the bank were spread across New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. These branches will restart their operations under the banking umbrella of Fulton Bank. The operations will begin at the latest by the start of next week. Here’s How Cryptos Reacted To Republic’s Failure In early 2023, rumors of banking failures led to a significant increase in the price of Bitcoin in a short period. However, when the news confirmed that multiple banks failed, BTC took a sharp hit. Reports of the Republic’s First’s collapse hurt Bitcoin, which went down 1.16% to $62,715. However, the trades regained momentum and were trading at around $62,958 (at the time of writing), 2.20% down from the previous day. Ether is also down by approximately 0.85% from the previous day and is currently trading at $3,115.60. Around the same time, altcoins have also experienced a slightly higher decline in the same timeframe. Dogecoin has declined by 4.17%, trading at $0.1449. Solana has also decreased by 5.63%, trading at $136.15. How The US Banking Industry Reacted It’s a rough year for the industry. Republic First Bank’s failure is an eerie reminder of the early 2023 market downturn. The FDIC dealt with five banking failures in last year’s scare. The failure of so many banks will substantially affect the country’s banking industry and the overall economy. Such shortcomings will also dampen customers’ trust in the country’s banking system. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve announced the closure of Signature Bank to protect the U.S. economy and avoid systemic risk. The announcement came just a few days after the closing of Silicon Valley Bank. A week before that, another famous crypto-friendly bank, Silvergate Bank, announced that it would stop its operations and process voluntary liquidation. Notably, First Republic Bank, a separate legal entity from Republic First, was acquired by an investment banking firm and a conglomerate, JPMorgan, in May 2023. It was acquired after the failure of initial recovery efforts.",https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Republic-First-Bank-closed-by-US-regulators-—-crypto-community-reacts.webp,2024-04-27,-0.09,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Twitter', 'description': 'American social networking site', 'full_name': 'Twitter', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Capturadeteledacontadawikipedianotwitter.png'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Billion', 'description': 'provider of network equipment and power supply products', 'full_name': 'Billion', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Billionlogo.png'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Fulton Bank', 'description': 'regional financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'Fulton Bank'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ether', 'latitude': 35.43986129760742, 'longitude': -79.78392791748047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania Department of Banking', 'latitude': 40.26028060913086, 'longitude': -76.88263702392578, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Jersey', 'latitude': 40.16706085205078, 'longitude': -74.49987030029297, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania', 'latitude': 40.2724494934082, 'longitude': -76.90567016601562, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Solana', 'latitude': 46.317718505859375, 'longitude': -93.15326690673828, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities seized Republic First Bank, a Philadelphia-based lender with $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in deposits as of January 31, on April 26, 2024. This marks the first US bank failure of the year, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) stepping in to arrange the transfer of substantially all deposits and assets to Fulton Bank. Republic First’s 32 branches across New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York will reopen under the Fulton Bank name by the start of next week. The FDIC estimates the cost of this failure to its deposit insurance fund at approximately $667 million. Banking Woes Continue Republic First Bank is the fourth US regional bank failure since March 2023. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank within months of each other caused significant tremors in the traditional financial sector. This latest seizure underscores the ongoing challenges many smaller banks face in the current economic landscape. The string of bank failures has reignited discussions about the stability of the banking industry. As of January 31, 2024, Republic First held approximately $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits. FDIC insurance will protect depositors up to the legal limits. Crypto Community Reacts to Bank Failure Republic First Bank’s closure sent shockwaves through the crypto community on social media. Many users questioned the traditional banking system’s security. This latest failure follows a string of collapses in 2023 – Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. The repeated bank closures have shaken trust in the traditional financial sector. Marius Martocsan, CEO of Zesh, expressed his preference for Bitcoin following the news. Pillage Capital highlighted the narrative potential of bank failures for cryptocurrency adoption. Crypto commentator Randi Hipper questioned how many banks need to fail before people realize the benefits of self-custody in crypto.

Following the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities’ seizure of Republic First on Friday (April 26), the FDIC stepped in as the receiver. In a statement issued on the same day, the FDIC announced its acquisition of all of Republic Bank’s assets and the majority of its deposits. Recent hours have seen Bitcoin and Ether experience a slight decline, trading at $62,715 and $3,095 respectively, according to CoinMarketCap. Altcoins, however, have seen a more significant drop, with Dogecoin falling by 2.88% and Solana’s value decreasing by 1.79%. Despite the challenges, the banking sector demonstrated resilience in 2023, with five banks in the United States facing closure, according to data provided by FDIC. JPMorgan Chase & Co. purchased First Republic Bank in May of 2023, following the failure of early efforts to recover the bank. First Republic Bank is an independent corporation that is not affiliated with Republic First. Because of the systemic risk that it posed to the economy of the United States, the Federal Reserve made the announcement in March 2023 that Signature Bank would be shut down. Nevertheless, that is only the tip of the iceberg: the news came just a few days after the Silicon Valley Bank was given the order to quit operations.

Its collapse is expected to cost the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund $667 million. However, the FDIC stated that Fulton Bank’s acquisition was the least costly resolution option available. Republic’s branches will reopen as Fulton Bank locations starting Saturday, with depositors able to access their funds via ATMs, checks, and banking as usual.“Depositors of Republic Bank will become depositors of Fulton Bank, so customers do not need to change their banking relationship,” the FDIC announced, ensuring all deposits remain insured up to $250,000 per account.While an uncommon occurrence in a strong economy, the failure of Republic First Bank shows that there are heightened risks facing some regional and community banks amid rising interest rates and deteriorating commercial real estate values, especially for office properties.Just last month, an investor group led by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin injected over $1 billion to rescue embattled New York Community Bancorp from similar pressures.In the meantime, customers with questions can contact the FDIC helpline at 1-877-467-0178 during the specified hours (Eastern Time) below.

Fulton Bank will also take on all deposits previously held by the Republic. Republic First Bank, operating regionally in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, operated under the name Republic Bank and boasted approximately $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits as of January 31. The 32 branches of Republic Bank will reopen as Fulton Bank branches as early as Saturday, ensuring continued access to funds for Republic First Bank depositors via checks or ATMs starting Friday night, according to the FDIC. Customers with Republic Bank ATM or debit cards, as well as checks, can continue using them, while those with loans from Republic should maintain regular payment schedules. While the bank’s collapse is projected to incur a $667 million expense to the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC deemed Fulton Bank’s acquisition of Republic First Bank to be the most cost-effective solution.

U.S Regulators Closes down Republic First Bank - Techstory,U.S Regulators Closes down Republic First Bank  Techstory,"Sat, 27 Apr 2024 17:08:56 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHN0b3J5LmluL3Utcy1yZWd1bGF0b3JzLWNsb3Nlcy1kb3duLXJlcHVibGljLWZpcnN0LWJhbmstc3BhcmtzLWRlYmF0ZS1pbi1jcnlwdG8td29ybGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Techstory,"The closure of Philadelphia based Republic First Bank by U.S. regulators has spurred a dialogue within the crypto community, prompting considerations about the role of conventional banking and the allure of cryptocurrencies. As the inaugural banking failure of 2024, this event sheds light on the resilience of decentralized financial systems and their capacity to offer alternatives to traditional banking methods. The Bank's Closure and Transition Following the seizure of Republic First Bank by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) stepped in as the receiver. With assets totaling around $6 billion and deposits reaching $4 billion, the bank's closure marks a significant event in the financial landscape. The transition of its 32 branches across New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York to Fulton Bank's management signifies a significant change for both customers and employees. Reactions from the Crypto Community Republic First Bank's closure has evoked varied responses within the crypto community. Some perceive it as validation of cryptocurrencies' disruptive potential in the traditional banking sector. Zesh Marius Martocsan, CEO, expressed skepticism towards traditional banks, favoring Bitcoin as a more reliable alternative. Likewise, Pillage Capital highlighted the importance of banking failures in reinforcing the case for crypto adoption, suggesting that such events may drive individuals towards alternative financial solutions. Debating Decentralization The bank's closure has reignited discussions on decentralization and individual financial sovereignty. Randi Hipper, a crypto commentator, questioned the necessity of traditional banking institutions in light of recurring banking failures, urging her followers to contemplate the benefits of becoming their own bank. This sentiment aligns with the broader trend within the crypto community, advocating for decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions that empower individuals to manage their financial assets without reliance on traditional intermediaries. The closure of Republic First Bank has had implications in the financial markets, with slight fluctuations observed in major cryptocurrency prices post-announcement. While Bitcoin and Ether experienced modest declines, altcoins like Dogecoin and Solana saw slightly larger slumps during the same period. These fluctuations underscore the interconnectedness of traditional financial systems and cryptocurrencies, showcasing the potential for crypto assets to serve as alternative investments amidst economic uncertainty. Republic First Bank's closure adds to a series of banking failures in the U.S. in recent years, highlighting ongoing challenges within the industry. In 2023 alone, five banking failures were recorded, indicating systemic issues necessitating regulatory intervention. This closure follows similar events involving other financial institutions, including JPMorgan's acquisition of First Republic Bank and the closures of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. The closure of Republic First Bank raises pertinent questions about the future of banking and the role of cryptocurrencies in reshaping financial systems. As traditional banks face heightened scrutiny and regulatory challenges, cryptocurrencies offer alternative avenues for financial inclusion and innovation. Continued dialogue and collaboration between traditional finance and the crypto community are essential to navigate evolving regulatory landscapes and foster greater financial resilience. Republic First Bank's closure marks a pivotal moment for traditional banking institutions and the broader financial ecosystem. As the crypto community reflects on the implications of banking failures, the event underscores the need for innovation and adaptation within the banking industry. With cryptocurrencies presenting new opportunities for decentralization and financial sovereignty, Republic First Bank's closure may catalyze broader discussions on the future of banking and the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in shaping it.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/109642218.png,2024-04-27,0.331,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Fulton Bank', 'description': 'regional financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'Fulton Bank'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania Department of Banking', 'latitude': 40.26028060913086, 'longitude': -76.88263702392578, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Jersey', 'latitude': 40.16706085205078, 'longitude': -74.49987030029297, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pennsylvania', 'latitude': 40.2724494934082, 'longitude': -76.90567016601562, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ether', 'latitude': 35.43986129760742, 'longitude': -79.78392791748047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Solana', 'latitude': 46.317718505859375, 'longitude': -93.15326690673828, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,Not-related content.

Republic First Bank had about $6 billion in assets and $4 billion in deposits at the end of January.

Last year, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic – not to be confused with Republic First Bank – collapsed as a result.
