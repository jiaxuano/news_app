This prevented First Republic from being put into receivership under the FDIC, as had happened with the failed Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in mid-March. It also prevents authorities from implementing emergency measures as they did for the other two to shore up the US banking sector. However, late last year, JP Morgan Chase announced the closure of twenty-two First Republic branches, bringing the total down to 62. These closures had been reported earlier that year as executives at JP Morgan began to evaluate the health of the bank they had acquired and the changes that would need to be made to bring the bank back into the green as it was integrated into their operations. JP Morgan Chase identified the initial branches selected for closure as “locations that have relatively low transaction volumes and are generally within a short drive from another First Republic office,” according to a statement provided by the bank. Last week, data published by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reported nine additional closures. No timeline has been placed on when these locations will shutter their doors, but thanks to data from the federal agency that oversees these processes and many others, we know they are coming. Where are the branches closing? All affected branches are located in California, with the majority found in the Bay Area, in and around San Fransisco. The closures will affect a total of nine branches: With these closures, the number of First Republic branches will fall to fifty-three. Over time, all of these branches will be absorbed into the Chase ecosystem and be rebranded to avoid confusion.",https://img.asmedia.epimg.net/resizer/v2/YLWF5GEY7RPU6TOCNXQWJFPRTA.jpg?auth=d559198a3e7a21d7d92ea53cb91d2fe530fa5608a1d1d220b39db9f93087d04d&width=1472&height=828&focal=2914%2C698,2024-02-28,-0.226,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 43.00035095214844, 'longitude': -75.4999008178711, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bay', 'latitude': 38.50838088989258, 'longitude': -91.55850219726562, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Fransisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chase', 'latitude': 36.54169845581055, 'longitude': -104.9255599975586, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Not directly related,"- JP Morgan acquired First Republic Bank last spring, preventing it from being put into receivership.

An activist group, led by insurance executive George Norcross, lawyer Philip Norcross and former TD Bank CEO Greg Braca, said this week that it would call off a planned investment in the beleaguered Republic First. The drawn-out and often contentious saga involving Republic First Bancorp in Philadelphia and an activist group hit another twist this week. A planned capital raise fell through. The Norcross-Braca group — led by insurance executive George Norcross, lawyer Philip Norcross and former TD Bank CEO Greg Braca — had for the past two years complained of the $6 billion-asset Republic First's substandard profitability and stock performance. The activist investor had pushed for management and board changes, among other efforts for strategic shifts and transparency, and ultimately last September announced a deal to invest at least $35 million in common stock and securities in the bank. That plan, had it come to fruition, would have bolstered Republic First's capital position and ended a lengthy Norcross-Braca proxy contest. However, the deal required the bank to first raise $40 million from third-party investors, issue a long-delayed 10-K regulatory filing for 2022 and hold an annual meeting with shareholders. In a statement issued late Wednesday, the Norcross-Braca group cited the bank's ""failure"" to ""take actions and satisfy closing conditions,"" including filing the 10-K and hosting the meeting, as reasons to terminate the deal. The group noted the deadline for completion of the deal had previously been extended from Nov. 30 to today. The group did not provide more detail and said it would not comment further on the nixed agreement. The Norcross-Braca group has wrestled for control of Republic First since early 2022. Republic First, the parent of Republic Bank, did not delve into detail either. But it confirmed the deal was canceled in a regulatory filing and provided an emailed statement to American Banker noting that it was not reliant on the Norcross-Braca capital raise. ""Our strategic plan has been designed to be executed even without the investment announced last fall. We have continued to maintain the bank's adequately capitalized position, and believe we have a strong deposit base and ample liquidity,"" Republic First said. ""As previously disclosed,"" the company added, ""we engaged Wolf & Company for 2022, 2023 and 2024 to support us in getting current with our annual and periodic financial reporting obligations and believe this is key for us and investors in considering opportunities for growth capital in the future."" Republic First has made multiple attempts to raise capital over the past year and shore up its finances. These included an early 2023 plan to raise a total of $125 million in partnership with Castle Creek that was later canceled. Community banking Republic First got a hand up from investors. Is it out of the woods? October 31, 2023 4:07 PM These efforts followed infighting on the bank's board and changes in leadership. Current President and CEO Thomas Geisel joined Republic First in December 2022 to lead a turnaround. Last year, he announced plans to quit originating mortgages, streamline commercial lending in New York and curb expenses elsewhere. In a statement late last year, Geisel said ""our team continues to work on making sustainable process and operational efficiency improvements, while maintaining Republic Bank's focus on providing a high level of service and responsiveness for our customers and communities."" Republic First posted a fourth-quarter loss of $42.7 million, according to its latest call report. For the quarter ended Sept. 30 of last year, the company reported a loss of $29.8 million.

Banks are still grappling with fallout of SVB's failure one year on - Marketplace,Banks are still grappling with fallout of SVB's failure one year on  Marketplace,"Mon, 11 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHBsYWNlLm9yZy8yMDI0LzAzLzExL2Jhbmtpbmctc3lzdGVtLXNpbGljb24tdmFsbGV5LXNpZ25hdHVyZS1iYW5rLWZhaWx1cmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Marketplace,"One year ago Sunday, Silicon Valley Bank failed. Two days later, Signature Bank collapsed. And later in the spring, First Republic Bank failed as well. Government intervention played a big role in containing the fallout from the collapses. But one year on, the banking system is still feeling a lot of reverberations. The whole banking system was caught off guard by the problems at the three midsized institutions — especially regulators, said Kathryn Judge, a law professor at Columbia University. But now? “We have regulators who are on high alert for the possibility of problems and are actively working to try to make sure they understand where sources of fragility might exist,” she said. For instance, the Federal Reserve said it’s been keeping a closer eye on commercial real estate loans since many have been showing signs of stress. There are also proposals to beef up the cushion banks have to carry to absorb losses. Overall, Judge said that regulators have learned that big banks aren’t the only ones that can threaten the financial system. “Banks the size of Signature Bank or Silicon Valley Bank have the potential to be systemically significant in a way that are going to require extraordinary action by regulators in connection with their failures,” she said. But even though the banking system is more stable now, a lot of the problems that were revealed a year ago haven’t gone away. A big one is the pressure banks face when interest rates rise, according to David Schiff, head of retail and consumer banking at West Monroe. “High interest rates, particularly the longer they stay high, mean greater operating costs, mean greater uncertainty on the balance sheet, both on the deposit side and on the lending side,” Schiff said. On the lending side, a lot of banks’ cash is tied up in loans they made back when interest rates were low. But on the deposit side, banks are paying their customers higher interest rates to keep them from running to the competition. “Banks are really struggling, particularly with small businesses, commercial institutions and high net-worth customers that have greater degrees of deposits, to prove out that the relationship is really worth it,” he said. And banks are trying other ways of keeping depositors happy. Dominik Mjartan, CEO of Optus Bank in South Carolina, said that his bank’s been looking at cutting fees for services like wire transfers and fraud protection. “We frequently have to say, ‘To win your relationship, to show you that we’re a good relationship bank, you know, we’re going to do that for very little or nothing,'” he said. Mjartan’s bank makes a lot of loans in low- and moderate-income communities. Lately, he’s been going to big banks and saying, “Hey, you want to help those communities too. So why don’t you deposit some money with us?” That strategy’s been working out. “We pay them interest on it. We send them statements. The money’s insured. We agree on a term. And I’m hoping that they continue to reinvest those funds with us every time it matures,” Mjartan said. Those deposits are allowing the bank to continue making new loans at a time when other lenders have been pulling back, he said.",https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1472600143-e1709917085248.jpg?fit=2880%2C1622&w=1200,2024-03-11,-0.275,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'David Schiff', 'description': 'composer', 'full_name': 'David Schiff'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Kathryn', 'latitude': 37.87594985961914, 'longitude': -80.97425842285156, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Columbia University', 'latitude': 40.808990478515625, 'longitude': -73.96125030517578, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Judge', 'latitude': 38.42060089111328, 'longitude': -91.78073120117188, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'West Monroe', 'latitude': 32.51847839355469, 'longitude': -92.14763641357422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Schiff', 'latitude': 51.00299072265625, 'longitude': 7.1739702224731445, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'South Carolina', 'latitude': 34.000431060791016, 'longitude': -81.00009155273438, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Hey', 'latitude': 51.89332962036133, 'longitude': 4.420829772949219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Neutral,Not-related content

JPMorgan's First Republic Makeover Bucks Branch Closure Trend - PYMNTS.com,JPMorgan's First Republic Makeover Bucks Branch Closure Trend  PYMNTS.com,"Mon, 11 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9iYW5raW5nLzIwMjMvanBtb3JnYW5zLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLW1ha2VvdmVyLWJ1Y2tzLWJyYW5jaC1jbG9zdXJlLXRyZW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,PYMNTS.com,"JPMorgan is reportedly overhauling branches acquired in the collapse of First Republic Bank. The country’s largest bank is planning to open several new branches, Reuters reported Monday (Dec. 11), going against a nationwide trend as consumers shift to digital banking. “Branches have been a winning strategy for us that is helping us capture more market share,” Jennifer Roberts, CEO of Chase Consumer Banking, said in an interview with Reuters. She added that 75% of the bank’s depositors visit a branch at least once a year. JPMorgan has more than 4,800 branches in the continental U.S., and plans to open another 167 by the year’s end, more than its earlier projection of 150, Roberts said. Reuters noted that Bank of America is also adding new branches, a reversal from a nationwide decline. American banks shuttered 123 branches and opened 80 in October, bringing the number of active bank branches at the end of that month to 77,690, the report said, citing data from S&P. And as PYMNTS wrote recently, bank earnings this quarter have suggested “some critical mass as consumers continue to use online channels to conduct at least some aspects of daily financial life.” Earnings calls for banks that include JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo show that “the branch experience itself is changing, and is being reinvented to fit more fully into an omnichannel effort to meet consumers where they want to be met,” that report said. This fall has also seen reports that bank branches in supermarkets were shutting down at a rate that is seven times higher than that of other branches. Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) showed American banks closed 10.7% of their in-store branches in the year ended June 30, and just 1.4% for other branches during the same time frame. The FDIC took over First Republic in May and sold the company’s operations to JPMorgan, following what was the second-biggest banking collapse seen since the financial crisis of 2008. When JPMorgan acquired First Republic, it added 84 branches, though it later announced plans to close 21 of those locations. “Even though there could be some branch network consolidations, the total number of new branches would be higher and you will see our branch network growing,” Roberts said.",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/first-republic-bank-3.jpg,2023-12-11,-0.402,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Citigroup', 'description': 'American investment bank and financial services corporation', 'full_name': 'Citigroup', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/388_Greenwich_Street_from_Battery_Park_City_North_Esplanade.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reuters', 'latitude': 50.67449951171875, 'longitude': 9.351499557495117, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Chase', 'latitude': 36.54169845581055, 'longitude': -104.9255599975586, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Roberts', 'latitude': 42.42692184448242, 'longitude': -94.17440795898438, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank of America', 'latitude': 37.79444122314453, 'longitude': -122.40306091308594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Positive,"- The FDIC took over First Republic in May and sold the company’s operations to JPMorgan, following what was the second-biggest banking collapse seen since the financial crisis of 2008.

In a report Friday, the FDIC found fault in how regulators in the FDIC’s San Francisco Office dealt with First Republic Bank in the years leading up to its collapse in May. Regulators ""could have been more forward-looking"" in assessing the risks that rising interest rates would pose to the bank, ""could have done more"" to challenge and encourage bank management to manage those risks, and were ""too generous"" in evaluating whether the bank had enough liquid assets on hand, according to the report. The FDIC is one of the government bodies regulating banks, alongside the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency. The FDIC’s report echoes the findings of an earlier Federal Reserve report, which found flaws in the regulatory oversight of Silicon Valley Bank before it imploded in a million-dollar-per-second bank run. SVB’s failure in March set off a chain of events that led to the collapse of First Republic. The FDIC report identified several factors that prompted the bank run that ultimately brought down First Republic: The bank grew too fast, and it relied too much on uninsured deposits and loyalty from depositors. Furthermore, during the easy-money years of the pandemic, when interest rates were ultra-low, the bank failed to prepare for what would happen if rates shot up again. That risk blew up in First Republic’s face after the Federal Reserve rapidly cranked up its benchmark interest rate beginning in March 2022 to control inflation. High interest rates reduced the value of many of First Republic’s assets, shaking depositors' confidence and inflaming the fears that led to the fatal bank run. ""We cannot say whether taking earlier supervisory action such as criticizing interest rate risk or liquidity risk management would have prevented First Republic from failing given the significance and speed of deposit withdrawals,"" the FDIC said in the report. ""However, meaningful action to mitigate interest rate risk and address funding concentrations would have made the bank more resilient and less vulnerable to the March 2023 contagion event.""Regulators have proposed a slew of rule changes in response to First Republic's and other banks' failure this spring, including requiring banks to have more of a financial buffer against losses to guard against bank runs and other risks.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/yWJIndW1MVUbIF1c8cgWXxKRjrY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1495191906-38f8c68a74644a7d96cc14f9632c3fcc.jpg,2023-09-11,-0.255,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"- The FDIC report found fault in how regulators dealt with First Republic Bank in the years leading up to its collapse in May, citing a lack of forward-looking risk assessment, insufficient challenge to bank management, and overly generous evaluation of liquid assets.

1st Century Hires Former First Republic Bankers - Los Angeles Business Journal,1st Century Hires Former First Republic Bankers  Los Angeles Business Journal,"Mon, 16 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvMXN0LWNlbnR1cnktaGlyZXMtZm9ybWVyLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLWJhbmtlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Los Angeles Business Journal,"Another bank has moved in on the clientele left shaken by the regional banking crisis. 1st Century Bancorp Inc., a division of Midland Financial Co., the holding company for the largest private bank in the country, MidFirst Bank, is expanding into new markets by hiring 22 former First Republic bankers. Former First Republic regional managing directors will open 1st Century branches in the South Bay, Santa Barbara and San Diego, and the bank hopes their existing client networks will trust a new, private employer after their former bank sustained a disastrous public bank run this March. In addition to top directors overseeing new outposts statewide, 1st Century also brings in new vice presidents and an executive, who will work out of its Century City headquarters. According to 1st Century’s founder and president, Jason DiNapoli, the company has been eyeing expansion for a long time but needed a market opening to justify the cost of growth. With public banks hunkering down under shareholder pressure in an uncertain market, 1st Century found its moment. “A lot of banks have sort of stopped or maybe retreated,” DiNapoli said. “We see this as an opportunity to grow.” Another player recently encroached on the West Coast wealthy both First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank left searching for new wealth-management options. Last month, First Citizens Bancshares Inc., the acquirer of Silicon Valley’s assets, announced 11 wealth advisors had moved into the Los Angeles area targeting growing-net-worth individuals. According to 1st Century’s announcement, the bank looks to attract the same high net-worth deposits that both built and depleted First Republic Bank. The deposits, often well over the $250,000 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. limit for protection, came from clients like entrepreneurs, real estate investors and private equity players. While this customer base grew its wealth management practice to $271.2 billion in assets in 2022, the same high-profile clientele withdrew more than $100 billion within a matter of days following Silicon Valley’s collapse in March. This run drained the bank’s last-minute bailout from the private sector and spurred what is now the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. Earl Crawford, who served as a senior credit officer on the First Republic executive loan committee, now works out of Century City as 1st Century’s credit executive. It was this loan committee that approved First Republic’s large loan campaign while interest rates were low during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. When interest rates jumped last year the value of these loans dropped, scrapping the chance a capital raise could shore up its balance sheet. DiNapoli believes the bankers he hired did their job well at First Republic and can salvage potential broken trust through the reassurance that his bank’s private status remains immune to public market panic. “Being private, being out of the news cycle, really made sure we didn’t have the same problems,” DiNapoli said. Prior to its collapse, First Republic had an expansive network in Los Angeles. The bank had $12.8 billion in deposits in Los Angeles County last year, according to Business Journal rankings. This exceeded Midfirst Bank’s size nearly seven-fold, as 1st Century’s parent company reported $1.9 billion in deposits in the local area last year. Midfirst acquired 1st Century in 2016, after the latter grew to a $732 million entity while public on the New York Stock Exchange. 1st Century still operates five branches under its name throughout Los Angeles County.

Miklos Daniel Brody, 38, pleaded guilty in April 2023 to two charges that he violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by obtaining information from a protected computer and by intentionally damaging a protected computer and one charge of making false statements to a government agency, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California said in a statement. According to prosecutors, Brody worked as a cloud engineer for First Republic Bank, which is headquartered in San Francisco, until March 2020 when he was fired for violating company policy. Based on a superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury in December 2022, he used his company-issued laptop -- which he did not return after being fired -- to access the bank's computer network to cause substantial damage. Prosecutors said Brody deleted the bank's code repositories, ran a malicious script to delete logs, left taunts within the bank's code for ex-colleagues, and impersonated other bank employees by opening sessions in their names. The superseding indictment also noted that he emailed himself a proprietary bank code that he had worked on as an employee valued at over $5,000. According to prosecutors, the total cost of the damage to the bank's systems is at least $220,621. in the days and weeks that followed his firing, Brody also filed a police report, lying to the San Francisco Police Department that his company-issued laptop was stolen from his car while he was working out at a gym.

Former First Republic Bank executives under FDIC investigation - Yahoo Finance,Former First Republic Bank executives under FDIC investigation  Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 02 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3JtZXItZmlyc3QtcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1leGVjdXRpdmVzLTExNDIwMTQxMC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance,"First Republic Bank executives are under investigation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for potential misconduct, Reuters reported. ""We can confirm a [directors and officers] probe into First Republic is taking place,"" an FDIC spokesperson told Reuters Wednesday. The regulator did not provide additional details and has not returned Banking Dive’s request for comment. This marks No. 3 for investigations into the bank failures that cost the FDIC $32 billion this year, adding to a list that includes Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Those investigations were announced in March. The FDIC did not respond to an inquiry from Banking Dive on where those investigations stand now. First Republic’s May failure was the third domino to fall this spring, after SVB and Signature’s respective failures on March 10 and March 12. Former CEO Michael Roffler told the House Financial Services Committee in May that contagion caused his bank to fail. “Up until the cataclysmic events of March 10 … First Republic was in a strong financial position with strong investment grade ratings aligned with the nation’s largest banks,” Roffler said at the time. Eleven large U.S. banks infused First Republic with $30 billion early in the banking crisis, but it was ultimately seized by the FDIC May 1 and sold to JPMorgan Chase. The transaction was heavily criticized by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, who questioned regulators’ decision to pick JPMorgan as First Republic’s buyer. “The net result of these machinations is that, without a complete regulatory review, and at a cost of $13 billion to the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the nation’s biggest bank — already too big to fail — got a bargain deal on a failing bank that made it even bigger,” she wrote. “This is a troubling outcome, leaving me with numerous questions.” The FDIC is now investigating if First Republic executives and board members failed to act in their bank’s best interests, Reuters reported. Federal law allows the FDIC to ban former directors and officers from the banking industry if they are found to have made decisions with ""willful or continuing disregard"" for a bank’s best interests. The FDIC can also impose fines on these individuals. Roffler and former First Republic Executive Chairman James Herbert could not be reached by Reuters for comment.

This came amid stress on the financial sector sparked by a bank run in March that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a Sunnyvale institution picked up by First Citizens Bank. Stress on banks with a number of deposits above its limit of $250,000 led to the FDIC revisiting its rules. JPMorgan in early summer said it would shutter 21 First Republic locations by year-end, Reuters reported June 1. The remaining First Republic locations will be rebranded as JPMorgan. First Republic’s Mill Valley office occupied 2,847 square feet of Strawberry Village, according to space specifications posted by Edens. The Washington, D.C., retail real estate investment company purchased the 175,000-square-foot center a year ago and started renovations of the property in June of this year.

JPMorgan (JPM) Completes 14 First Republic Branch Closures - Yahoo Finance,JPMorgan (JPM) Completes 14 First Republic Branch Closures  Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 25 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qcG1vcmdhbi1qcG0tY29tcGxldGVzLTE0LWZpcnN0LTE2MDgwMDUwMS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Finance,"JPMorgan Chase JPM has shut down 14 First Republic Bank branches in California. With this, the Wall Street giant completes its initial plans to trim the failed bank’s branch network following its takeover this May.Of the total branches that have been shut, half were in San Francisco County and the rest were spread across six other counties in California.JPMorgan had initially planned to shut down 21 First Republic branches by the end of 2023. With the latest closures, the target has been met.The shutdowns represent one-quarter of the total 84 branches that First Republic operated at the end of April 2023.Earlier this year, JPM said that the 21 branches selected for closure had “relatively low transaction volumes and are generally within a short drive from another First Republic office.”While the remaining 63 branches are likely to be rebranded as Chase branches, more branch closures may take place.Jennifer Piepszak, the co-CEO of consumer and community banking, had said during JPM’s May investor day that the remaining First Republic branches will either stay open because they are in better locations than nearby Chase branches or they will be closed due to their proximity to an existing Chase office. Details of the First Republic Takeover On May 1, JPM acquired failed First Republic Bank to become an even bigger financial behemoth. JPM bought the bulk of First Republic’s $228 billion of assets and assumed deposits worth $92 billion by paying $10.6 billion. The company did not acquire any of the First Republic’s corporate debt or preferred stock.At the time of the acquisition, JPMorgan expected the transaction to generate more than $500 million of “incremental net income” annually.Also, the financial giant expected the deal to result in increased penetration within the high-net-worth clients.Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan, said, “This acquisition modestly benefits our company overall, it is accretive to shareholders, it helps further advance our wealth strategy, and it is complementary to our existing franchise.”After almost two months of efforts to save the flagging institution, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) seized First Republic in May. The nation’s biggest banks, including JPMorgan, had tried to support the San Francisco-based lender by infusing $30 billion worth of deposits (in aggregate). Despite the infusion, deposits continued to exit the company and by the end of April, there were only a few options left to save it.The failure of First Republic Bank followed the collapse of two other major banks — Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank — and led to the regional banking industry turmoil in the United States. Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank were seized by the FDIC and then sold to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. NYCB and First Citizens BancShares, Inc. FCNCA, respectively.NYCB, through its bank subsidiary, Flagstar Bank, acquired $38 billion in assets and assumed $36 billion of liabilities of Signature Bank, while not buying any digital asset banking, crypto-related assets or the fund banking business. FCNCA assumed Silicon Valley Bank’s assets worth $110 billion, deposits worth $56 billion and loans worth $72 billion. Conclusion Over the past few years, JPMorgan has undertaken several on-bolt acquisitions that have supported its fee income base and improved market share across several products and services.Also, the bank is expanding its footprint in new regions. In 2018, JPM announced plans to enter 25 new markets by opening 400 new branches. The company has made substantial progress on this front, with a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states.In addition to enhancing market share, the strategy will help the bank grab cross-selling opportunities by increasing its presence in the card and auto loan sectors.Over the past six months, shares of JPMorgan have rallied 13.4% compared with the industry’s rise of 2.7%.

The message says suspicious activity has been detected in your account; it wants you to click a link to verify your identity. You panic. You want to resolve the issue immediately, and so you click on the link and input your personal information. Next thing you know, a stranger has access to your bank account. Text-message phishing scams (also called ""smishing"") are becoming more sophisticated. Cybercriminals now have easy access to AI, which can be used to craft plausible messages from supposedly trustworthy sources such as your bank. The FBI's latest Internet Crime Report found that 298,878 complains of phishing scams in 2023 resulted in almost $19 million in loses. While fraudulent texts are dangerous scams, authentic notifications from banks can be useful for letting you know when you have a low funds in your checking account or a high credit card balance. How can you tell if a text message from your bank is real? Read on for tips to detect fake text messages and how to report phishing scams if you get hit by one. For more money tips, learn the best time to fly for cheap plane tickets and how to stop tax-related identity theft. What's the first thing to do if you get a text from ""your bank?"" First, stop to consider if you've consented to receive text messages from your bank. Melanie McGovern, director of PR and social media at Better Business Bureau, tells CNET, ""there are banks that will text, and if you've opted in, they're going to text you."" If you're not sure whether you've agreed to receive texts from your bank, log on to your bank account from its official website, and check your communications preferences via your personal profile or settings. The setting for text messages could be under ""Delivery Settings,"" ""Alerts,"" or ""Notifications."" If you haven't enabled text notifications, be suspicious: The message purportedly from your bank is almost certainly a scam, and you should report it to your bank and the FTC (see below). If you have enabled text notifications, you'll need to go further to determine whether the text message is legitimate. How can I tell if a text message from my bank is legit? If you have agreed to receive text messages from your bank, there is a list of red flags that can help determine whether a banking related text is legitimate. First, banks will never ask for personal or confidential information via text messages. If a message wants to know your PIN code, online credentials or other account information, ignore the message and report it to your bank and the Federal Trade Commission. Most banks take care to explain their policies on a security or privacy page. Bank of America says that it will ""never text, email or call you asking for personal or account information."" Banks will also not ask you to verify your identity by clicking a link. Second, watch for claims of urgency. Scam messages often try to scare people by indicating they need to act quickly to avoid disaster. McGovern says, ""they're expecting you to panic and act immediately. Especially if you see a bank name."" Third, be wary of links that are similar to your bank's official website but slightly different, such as having an extra hyphen or using the .info domain extension instead of .com. Smishing messages might also ask you to send money or make purchases -- banks will never ask you to transfer money via text message. Also watch out for messages that seem too good to be true -- your bank won't send you a prize announcement for a contest you didn't even know you entered. The educational website Banks Never Ask That (sponsored by the American Bankers Association) includes more tips for avoiding banking-related smishing scams. How should I respond to a text message that looks like it's from my bank? No matter what the message from your bank says, it's best to contact your bank directly before doing anything. McGovern says you should ""call your bank directly from the number on the back of your card or the number on their official website, not the number that texted you."" She also advises to ""never click on the link that they send."" You should always be able to reach any necessary URLs via your regular bank website. In fact, there's no need to engage with any text messages from your bank. You should be able to accomplish any necessary tasks by calling your bank or visiting its website. What should I do if I've received a text message for a banking scam? First, take a screenshot of the text message for reporting purposes and then delete the message -- you don't want to accidentally engage with it. Next, report your suspicious text message to both your bank and the FTC. If you didn't take any action on the text message, email it to your bank (see addresses below) or call them with the information. If you did interact with the text message at all, such as clicking a link or replying, be sure to call your bank's phone number for fraud or security issues ASAP. To report the phishing attempt to the FTC, simply forward the message to 7726 (SPAM). You can also report the scam using ReportFraudftc.gov. *First Republic Bank does not list an email address for reporting phishing scams on its website and has not yet replied to an email request for one Remember, there's no need to reply to or click any text messages from your bank, even when they are real. Play it safe by calling your bank or visiting its website whenever you get a text message, and you'll be sure to keep your accounts protected.

JPMorgan Chase, already the largest U.S. bank by several measures, emerged as winner of the weekend auction for First Republic. It will get all of the ailing bank's deposits and a ""substantial majority of assets,"" the New York-based bank said. The seizure of First Republic resulted in the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, when Washington Mutual imploded. Back then, it was also JPMorgan that won the failed banks' assets. Since the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, attention has focused on First Republic as the weakest link in the U.S. banking system. Like SVB, which catered to the tech startup community, First Republic was also a California-based specialty lender of sorts. It focused on serving rich coastal Americans, enticing them with low-rate mortgages in exchange for leaving cash at the bank. But that model unraveled in the wake of the SVB collapse, as First Republic clients withdrew more than $100 billion in deposits, the bank revealed in its earnings report April 24. Institutions with a high proportion of uninsured deposits found themselves vulnerable because customers feared losing savings in a bank run.

Republic First Bancorp in Philadelphia is being delisted from the Nasdaq stock market due to its failure to file a 10-K annual report for 2022 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The $6 billion-asset Republic First said in a statement Tuesday that shares would cease trading on Nasdaq and move to the OTC Pink market Wednesday while retaining the FRBK stock symbol. The OTC Markets Group is divided into three tiers with OTC Pink the least regulated. There are no filing requirements for companies that trade on the so-called Pink Sheets. Nasdaq, by contrast, requires listed companies to file annual reports within 60 to 90 days of the end of a fiscal year, depending on the proportion of shares held by public investors. Republic First cited failures by previous management teams to maintain adequate internal controls, as well as complications stemming from a systems conversion implemented in June 2022 as contributing factors in the filing delay. ""The audit process that new management and the company's external advisors had to undertake has been extensive and time consuming,"" Republic First said in the statement. While Republic First declined to provide an estimate of when it would file the 2022 annual report, the company noted it could apply to list on a major stock exchange after filing its delayed reports and meeting other filing requirements. That possibility failed to mollify investors. The stock closed down nearly 56% Tuesday at 31 cents per share. Republic First's current management team, led by CEO Thomas Geisel and Chief Financial Officer Michael Harrington, took over in December. Banking veteran Vernon Hill served as CEO from February 2021 until August 2022, when he stepped down under pressure from activist investors and a faction of Republic First's board. Regulation and compliance Regulators OK short-term accommodations for troubled CRE loans June 29, 2023 5:30 PM Republic First reported a $28 million profit for 2021 and $24.2 million for 2022, but its bottom-line results have suffered this year as different groups continued to battle for control of the company. According to its most recent Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. call report, Republic First lost $14.6 million through the first six months of 2023. Tuesday's delisting announcement comes six weeks before Republic First is scheduled to convene its 2022 annual meeting, which has been delayed by corporate and legal wrangling. A dissident investor group led by New Jersey Insurance executive George Norcross and former TD Bank CEO Greg Braca plans to seek the three contested board seats with a slate of candidates led by Braca.

It may seem a strange question to pose so shortly after the collapse of First Republic Bank, the second-largest such failure in U.S. history, but many industry experts say that its problems were unique to the once high-flying lender. Investors have also appeared to reach that view: As First Republic hurtled toward collapse, with its stock dropping precipitously, financial markets were far calmer than in mid-March, when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank provoked a panic that engulfed the industry. First Republic was seized by regulators early Monday morning and sold to JPMorgan Chase. The S&P 500 stock index barely budged in trading, and JPMorgan’s shares gained about 2 percent. The declines in many smaller banks’ shares, which were shaken by the turmoil in March, were relatively muted.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/01/multimedia/01first-republic-contagion-qjbw/01first-republic-contagion-qjbw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023-05-01,-0.573,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Positive,"- First Republic Bank, the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, collapsed due to unique problems specific to the lender.

First Republic Bank taken over by FDIC and sold to JPMorgan - NBC News,First Republic Bank taken over by FDIC and sold to JPMorgan  NBC News,"Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5ld3MvZmlyc3QtcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1mZGljLXRha2VvdmVyLXNvbGQtanAtbW9yZ2FuLXJjbmE4MTQzN9IBKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL3JjbmE4MTQzNw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,NBC News,"First Republic Bank has been taken over by federal regulators and will be sold to JPMorgan — making it the third major bank to go under in less than two months. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced simultaneously Monday morning that it had seized the bank and that JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in America, would be purchasing substantially all of the bank's assets and deposits. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department sought to reassure the markets and the public after First Republic, with $229.1 billion in total assets at the time of closure, eclipsed Silicon Valley Bank ($209 billion at the time of closure) to become the second-largest bank failure in American history. “The banking system remains sound and resilient, and Americans should feel confident in the safety of their deposits and the ability of the banking system to fulfill its essential function of providing credit to businesses and families,” the spokesperson said in a statement. The intervention comes days after First Republic reported losing about 40% of its deposits in the first quarter of the year. Amid rising interest rates and after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank this year, a growing cohort of depositors sought to move their money to banks seen as safer and offering more attractive returns. Among medium-sized banks, First Republic was most affected by the trend: As of mid-March, about 70% of its deposits were uninsured, according to Bank of America, meaning they were larger than the FDIC’s $250,000 guaranteed limit. That compares with a median of 55% uninsured deposits for medium-sized banks and the third-highest level after SVB and Signature Bank. Despite a $30 billion infusion from 11 peer banks in mid-March, First Republic couldn't stop the bleeding: Its stock fell more than 75% over the past 30 days. The scale of the San Francisco-based lender’s deposit losses were an outlier compared with other regional banks, which saw a roughly 5% decline in deposits on average this year, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Still, the rapid flight of deposits from First Republic had “created a lot of anxiety across the industry,” said Tim Coffey, managing director at Janney Montgomery Scott, a financial services group. In addition to the uninsured deposits, First Republic was also carrying many loans with fixed, long-term interest rates that have begun to lose value as the Federal Reserve has repeatedly hiked its benchmark rate. First Republic had said in a press release last week that it was seeking help to reshape its balance sheet after the massive deposit flight. On Friday night, the bank said: “We are engaged in discussions with multiple parties about our strategic options while continuing to serve our clients.” CNBC’s David Faber reported last Tuesday that First Republic had been looking to sell assets to larger banks while it raised additional equity, but it was unclear if other banks would be willing to buy. Bloomberg News also reported last Tuesday that First Republic was looking to sell up to $100 billion of loans and securities to restructure its balance sheet. The lender had already ruled out a full sale to another bank, Faber reported. By Friday afternoon, Reuters was reporting that an FDIC seizure was imminent after hopes of finding a private-sector solution fell through. Over the weekend, the government moved to take bids on First Republic, as the FDIC hoped to announce a closure of the firm alongside a purchase agreement. JPMorgan Chase was the winner. “Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement Monday morning. “Our financial strength, capabilities and business model allowed us to develop a bid to execute the transaction in a way to minimize costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund.” First Republic’s 84 branches in eight states will reopen Monday as branches of JPMorgan Chase. The FDIC estimates the cost of First Republic's receivership will be about $13 billion, less than the $20 billion it estimated as the cost from SVB's failure.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-05/230501-first-republic-bank-mn-1050-9873ec.jpg",2023-05-01,-0.034,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'David Faber', 'description': 'British schoolmaster and former politician', 'full_name': 'David Faber'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank of America', 'latitude': 37.79444122314453, 'longitude': -122.40306091308594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Faber', 'latitude': 34.16843032836914, 'longitude': -92.936279296875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Reuters', 'latitude': 50.67449951171875, 'longitude': 9.351499557495117, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Positive,"- First Republic Bank, with $229.1 billion in assets, has been seized by federal regulators and will be sold to JPMorgan Chase, making it the second-largest bank failure in American history.

JPMorgan Chase to buy most First Republic assets after bank fails - CNN,JPMorgan Chase to buy most First Republic assets after bank fails  CNN,"Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8wMS9idXNpbmVzcy9maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1wdXJjaGFzZS1obmstaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wNS8wMS9idXNpbmVzcy9maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1wdXJjaGFzZS1obmstaW50bA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"JPMorgan Chase is buying most assets of First Republic Bank after the nation’s second-largest bank failure ever, in a deal announced early Monday that protects the deposits of First Republic’s customers. JPMorgan Chase said it had acquired “the substantial majority of assets” and assumed the deposits, insured and uninsured, of First Republic from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the independent government agency that insures deposits for bank customers. “Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. He said the deal is also a good one for his bank’s shareholders, adding to its expected earnings going forward. Under the deal, the FDIC will cover 80% of any losses incurred on First Republic’s portfolio of single-family residential mortgage loans and commercial loans over the next five to seven years. JPMorgan Chase also will not assume First Republic’s corporate debt, and it will receive $50 billion in financing from the FDIC to complete the deal. Under terms disclosed by JPMorgan Chase, it will make a $10.6 billion payment to the FDIC, return $25 billion in funds that other banks deposited with First Republic in March in a lifeline negotiated with Treasury at that time, and will eliminate a $5 billion deposit it had made with First Republic. JPMorgan will record a one-time gain of $2.6 billion on its books from the deal, although it expects to spend $2 billion on restructuring through the end of 2024. Besides being good news for JPMorgan Chase and First Republic’s worried customers, it was also cheered by Treasury Department officlals, who are worried about a loss of confidence in the banking system causing damage to the US economy. “Treasury is encouraged that this institution was resolved with the least cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund, and in a manner that protected all depositors,” said a Treasury Department spokesperson. “The banking system remains sound and resilient, and Americans should feel confident in the safety of their deposits and the ability of the banking system to fulfill its essential function of providing credit to businesses and families.” The FDIC took control of the embattled First Republic and then immediately announced the sale. The failure will cost the FDIC about $13 billion. That money will be paid by the nation’s banks, which pay premiums to support the agency. It is less than the $20 billion cost of the failure in March at Silicon Valley Bank, which was a bit smaller than First Republic. The FDIC conducted an auction among several banks to see which would end up with First Republic’s assets. Those bids were submitted late Sunday afternoon, a source told CNN. Then came hours of waiting for news about which bid was successful. Health of the regional banking sector The move represents the latest effort by federal regulators to prop up consumer confidence in the US banking system, which has suffered three major bank failures in the last seven weeks. Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank both were taken over by the FDIC last month following runs on those banks by their customers. The collapse of those banks sparked weeks of speculation about the health of US regional banks, especially those with a largely uninsured deposit base. Deposits at First Republic will continue to be insured by the FDIC, and “customers do not need to change their banking relationship in order to retain their deposit insurance coverage up to applicable limits,” the agency said in its statement Monday. “As part of the transaction, First Republic Bank’s 84 offices in eight states will reopen as branches of JPMorgan Chase Bank, today during normal business hours,” it noted. First Republic, which started operations in 1985 with a single San Francisco branch, is known for catering to wealthy clients in coastal states. It had assets of $229.1 billion as of April 13. As of the end of last year, it was the nation’s 14th-largest bank, according to a ranking by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States with total global assets of nearly $4 trillion as of March 31. First Republic has branches in high-income communities such as Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Santa Monica and Napa Valley, California; in addition to San Francisco, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley. Outside of California, branches are in other high-income communities such as Palm Beach, Florida; Greenwich, Connecticut; Bellevue, Washington; and Jackson, Wyoming. It had about 7,200 employees as of the end of last year. The bank’s failure comes after its stock plunged more than 97% since the problems at Silicon Valley Bank surfaced in mid-March, worrying investors about the state of the banking sector. Attempts by some larger banks to provide a $30 billion dollar lifeline proved to be insufficient to turn things around at First Republic. Its final woes kicked off early last week when the bank reported financial results that disclosed it had lost more than half of its deposits during the first quarter, not counting the infusion of cash it received from other banks. The FDIC’s rules mean that any customers with $250,000 or less in First Republic will have those funds insured by the agency. First Republic reported last week that its uninsured deposits totaled $19.8 billion, not counting $30 billion in uninsured deposits it received from other banks as part of the attempt to keep the bank afloat. Many of the bank’s customers who withdrew money during the last month were likely above that $250,000 threshold. Uninsured deposits at the bank fell by $100 billion during the course of the first quarter, a period in which total net deposits fell by $102 billion, not including the infusion of $30 billion in deposits from other banks. The uninsured deposits stood at 68% of its total deposits as of December 31, but only accounted for 27% of its non-bank deposits as of March 31. In its most recent earnings statement, the bank said insured deposits declined moderately during the quarter and have remained stable from the end of last month through April 21. Support for the banking system The infusions of cash into First Republic came after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in mid-March. The cash came from the nation’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (CBEAX), Citigroup (C) and Truist, which worked together after the intervention by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The banks agreed to keep First Republic flush, in the hopes it would provide confidence in the nation’s battered banking system. The banks and federal regulators wanted to reduce the possibility that customers of other banks would start withdrawing their cash. But while the cash allowed First Republic to make it through several weeks relatively unscathed, its Monday quarterly financial report, which disclosed massive withdrawals by the end of March, spurred new concerns about its long-term viability. Banks never have the full amount of cash on hand to cover all deposits. They instead take in deposits and use the cash to make loans or investments, such as purchasing US Treasuries. When customers lose confidence in a bank and rush to withdraw their money all at once, in what is known as a “run on the bank,” it can cause even an otherwise profitable bank to fail. First Republic’s latest earnings report showed it was still profitable in the first quarter: Its net income was $269 million, down 33% from a year earlier. But it was the news about the loss of deposits that worried investors and, eventually, regulators. While those who had more than $250,000 in their accounts were likely wealthy individuals, most were likely businesses that often need that much cash just to cover daily operating costs. A company with 100 employees can easily need more than $250,000 just to cover a biweekly payroll. First Republic’s annual report said 63% of its total deposits were from business clients, with the rest from individuals. Over the past decade, roughly 70 banks have failed, according to FDIC data, though most of those have been smaller regional lenders. But there were no failures in either 2021 or 2022. The three failures since March 10 matches the total number of bank failures in the previous 36 months from March 2020 through February 2023. Each of the recent failures involved banks with assets of more than $100 billion. The last time there was a failure of a bank with $1 billion in assets was in May 2017, when Guaranty Bank in Milwaukee went under. And the last time there was a $100 billion bank that failed was Washington Mutual in September 2008, which had $307 billion in assets, which is still the record for a US bank failure. — CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230501075144-first-republic-bank-file-042623.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-05-01,-0.167,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Citigroup', 'description': 'American investment bank and financial services corporation', 'full_name': 'Citigroup', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/388_Greenwich_Street_from_Battery_Park_City_North_Esplanade.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Washington Mutual', 'description': 'former American bank holding company', 'full_name': 'Washington Mutual', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Washington_Mutual_Tower%2C_Seattle%2C_August_2006.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CNN', 'latitude': 51.54853820800781, 'longitude': -0.09250999987125397, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Beverly Hills', 'latitude': 34.0736198425293, 'longitude': -118.40036010742188, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Brentwood', 'latitude': 37.9268684387207, 'longitude': -121.72576904296875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Santa Monica', 'latitude': 34.01945114135742, 'longitude': -118.4911880493164, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Napa Valley', 'latitude': 38.259361267089844, 'longitude': -122.28885650634766, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Los Angeles', 'latitude': 34.05223083496094, 'longitude': -118.24368286132812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Silicon Valley', 'latitude': 37.369998931884766, 'longitude': -122.04000091552734, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Palm Beach', 'latitude': 26.70561981201172, 'longitude': -80.03643035888672, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Florida', 'latitude': 28.750539779663086, 'longitude': -82.5000991821289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Greenwich', 'latitude': 41.0264892578125, 'longitude': -73.62846374511719, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Connecticut', 'latitude': 41.66704177856445, 'longitude': -72.6664810180664, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bellevue', 'latitude': 47.61037826538086, 'longitude': -122.20068359375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 38.895111083984375, 'longitude': -77.03636932373047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Jackson', 'latitude': 32.29875946044922, 'longitude': -90.18480682373047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wyoming', 'latitude': 43.000240325927734, 'longitude': -107.50090026855469, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank of America', 'latitude': 37.79444122314453, 'longitude': -122.40306091308594, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'BAC', 'latitude': 45.63349151611328, 'longitude': 14.256560325622559, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Milwaukee', 'latitude': 43.03889846801758, 'longitude': -87.9064712524414, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"- First Republic Bank, the nation's 14th-largest bank, failed, costing the FDIC $13 billion.

What to know about the First Republic Bank collapse - Fortune,What to know about the First Republic Bank collapse  Fortune,"Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8wMS9maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1iYW5rLWNvbGxhcHNlLWtlZXAtbW9uZXktc2FmZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fortune,"Officials announced Monday that they closed San Francisco-based First Republic Bank, making it the third U.S. bank to collapse in the past two months. Most of First Republic’s assets are being acquired by JPMorgan. First Republic had wealthy clients who rarely defaulted on their loans. But the vast majority of deposits were above the $250,000 limit set by the FDIC, meaning they were uninsured. And that worried analysts and investors who were worried that if First Republic were to fail, its customers might not get all their money back. Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which catered mostly to the tech industry, both collapsed in March under similar circumstances. The First Republic deal announced Monday means customers will be able to access all of their money, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. First Republic branches will change to JPMorgan Chase branches and First Republic customers will become JPMorgan Chase customers. Here’s what you need to know: Is my money safe? Yes, if your money is in a U.S. bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and you have less than $250,000 there. If the bank fails, you’ll get your money back. Nearly all banks are FDIC insured. You can look for the FDIC logo at bank teller windows or on the entrance to your bank branch. Credit unions are insured by the National Credit Union Administration. If you have over $250,000 in individual accounts at one bank, which most people don’t, the amount over $250,000 is considered uninsured and experts recommend that you move the remainder of your money to a different financial institution, said Caleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, a financial media website. If you have multiple individual accounts at the same bank, for example a savings account and certificate of deposit, those are added together and the total is insured up to $250,000. (Read on for more about how joint accounts are protected.) Federal officials have been taking steps to make sure other banks aren’t impacted. “You shouldn’t be too concerned about your money if it’s in one of the bigger banks, and even in some of the regional banks and the credit unions,” Silver said. Are there red flags that I should look for with my bank? If you are worried about your bank closing in the near future, there are some things you can watch out for, according to Silver: — Watch the stock price. — Keep an eye on the quarterly and annual reports from your bank. — Start a Google alert for your bank in case there are news stories about it. You want to make sure you pay close attention to the way your bank is behaving, Silver said. “If they’re trying to raise money through a share offering or if they’re trying to sell more stock, they might have trouble on their balance sheet,” said Silver. Public companies, including banks, do sell shares or issue new ones for various reasons, so context matters. First Republic did so this year when the hazards it faced were well known, and it kicked off an exodus of investors and depositors. Should I look for alternatives? If you have more than $250,000 in your bank, there are a few things you can do: — Open a joint account You can protect up to $500,000 by opening a joint account with someone else, such as your spouse, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, a financial services company. “A married couple can easily protect a million dollars at the same bank by each having an individual account and together having a joint account,” McBride said. — Move to another financial institution Moving your money to other financial institutions and having up to $250,000 in each account will ensure that your money is insured by the FDIC, McBride said. — Do not withdraw cash Despite the recent uncertainty, experts don’t recommend withdrawing cash from your account. Keeping your money in financial institutions rather than in your home is safer, especially when the amount is insured. “It’s not a time to pull your money out of the bank,” Silver said. Even people with uninsured deposits usually get nearly all of their money back. “It takes time, but generally all depositors — both insured and uninsured — get their money back,” said Todd Phillips, a consultant and former attorney at the FDIC. “Uninsured depositors may have to wait some time, and may have to take haircut where they lose 10 to 15% of their savings, but it’s never zero.” How long does it take for insured money to be available if a bank fails? Historically, the FDIC says it has returned insured deposits within a few days of a bank closing. The FDIC will either provide that amount in a new account at another insured bank or issue a check. How much money can be insured in joint accounts? If you have a joint account, the FDIC covers each individual up to $250,000. You can have both joint and single accounts at the same bank and be insured for each. So if a couple each has individual accounts and a joint account where they have equal withdrawal rights, they can each have up to $250,000 insured in their single accounts and up to $250,000 in their joint accounts. That means each of them will have up to $500,000 insured. What about other investments? Customers should take a close look at the types of investments they have in their bank to know how much of their assets are insured by the FDIC. The FDIC offers an Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator, a tool to know how much of your money is insured per financial institution. FDIC deposit insurance covers: — Checking accounts — Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts — Savings accounts — Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs) — Certificates of Deposit (CDs) — Cashier’s checks — Money orders — Other official items issued by an insured bank FDIC deposit insurance doesn’t cover: — Stock investments — Bond investments — Mutual funds — Life insurance policies — Annuities — Municipal securities — Safe deposit boxes or their contents — U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, or notes — Crypto assets How does a credit union compare to a bank? Both credit unions and banks allow customers to open savings and checking accounts, among other financial products. The key difference is that credit unions are not-for-profit institutions, which tends to translate into lower fees and lower balance requirements, while banks are for-profit. Sometimes it also means that it’s easier for credit union customers to be approved for loans, McBride said. Usually, customers are allowed to join credit unions based on where they live or work. Credit unions serve a smaller number of customers, which also allows for a more personalized experience. The tradeoff is that banks tend to have larger staff, more physical branches and newer technology. When it comes to the safety of customer’s money, both banks and credit unions insure up to $250,000 per individual customer. While banks are insured by the FDIC, credit unions are insured by the NCUA. “Whether at a bank or a credit union, your money is safe. There’s no need to worry about the safety or access to your money,” McBride said.",https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AP23118532424019-e1682949714268.jpg,2023-05-01,-0.024,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Investopedia', 'description': 'website', 'full_name': 'Investopedia', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/InvestopediaLogo.png'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Mutual', 'description': 'former radio broadcasting network', 'full_name': 'Mutual Broadcasting System'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'National', 'latitude': 42.950538635253906, 'longitude': -91.28929901123047, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Union', 'latitude': 10.0408296585083, 'longitude': 124.52278137207031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Caleb', 'latitude': 33.53667068481445, 'longitude': -116.01499938964844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Silver', 'latitude': 34.534820556640625, 'longitude': -93.51019287109375, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'McBride', 'latitude': 35.51810073852539, 'longitude': -101.49405670166016, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CDs', 'latitude': 51.31583023071289, 'longitude': -0.13787999749183655, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S. Treasury', 'latitude': 33.32728958129883, 'longitude': -107.71475982666016, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Positive,"- First Republic Bank, based in San Francisco, has been closed, making it the third U.S. bank to collapse in the past two months.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) briefly took control of First Republic over the weekend, before overseeing the sale in what it describes as a ""highly competitive bidding process."" JPMorgan said in a press release it would take over First Republic's deposits and a ""substantial amount of their assets and certain liabilities."" ""Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,"" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. ""This acquisition modestly benefits our company overall, it is accretive to shareholders, it helps further advance our wealth strategy, and it is complementary to our existing franchise."" First Republic's 84 branches opened as JPMorgan Chase Bank branches on Monday, and depositors have full access to their money. Its takeover caps a rocky week for First Republic, and it marks the latest event in a a period of banking turmoil that has roiled the country's financial system. First Republic has struggled ever since the U.S. took over Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, but its death spiral began in earnest last Monday, when it announced that it had lost about $100 billion worth of deposits during the first three months of the year. Its stock tumbled so much last week that the New York Stock Exchange halted trading several dozen times. On Friday, shares closed at $3.51 — down more than 97% year to date. President Biden on Monday welcomed the takeover and sale of First Republic, saying it would ""make sure that the banking system is safe and sound,"" while he emphasized taxpayers would not be on the hook for the rescue. A death spiral First Republic is the largest U.S. lender to fail since Washington Mutual in 2008, which was also acquired by JPMorgan Chase. In March, federal regulators swept in to protect customers of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank after both lenders suffered a run on the bank, with depositors clamoring to take out their money. Citing potential risk to the broader financial system, regulators took unprecedented action to insure all deposits at the two banks — even deposits that exceeded the FDIC's $250,000 threshold for insurance. The failure of those two lenders sparked a search for other lenders that would be vulnerable to deposit outflows, and First Republic was soon identified. The San Francisco-based bank, which was founded in 1985, mostly catered to wealthy clients, offering home mortgages and commercial loans. First Republic was tossed a lifeline in March after 11 of the country's biggest banks, led by JPMorgan, deposited $30 billion in it in a bid to raise confidence. Those moves ultimately failed to convince Wall Street, and customers continued to withdraw their money. First Republic had few options left First Republic then attempted to sell itself but found few takers, eventually leaving a government-led rescue as the only available option. The FDIC asked several banks to consider placing bids, and JPMorgan, the largest lender in the country, emerged as the winner. JPMorgan's Dimon noted the bank made its bid for First Republic in a way that would ""minimize costs"" to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC estimates the takeover and sale of First Republic will cost that fund about $13 billion. For JPMorgan, the acquisition includes the ""assumption of approximately $92 billion of deposits"" held by First Republic and the acquisition of about $173 billion of its loans and around $30 billion of its securities."" Banking fears have subsided But unlike Silicon Valley Bank and Signature, whose failures had threatened to spark more bank runs, the situation is calmer now. Earnings reports from smaller lenders this month showed deposit outflows have largely stabilized. ""That fear, that mass exodus that people were concerned about just didn't happen,"" says Jared Shaw, a bank analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, who notes lenders were proactive. ""One of the things that the banks did a great job with was reaching out to their customers, explaining their balance sheets, and explaining where their liquidity comes from."" And federal regulators were keen to stress First Republic's woes were not a sign of wider problems in the banking industry. ""Americans should feel confident in the safety of their deposits and the ability of the banking system to fulfill its essential function of providing credit to businesses and families,"" according to a U.S. Treasury spokesperson. That's something Dimon echoed in comments he made to reporters after the deal was announced. ""The system is very, very sound,"" he said. Bank regulations in focus now The FDIC actions come as regulators themselves have been under scrutiny about whether they could have done more to prevent the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. On Friday, the Federal Reserve took part of the blame for Silicon Valley Bank's failure saying it should have had more aggressive supervision of the lender. The Fed also recommended adopting a tougher approach to bank regulation, including subjecting more smaller lenders to increased oversight by the Fed. Meanwhile, the FDIC issued a report Monday outlining possible changes to the country's deposit system. The FDIC report said that offering unlimited deposit insurance would likely be too costly and could encourage risky behavior by banks. But it found a targeted increase in the insurance limit for certain business accounts might offer advantages — especially if paired with other moves such as limits on rapid bank withdrawals. Any change in the deposit insurance system would require congressional authorization.",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/04/28/gettyimages-1485497904_wide-7df03be22efa6d3668b21a7f6026dbfb3b2fe605-s1400-c100.jpg,2023-05-01,-0.316,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Washington Mutual', 'description': 'former American bank holding company', 'full_name': 'Washington Mutual', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Washington_Mutual_Tower%2C_Seattle%2C_August_2006.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York Stock Exchange', 'latitude': 40.70677185058594, 'longitude': -74.0112533569336, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wall Street', 'latitude': 37.61832046508789, 'longitude': -112.16436004638672, 'location_type': 'UNDETERMINED'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dimon', 'latitude': 64.12834167480469, 'longitude': -19.906320571899414, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S. Treasury', 'latitude': 33.32728958129883, 'longitude': -107.71475982666016, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Positive,"- Regulators took over First Republic Bank and sold a substantial chunk of its assets to JPMorgan Chase, marking the third major bank failure in the U.S. in less than two months.

The only larger bank failure was Washington Mutual, which collapsed at the height of the 2008 financial crisis and was also taken over by JPMorgan. First Republic has struggled since the March collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and investors and depositors had grown increasingly worried it might not survive because of a high amount of uninsured deposits and exposure to low interest rate loans. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said early Monday that First Republic Bank’s 84 branches in eight states will reopen as branches of JPMorgan Chase Bank and depositors will have full access to all of their deposits. Regulators worked through late last week and this weekend to find a way forward before U.S. stock markets opened. They solicited bids for First Republic Bank’s assets and once again turned to JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s biggest bank, with a reputation as a dealmaker during times of crisis. Treasury officials also enlisted JPMorgan last month to spearhead a $30 billion funding package for First Republic. “Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,” said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. As of April 13, First Republic had approximately $229 billion in total assets and $104 billion in total deposits, the FDIC said. The FDIC estimated its deposit insurance fund would take a $13 billion hit from taking First Republic into receivership. Its rescue of Silicon Valley Bank cost the fund a record $20 billion. Before Silicon Valley Bank failed, First Republic had a banking franchise that was the envy of most of the industry. Its clients — mostly the rich and powerful — rarely defaulted on their loans. The bank has made much of its money making low-cost loans to the wealthy, which reportedly included Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Flush with deposits from the well-heeled, First Republic saw total assets more than double from $102 billion at the end of 2019’s first quarter, when its full-time workforce was 4,600. But the vast majority of its deposits, like those in Silicon Valley and Signature Bank, were uninsured — that is, above the $250,000 limit set by the FDIC. And that worried analysts and investors. If First Republic were to fail, its depositors might not get all their money back. Those fears were crystalized in the bank’s recent quarterly results. First Republic said customers rushed to pull out more than $100 billion in deposits following the failure of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank. Unlike bank runs throughout history, First Republic’s demise was fueled by the speed of social media and digital withdrawals that can be made in seconds from a cell phone. San Francisco-based First Republic said the $30 billion in funding it received in mid-March from a group of large banks helped it stanch the bleeding. To turn itself around, the bank planned to sell off unprofitable assets, including the low interest mortgages that it provided to wealthy clients. It also announced plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, which totaled about 7,200 employees in late 2022. Investors were skeptical, and the devastating quarterly report sent them running for the exits. First Republic shares fell 75% last week and closed Friday at $3.51. Any remaining shareholders are likely to get wiped out. The shares traded at $115 on March 8, right before Silicon Valley Bank failed. The Federal Reserve and FDIC, which regulate the banking industry along with the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, could face renewed criticism over their handling of First Republic. Both acknowledged Friday in separate reports that lax supervision had contributed to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. For Dimon and JPMorgan, there may be a sense of déjà vu: Back in 2008, Dimon was the go-to banker for Washington to find private solutions for that banking crisis and JPMorgan acquired both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. In a statement, JPMorgan portrayed the First Republic deal as beneficial both to the financial system and the company. As part of the agreement, the FDIC will share losses with JPMorgan on First Republic’s loans. JPMorgan expects the addition of First Republic to add $500 million to its net income per year, although it expects to incur $2 billion in costs integrating First Republic into its operations over the next 18 months.

The FDIC had seized control of the bank over the weekend and auctioned it off. JPMorgan won that auction, and it’s paying a cool $10.6 billion for the bank, but not without some guarantees. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the deal to rescue First Republic only modestly benefits his bank. “They are booking a $2.6 billion gain up front,” said David Chiaverini, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. “And then they are going to be generating 500 million incremental earnings annually going forward.” The bank also gets a bunch of new affluent customers, said Tiffani Montez, a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. “It’s a quick way for JPMorgan Chase to increase their market share,” she said. On the downside, restructuring will cost JPMorgan Chase about $2 billion, and the bank said it’ll also have to repay $25 billion to other banks that tried to keep First Republic afloat. So for all that, the bank got a deal sweetener. The FDIC agreed to shoulder the bulk of any losses from certain mortgages and commercial loans that would come with First Republic. “I think it was extremely important to do that,” said David George, senior bank analyst with Baird. He said many of the loans JPMorgan Chase would acquire do not offer attractive returns, and instead would be “Well below market rate.” Having the FDIC share the burden of losses makes the below market returns more palatable. Patricia McCoy, a professor of law at Boston College Law School, said there may be bigger concerns with the loans themselves. Take commercial loans, for example. “There’s a lot of talk on the street that commercial loans to finance office space in the future may go into default because there are so many office vacancies,” she said. McCoy also said a lot of the residential mortgages JPMorgan Chase would take on are interest-only mortgages, where payments suddenly jump after a few years. “Interest-only mortgages have a much higher default rate than ordinary fixed-rate mortgages,” she said. If those concerns pan out, having the FDIC shoulder some of that risk would offer substantial protection.",https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1486875390-e1682974612731.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&w=1200,2023-05-01,-0.163,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 37.12166976928711, 'longitude': -93.47138977050781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Baird', 'latitude': 32.394020080566406, 'longitude': -99.39424133300781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Boston College', 'latitude': 52.97330093383789, 'longitude': -0.015200000256299973, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'McCoy', 'latitude': 37.61867141723633, 'longitude': -86.38163757324219, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Negative,"- JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank from the FDIC for $10.6 billion, gaining affluent customers and increased market share.

First Republic Bank fails: Was it a bailout? - ABC News,First Republic Bank fails: Was it a bailout?  ABC News,"Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3MvcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1mYWlscy1iYWlsb3V0L3N0b3J5P2lkPTk4OTgzNDEz0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvQnVzaW5lc3MvcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1mYWlscy1iYWlsb3V0L3N0b3J5P2lkPTk4OTgzNDEz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,ABC News,"The collapse of First Republic Bank on Monday left it under control of the U.S. government, which quickly sold the bank to JPMorgan Chase. The move aimed to shore up the financial system after a cascade of major bank failures. JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank, retained the majority of First Republic's assets and all of its deposits, JPMorgan Chase said on Monday. In turn, the deal fully protects depositors at First Republic, who immediately became customers of JPMorgan Chase. To achieve the rescue, however, a federal agency provided $50 billion in financing to JPMorgan Chase, setting off questions about whether the government had orchestrated a bank bailout. Speaking at the White House on Monday, President Joe Biden applauded the government effort and assured that the move would not require taxpayer support. ""Regulators have taken action to facilitate the sale of First Republic Bank and ensure that all depositors are protected and the taxpayers are not on the hook,"" Biden said. ""These actions are going to make sure that the banking system is safe and sound,"" he added. Here's what to know about the rescue of First Republic and whether it's a bailout: Is the First Republic rescue a bailout? First Republic, the nation's 14th-largest bank, fell into financial turmoil because it specialized in long-term mortgage loans to affluent clients. As interest rates rose rapidly over the past year, the mortgage loans and other investments lost value, leaving the bank with losses on a sizable portion of its balance sheet. After the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month, panicked depositors withdrew a significant share of the bank's funds in part because many of the customers held deposits that exceeded the limit covered by federal insurance. If the bank had failed without a buyer, the remaining uninsured depositors may have lost their funds. JPMorgan Chase on Monday agreed to acquire all of the bank's $103.9 billion in deposits as well as the majority of its $229.1 billion in assets, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a federal agency. As part of the deal, the FDIC provided $50 billion in financing to JPMorgan Chase, the bank said on Monday. Ultimately, the final cost to the FDIC will be approximately $13 billion, the agency said. The financing from the FDIC qualifies as a bailout since it marks the transfer of funds from the U.S. government to JPMorgan Chase as a condition of the sale of First Republic, some experts told ABC News. ""The biggest fear is banking runs and lost confidence -- that is why the FDIC had to act quickly,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at broker OANDA. ""I would consider that a bailout."" ""The focus is to make sure the bank failure doesn't significantly lead to a crisis,"" he added. Anat Admati, a professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, echoed the sentiment, noting that the FDIC appears to have helped ease the acquisition of First Republic. ""This seems to be more that guaranteeing deposits, and then it becomes something that I would consider a bailout,"" Admati told ABC News. In backstopping First Republic customers, however, the FDIC ultimately carried out its mandate of guaranteeing depositors, even if by indirect means, Morris Pearl, a former managing director at asset manager BlackRock, told ABC News. ""It depends on your definition of the word 'bailout,'"" Pearl said. ""It’s kind of like if you damage your car, the insurance company might pay to repair the car or they might say this car is beyond hope and we’ll give you money to buy a new car."" JPMorgan Chase said the government chose it as a buyer because the bank's bid gave the FDIC more favorable terms than rival offers. ""Our financial strength, capabilities and business model allowed us to develop a bid to execute the transaction in a way to minimize costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund,"" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. Will the sale of First Republic cost U.S. taxpayers? The government funds required for the sale of First Republic will come out of the Deposit Insurance Fund, a pool of billions of dollars kept in case the government needs to cover insured depositors after a bank failure, the FDIC said. The Deposit Insurance Fund receives funding from banks, which pay insurance premiums in order to receive protection from the U.S. government and offer that guarantee for customers. The agency also derives income from investments made with the insurance revenue. In turn, the bailout of First Republic will not draw on individual taxpayers, since the funds do not come from taxes levied on everyday Americans. If the banking panic continues to spread, the federal government may have to take further action that draws on the Deposit Insurance Fund, potentially exhausting the fund and calling on taxpayers to supplement it with additional money. For now, however, such an outcome appears remote. At the end of last year, the Deposit Insurance Fund held $128.2 billion, according to a quarterly report.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/50f14df0-dc02-4f0b-b21a-7da03c5373bc/First-Republic-Bank-ap-ml-230501_1682953420664_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600,2023-05-01,-0.274,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'White House', 'latitude': -18.355670928955078, 'longitude': 30.927059173583984, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Biden', 'latitude': 5.229050159454346, 'longitude': -1.0081199407577515, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'ABC', 'latitude': 45.45650100708008, 'longitude': 9.185050010681152, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Stanford', 'latitude': 37.53118896484375, 'longitude': -84.6618881225586, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'BlackRock', 'latitude': 39.721771240234375, 'longitude': -76.86109161376953, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Pearl', 'latitude': 32.27458953857422, 'longitude': -90.13202667236328, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"- First Republic Bank, the nation's 14th-largest bank, collapsed on Monday due to financial turmoil caused by rising interest rates and panicked depositors withdrawing funds.

First Republic Wealth Advisors Voted With Their Feet–And It Wasn't For JPMorgan - Forbes,First Republic Wealth Advisors Voted With Their Feet–And It Wasn't For JPMorgan  Forbes,"Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3NlcmdlaWtsZWJuaWtvdi8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L2ZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLXdlYWx0aC1hZHZpc29ycy12b3RlZC13aXRoLXRoZWlyLWZlZXRhbmQtaXQtd2FzbnQtZm9yLWpwbW9yZ2FuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Forbes,"But the failure of the California bank was a home run for Morgan Stanley. Depositors and shareholders weren’t the only ones fleeing San Francisco-based First Republic Bank before it was seized by regulators and sold to JPMorgan. As a crisis of confidence enveloped regional and specialized U.S. banks, especially those with significant levels of uninsured deposits, First Republic’s wealth-management advisors also headed for the exits. More than 40% of the struggling bank’s advisors left between the end of February and May 15, data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority show. One place those departees didn’t go en masse: JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank, which on May 1 bought most of First Republic’s assets, including the wealth management operation, for $10.6 billion in a transaction arranged by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Analysts and J.P. Morgan have touted First Republic’s $290 billion in wealth management assets as a selling point for the deal. But the advisor exodus suggests the big bank may retain fewer of those assets than widely believed, since wealthy investors tend to follow advisors when they jump ship. Using Finra’s BrokerCheck service, Forbes counted up the advisors who left First Republic and registered with another firm between the end of February and May 15th. We first searched for advisors who are now, or were previously, registered with or employed by First Republic. We then manually reviewed hundreds of individual profiles and respective registration records to see when advisors had switched firms. Of the 152 we identified as leaving during the time period we targeted, 28 went to Rockefeller Capital Management (an offshoot of the wealthy family’s own investment management office) and 19 went to Royal Bank of Canada’s wealth management arm. But the big winner was Morgan Stanley, which picked up 49. Only 11 First Republic advisors had moved to JPMorgan before the deal, according to Finra filings. The bulk of the 152 departures happened before May 1, but about 40 First Republic advisors registered with new firms in the following two weeks. Since there is a lag in postings to BrokerCheck, it’s likely most of those 40 departures were in the works before the May 1 announcement of the J.P. Morgan deal. It remains to be seen how many of the First Republic advisors who haven’t left already (220, according to J.P. Morgan’s most recent estimate on May 3) will stay at the bank for the long run. JPMorgan surely realized that such an exodus was taking place and would have adjusted its bid accordingly. Still, after the acquisition, JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum said one of its benefits was “accelerating some of our key growth opportunities, particularly in wealth management.” Similarly, the purchase was considered a smart deal on Wall Street in part because First Republic’s high-net-worth client base meshed with the big bank’s ambitions to expand its own wealth-management business. Wedbush analyst David Chiaverini described First Republic as “the diamond of the season of the FDIC-assisted deals over the past two months,” because of its high-net-worth client base, the kind of operation that “is increasingly being sought after by other banks and wealth managers.” S&P Global estimated First Republic’s assets could add 11% to JPMorgan's existing wealth management operation. “Assuming JPMorgan is able to retain the bulk of FRC's [remaining] wealth advisers, we believe this should generate consistent recurring revenue,” S&P analysts wrote on May 2. In fairness, part of the reason that JPMorgan received so few of the departing brokers may be its own restraint. As First Republic’s deposits and stock price spiraled lower, JPMorgan sent out an internal memo warning executives not to actively recruit First Republic advisors. “We directed our managers to never exploit a situation of stress or uncertainty,” a JPMorgan spokesperson told Forbes. Citicorp and Bank of America issued similar cautions, according to Reuters. Morgan Stanley did not respond to repeated requests to say whether it had distributed similar instructions. But there are other reasons, too–including culture and compensation–that the brokers may have favored Morgan Stanley over the big banks. Morgan Stanley was created after Congress, in the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, required that commercial banking and investment banking be split. (One of Morgan Stanley’s founders was the grandson of JPMorgan’s founder.) While the separation of investment and commercial banking was repealed more than two decades ago, the biggest commercial banks still struggle to attract some of the richer wealth management clients. “The fact that many of these wealth advisors were with First Republic and not one of the other large banks in the first place suggests that there could be some adverse selection from JPMorgan’s perspective,” notes Eric Compton, a senior analyst at Morningstar. “Meaning, these are advisors that might be more likely to leave over time to go back to the non-mega bank set up and/or culture.” What the advisors do is critical, because an advisor that moves from one firm to another typically takes roughly 75% of their client assets with them, according to research firm Cerulli Associates. But Compton figures JPMorgan structured the deal to be profitable even without the advisors who had already departed. Just acquiring First Republic’s commercial banking business, which accounted for 82% of the bank’s more than $1.6 billion in net income last year, according to filings, would leave JPMorgan with good returns, he says. (At an investor presentation Monday, JPMorgan predicted the acquisition would raise its net interest income for 2023 by $3 billion to $84 billion.) “Any ability to keep any of the additional value of First Republic (wealth clients, wealth advisors, private bankers, etc.) would be extra optionality on top of that, which is the smart way to do it,” Compton wrote in an email exchange with Forbes, adding, “by structuring it the way they did, JPMorgan minimized those risks financially, and made sure the deal made sense under multiple scenarios.” “There will definitely be some distractions throughout the integration process and it’s pretty hard to know if most clients and advisers stick around,” an Evercore ISI analysts group led by Glenn Schorr wrote after the deal, though they added that it certainly “accelerates” JPMorgan’s U.S. wealth strategy. S everal advisors interviewed by Forbes who asked to remain anonymous predicted there will be a cultural adjustment for many of the former First Republic advisors who stay at JPMorgan. Some will certainly enjoy the stability provided by being at a bigger institution, but many others could have a hard time adjusting to the more rigid structure. One example: First Republic was able to offer loans to clients on attractive terms JPMorgan is unlikely to replicate. Another key consideration is compensation structure and what kind of payouts First Republic advisors will get. As an aggressive recruiter of wealth advisors over the last few years, First Republic offered a variety of significant bonuses to attract talent. Now, those advisors will have to adjust to a new reality at JPMorgan, which like many of the other big wirehouses, promotes a team compensation model, rather than outsized awards for the stars, insiders say. Still, the bank has made aggressive efforts to persuade First Republic advisors to stay, with CEO Jamie Dimon and other executives pitching on conference calls the company’s resources and offerings for clients. JPMorgan will almost certainly be targeting certain advisors (especially those with big client assets on their books) in its retention efforts. First Republic’s strong roster of wealthy clients in coastal cities such as San Francisco and New York is, after all, the heart of this prize. “There are many tools at JPMorgan’s disposal to manage retention risk, such as compensation and incentive structures, or things like additional autonomy within JPMorgan’s overall management structure,” notes Compton. Why did Morgan Stanley receive so many of the departing wealth managers? A spokesperson for the firm insisted they didn’t solicit any of the hires. But a source familiar with the company’s operations says that Morgan Stanley did actively recruit at least some of the advisors who signed up with it. Even if the firm’s recruitment was low key, departing advisers showed a clear preference for going to Morgan Stanley and less interest in JPMorgan. “The good news is that these advisors are going from one strong brand to another strong brand,” says Rob Sechan, CEO of NewEdge Wealth, an investment advisory firm with more than $30 billion in assets under management. He predicts most advisors and their clients will welcome the stability of a bank that is not reliant on uninsured deposits to support its assets. What’s more, he points out, many of the advisors who were on long-term contracts at First Republic are more likely to stay put now in order to get their full payouts. “Clients will certainly like JPMorgan’s stability better than First Republic, but a lot might consider other options in finding their own preferred new advisor,” says James Stack, president of Investech Research and Stack Financial Management. “If clients start leaving JPMorgan, the advisors will leave.” And vice versa, of course.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a San Francisco-based elderly couple, George Miller and Janet McKinley. For more than 25 years, the couple has donated money to UC Berkeley for the Miller Scholars Program, according to the complaint filed in the suit. First Republic Bank collapsed in May due to its having too many uninsured deposits and its failure to keep up with federal interest rates, according to the complaint. The Miller Scholars Program provides selected transfer students from low-income and first-generation college student backgrounds with up to $10,000 in scholarship money over two years. In addition to financial assistance, the program provides students with mentorship, academic research and community service opportunities. If not recovered, the loss of the $7 million will result in 700 students being unable to receive the scholarship, according to Gia Jung, one of the couple’s lawyers. The lawsuit alleged that First Republic going bankrupt and the individual actions of the couple’s financial advisor Samuel Schoner are at fault. According to the complaint, between 2017 and 2021 Schoner allegedly invested over $7 million of the couple’s money in First Republic preferred shares, most of which was designated for the Miller Scholars Program. When the bank collapsed in May, the couple’s stake in the preferred stock became worth almost zero. Leading up to the bank’s fall, the couple “repeatedly” asked Schoner to sell their First Republic stock, which he did not do, the complaint alleged. Schoner had served as the financial advisor to the couple since 2012, according to the complaint. In this role, he managed their entire investment portfolio. The lawsuit alleges that Schoner intentionally misled his elderly clients by making investments that were not in their best interest and shielding the risky nature of said investments. The couple is suing First Republic and Schoner for a breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, elder abuse and fraud. “They wanted this to be part of the legacy of giving and support for UC Berkeley and its students,” Jung said. “With the funds that Mr. Miller left, this program could have operated for another 70, 80, 90, 100 years, but unfortunately it will last as long as the remaining funds allow unless we can recover what was lost.” The couple’s lawyers requested that a jury trial be set faster than a normal case due to the 87-year-old Miller’s old age, according to Tyson Redenbarger, an attorney on the case, which will be heard in San Francisco County Superior Court. Schoner and JPMorgan Chase — which acquired a substantial majority of First Republic after its collapse — declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Small and midsize banks may opt for mergers amid industry pressures - Marketplace,Small and midsize banks may opt for mergers amid industry pressures  Marketplace,"Thu, 14 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHBsYWNlLm9yZy8yMDI0LzAzLzE0L2FjcXVpcmUtb3ItYmUtYWNxdWlyZWQtbWF5LWJlLXRoZS1uZXctcmVhbGl0eS1mb3Itc21hbGwtYW5kLW1pZHNpemUtYmFua3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Marketplace,"A year after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank, some corners of the banking system are still under pressure. Banks have to pay depositors a lot more interest than they used to, and some have troubled commercial real estate loans on their balance sheets. That means many small and midsize banks are scrambling to figure out how to survive and compete in this economy. For some, that might mean they’ll have to get bigger. There are more than 4,600 banks in this country, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. “That is substantially more financial institutions than in any other country in the world,” said David Schiff, head of retail and consumer banking at the consulting company West Monroe. Schiff said over the last year, all of those institutions have witnessed the impact of shaky commercial real estate loans and rising interest rates on deposits — they’ve made the business of banking riskier and more expensive. That “really forced a lot of banks to look at themselves, particularly smaller banks, and say, ‘Is it worth the cost of admission to continue to operate independently, or should we be looking at alternatives?’” Schiff said. The thinking is, maybe the U.S. doesn’t need 4,600 banks. Maybe they should consolidate by acquiring other banks or being acquired. “There is definitely a strong industrial logic in favor of bank mergers,” said Meg Tahyar, head of the financial institutions group at the law firm Davis Polk. She advises banks on mergers and other operations, including JPMorgan Chase when it acquired First Republic last year. Tahyar said that in general, bulking up can help smaller banks stay afloat. It makes it easier to compete against bigger ones for loan business and to improve the technology and services they offer customers. “The demands for consumers to have digital services have increased, especially since the pandemic,” Tahyar said. But even though a lot of smaller and midsize banks want to consolidate, we haven’t seen many deals in the last year. Tahyar said that’s in large part because bankers aren’t sure what regulators will do. “It is very hard, and takes a very long time, to get an approval for any kind of merger,” Tahyar said. “And there’s a very high degree of uncertainty.” Earlier this year, a senior federal bank regulator said the government is trying to make the approval process more transparent. But Jeremy Kress, assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, said even if more mergers happen this year, we shouldn’t necessarily expect the banking system to be more stable. “When a bank is having trouble, making that bank bigger is often a risky strategy,” Kress said. “What they may be doing is just kicking that financial stability problem down the road.” Kress said he’s also concerned about what will happen to borrowers — especially small businesses — if there’s a wave of bank consolidation. “Having those local relationships with locally based bankers is absolutely critical for entrepreneurs,” Kress said. “And that’s what I’d worry that we’d lose when small banks consolidate.” In other words, Kress said 4,600 banks might not be too many when you think about how many communities they serve.",https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1486875274-e1710438795609.jpg?fit=2880%2C1622&w=1200,2024-03-14,-0.05,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'David Schiff', 'description': 'composer', 'full_name': 'David Schiff'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'West Monroe', 'latitude': 41.9139289855957, 'longitude': -83.43160247802734, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Schiff', 'latitude': 51.00299072265625, 'longitude': 7.1739702224731445, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'University of Michigan', 'latitude': 42.27587127685547, 'longitude': -83.73605346679688, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ross School of Business', 'latitude': 42.272499084472656, 'longitude': -83.73750305175781, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Kress', 'latitude': 34.3650016784668, 'longitude': -101.74806213378906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"- First Republic Bank collapsed a year ago.

Alexander Kadish and Nicholas Davey, who had generated $9.2 million in annual revenue at Morgan Stanley, alleged that bank executives, including private wealth head Robert Thornton, “omitted important facts regarding the Bank’s stability and financial health” when recruiting them in late 2022 and early last year. First Republic bank executives also misrepresented the strength of its balance sheet and liquidity in regulatory filings and public statements, the brokers said. The complaint notes that executives also declined the brokers’ request to postpone their March 3 start date by two weeks, which would have allowed them to see the signs of trouble. “To date, Mr. Kadish’s and Mr. Davey’s loss of customers as a result of the Bank’s misrepresentations and omissions, as well as the damage to their reputations, has resulted in millions of dollars per year of lost income,” the complaint states. While the case could have implications for other brokers who joined First Republic shortly before its failure, Kadish and Davey will likely face an uphill battle to show that wealth executives recruiting them were aware of the parent bank’s issues, according to Brian Neville, a lawyer with Lax & Neville in New York. “There were some similar cases for the last people recruited into firms that failed or were about to be sold but I do not know of any that were successful,” said Neville, who is not involved in the case but represented several brokers in their move to First Republic. Kadish and Davey moved to Wells Fargo Advisors in May 2023, days after JPMorgan Chase acquired the failed bank’s assets in a government-arranged deal. Neither could immediately be reached for comment. A spokesperson for J.P. Morgan declined to comment. The brokers sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as receiver for First Republic Bank, and said that specific individuals will be named as defendants later. The complaint alleges First Republic executives “recklessly” touted the firm’s stability, its “robust lending platform,” referral network and attractive payout for cash balances despite knowing that these representations were false, according to the complaint. After the duo arrived, bank officials reneged on a commitment to either grant or offer competitive terms to a client seeking a $95 million loan, as well as an $18 million mortgage. Still, even as the bank came under pressure, executives assured the brokers that it would not go into receivership and that they “would be foolish to leave,” according to the complaint. “While the Bank continued to string Mr. Kadish and Mr. Davey along with their misrepresentations and omissions, competitors were able to entice Mr. Kadish and Mr. Davey’s customers to move their accounts, and tarnish Mr. Kadish’s and Mr. Davey’s reputations,” their complaint states. Their lawyer, Jeffrey K. Riffer at Elkins Kalt Weintraub Reuben Gartside in Los Angeles, did not respond to a request for comment on the case or why it was filed in court rather than arbitrations, where intra-industry disputes are typically heard.

How Citizens Financial positioned itself to scoop up private bankers from First Republic - Fortune,How Citizens Financial positioned itself to scoop up private bankers from First Republic  Fortune,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyNC8wMi8yNi9jaXRpemVucy1maW5hbmNpYWwtc2Nvb3AtdXAtcHJpdmF0ZS1iYW5rZXJzLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Fortune,"Citizens, headquartered in Providence, R.I., has $222 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, and is the 14th-largest bank in the U.S. I recently had a conversation with John F. Woods, vice chair and CFO at Citizens, for the latest edition of Fortune’s Future of Finance series. “For a number of years, one of our strategic objectives has been to be able to serve high-net-worth individuals,” he told me. “We did that a while back when we acquired a company called Clarfeld. That created capabilities to provide advice to the high-net-worth customer segments. But we had been unable to scale that platform because of the need to have enough bankers to interact with this customer segment. The opportunity arose when First Republic started to get into trouble last spring.” First Republic Bank was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation on May 1, 2023, with the FDIC appointed as receiver. “We had an opportunity to bid on acquiring First Republic,” Woods explained. “We didn’t win that bid—JPMorgan did. However, as part of that process, we became very attracted to the business model at First Republic. And a lot of the private bankers who worked at First Republic didn’t want to work at a very large bank—that’s the reason they worked at that bank in the first place.” The conversation with a handful of people accelerated to about 150 people hired as private bankers to work in California, Boston, New York, and Florida, Woods said. The bank announced earlier this month the hiring of Michael Cherny as head of wealth management advisors and Tom Metzger as head of private wealth managers. Citizens has opened its first private-banking office in Boston and has plans to open additional offices in 2024, including in Palm Beach, Fla., and in Mill Valley, Calif., in the spring. Woods expects the private bank is going to generate significant returns. “We just formally launched [the private bank] in the fourth quarter of 2023, and we have over a billion dollars of deposits already,” he told me. During our conversation, Woods also talked about how the CFO role is changing: “The evolution of the CFO role over the past decade or more involves an intensifying expectation that the CFO is a partner to the CEO and to the business unit leaders on deriving strategy.” You can read the complete Future of Finance interview here. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Leaderboard Cosmin Pitigoi was named CFO at Flywire Corp. (Nasdaq: FLYW), effective March 4. Pitigoi previously spent 20 years in finance leadership roles at PayPal and eBay, where he was most recently SVP in PayPal finance. While at eBay, Pitigoi held leadership roles across investor relations, business unit FP&A and treasury, and began his career in operational and finance roles at E-Trade and Barclays. Michael Niggemann is going to step in as interim CFO at Lufthansa Group, effective May 7, in addition to his existing duties as a board member for the division of Personnel, Logistics, and Non-Hub Business. Current CFO Remco Steenbergen is one of four executives stepping down as the airline is ""reshaping and realigning its executive board,"" as stated in the announcement. The decision comes as the airline is moving away from the COVID-19 era, according to Lufthansa. Big deal While employers often rely on colleges as a principal supplier of professional talent, college is not a guarantee of labor market success, according to a new report by Burning Glass Institute and the Strada Education Foundation. Talent Disrupted: College Graduates, Underemployment, and the Way Forward finds that one of biggest risks students face is that their degree will not provide access to a college-level job. Today, only about half of bachelor’s degree graduates secure employment in a college-level job within a year of graduation, the research finds. Among the underemployed recent college graduates, the vast majority (88%), are severely ""underemployed""—working in jobs that typically require only a high school education, or less, such as jobs in office support, retail sales, food service, and blue-collar roles in construction, transportation, and manufacturing. Just 12% are moderately underemployed, for example, working in jobs that require some education or training beyond high school but less than a bachelor's degree. The findings are based on dataset of 60 million workers in the United States, including approximately 10 million who has a terminal bachelor's degree. However, participation in internships makes a difference. There is a strong correlation between internships and college-level employment after graduation, according to the report. The odds of underemployment for graduates who had at least one internship are, on average, 48.5% lower than those who had no internships. The benefits associated with completing an internship are relatively strong across degree fields. Going deeper An updated report from the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and AICPA & CIMA finds that the largest global companies are providing more detail about their sustainability reporting, and also are obtaining a greater scope of assurance on those disclosures. The study, which is an annual benchmark now including 2022 data, also found the use of varying sustainability standards and frameworks continues to make it difficult for investors, lenders, and other stakeholders to find consistent and comparable sustainability information.

For the third quarter, Republic First reported a loss totaling $29.8 million and mark-to-market losses in its $2.6 billion securities portfolio that would far exceed its Common Equity Tier 1 capital. An investor group's decision to drop preconditions and provide Republic First Bancorp with a much-needed capital infusion may have staved off a move by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to close the Philadelphia company's bank subsidiary, Republic Bank. The investor group, led by New Jersey insurance executive George Norcross, agreed to invest $35 million Friday. Just days earlier, according to a Bloomberg report, the FDIC had sought buyers for Republic Bank. Norcross' group, which includes his brother Philip Norcross, a prominent New Jersey attorney, and Greg Braca, TD Bank's former CEO, is no stranger to the $6.3 billion-asset Republic First. They've been vying for control of the company since the start of 2022. In recent weeks, however, the group has shifted from battling management to seeking to prop it up. The group signed a letter of intent to participate in a planned $75 million capital raise in September. That agreement stated explicitly that the group's cash would come after Republic First secured $40 million from outside investors. According to the Sept. 26 letter of intent, ""the consummation of the investments by the [group] and the additional investors will occur simultaneously."" On Friday, in a press release, Republic First and the investor group stated that the remainder of the capital raise — which will seek as much as $65 million from outside investors — will commence ""upon closing of the new investment."" Additionally, Braca and Philip Norcross would join Republic First's board of directors, with Norcross serving as chairman. Four so-called ""legacy"" directors, all of whom served during the tenure of former CEO Vernon Hill, will step down. The Sept. 26 agreement permitted two legacy directors to retain seats. Neither Republic First nor the Norcross-led investor group would comment on the changes to the agreement. Pennsylvania's Department of Banking and Securities, Republic First's state regulator, declined comment. The FDIC does not comment ""on open and operating institutions,"" a spokeswoman wrote in an email. While a $35 million capital infusion would benefit Republic First, it would fall far short of solving the company's capital woes, said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Virginia-based banking consultant. Based on its Sept. 30 call report, Republic First has more than $500 million in mark-to-market losses embedded in its $2.6 billion securities portfolio — far in excess of the $301 million in Common Equity Tier 1 capital it reported. On a mark-to-market basis the bank would still be deeply insolvent, Ely said. Republic First reported $4.7 billion of deposits, but approximately $2.5 billion — or 54% — were uninsured. For the three months ending Sept. 30, Republic First reported a loss of $29.8 million. ""The numbers just jump out at you,"" Ely said. ""They're terrible numbers. ... The bottom-line question is why would anyone invest in First Republic or even buy it without FDIC assistance."" The Norcross-led group declined to comment on the call report data, as did a spokesman for the bank. Community banking Republic First to partner with activist investors in new capital raise September 28, 2023 4:28 PM Republic First has spent much of the year seeking additional capital. In March, it announced plans to raise a total of $125 million in partnership with Castle Creek, but it canceled the effort ""as a result of recent strategic initiatives and other considerations,"" according to a May 15 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For his part, George Norcross said he hoped additional capital combined with new leadership on the board would lead to a change in fortune for Republic First. ""As we said when we first announced we had taken a stake in Republic First more than 18 months ago, we believe that with proper board leadership and a focus on improving operations, the company can provide great service to its customers and depositors as well as value to its shareholders,"" Norcross said in the press release Friday. ""This investment and new leadership on the board is the next step of what will be the new Republic First.""

Former First Republic Wealth Boss Exits JPMorgan With Plans for RIA–Sources - AdvisorHub,Former First Republic Wealth Boss Exits JPMorgan With Plans for RIA–Sources  AdvisorHub,"Thu, 14 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkdmlzb3JodWIuY29tL2Zvcm1lci1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy13ZWFsdGgtYm9zcy1leGl0cy1qcG1vcmdhbi13aXRoLXBsYW5zLWZvci1yaWEtc291cmNlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,AdvisorHub,"Robert L. Thornton, the former head of First Republic Bank’s private wealth division who oversaw its dramatic growth over the past decade, is planning to launch his own firm, according to two sources familiar with his plan. Thornton, who had been with First Republic since 2004, departed JPMorgan Chase & Co., on Wednesday, almost seven months after its purchase of the failed San Francisco bank, according to the sources and registration records. Thornton’s role at JPMorgan had been unclear since it purchased First Republic’s assets out of government receivership in May and folded it into its traditional brokerage unit, J.P. Morgan Advisors, led by CEO Phil Sieg, the sources said. The timing of the exit likely coincides with the expiration of a retention agreement Thornton signed shortly after the deal, they added. It is unclear how far along Thornton, who is based in San Francisco, is with his plans for a new firm. He is expected to recruit former First Republic brokers and had garnered loyalty from many, including those who had been there for more than 10 years, two of the sources said. Thornton did not return requests for comment sent through email and social media. He spent the first 20 years of his career in investment banking and first registered as a broker in 1987 with Goldman Sachs, joined Credit Suisse five years later and then moved to Deutsche Bank in 2001. Thornton was tasked in 2010 with building out First Republic’s wealth division and grew the business over the next decade by sourcing well-heeled customers from its bank and spending big to hire big teams from its larger Wall Street rivals. First Republic’s broker roster grew to around 100 teams by 2021, up from 30 to 40 teams when Thornton took over, the executive said in a 2021 podcast. Following an exodus of dozens of advisors, the unit had around 230 brokers when JPMorgan took it over in May, although some have continued to trickle out over the past seven months. A spokesperson for JPMorgan could not immediately comment on or confirm Thornton’s departure. The firm is still in the process of officially moving former First Republic brokers and customer accounts onto the JPMorgan platform. In starting his own firm, Thornton would be throwing his hat in the ring with other former First Republic alums who have been building advisory firms. Another former wealth leader and direct report to Thornton, David S. Breslin, earlier this year opened a retail wealth business for venture capital firm General Catalyst and seeded it with a large ex-First Republic team. Other defectors this year have joined former First Republic colleagues at IEQ Capital, a private equity-backed RIA in Foster City, California that launched in 2019. Two other former First Republic luminaries who left in 2019 run another RIA, Evoke Wealth, in Los Angeles. Many of the larger teams who joined First Republic in recent years from wirehouses are still bound by the big-money deals that they took to join the bank. Those teams are required to pay back those bonuses, some of which exceeded 400% of their top producer’s annual revenue, to leave, which means they must negotiate with a hiring firm to cover the balance. Thornton will also have to find a way to convince First Republic brokers he can still provide all the resources that he had been able to deliver when attached to a larger bank, a challenge he acknowledged in the 2021 podcast. “While teams enjoy autonomy and being entrepreneurial, going independent is very challenging in certain respects because you don’t get the breadth of other wealth management services,” Thornton said on the podcast with industry recruiter Mindy Diamond. “You don’t get the brand benefit. You don’t get the banking, which is part of our secret sauce.” Clients “are not always entirely comfortable with a team on their own” in terms of “compliance, oversight and safety of assets,” Thornton added.",https://www.advisorhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Robert-Thornton-772x485-1.jpg,2023-12-14,-0.167,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase & Co.', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Thornton', 'latitude': 38.22602844238281, 'longitude': -121.42466735839844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361068725586, 'longitude': -97.82250213623047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Credit Suisse', 'latitude': 47.369598388671875, 'longitude': 8.539449691772461, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Deutsche Bank', 'latitude': 50.1138916015625, 'longitude': 8.668609619140625, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wall Street', 'latitude': 37.61832046508789, 'longitude': -112.16436004638672, 'location_type': 'UNDETERMINED'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'RIA', 'latitude': 6.533329963684082, 'longitude': 21.5, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Foster City', 'latitude': 37.55855178833008, 'longitude': -122.27108001708984, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Los Angeles', 'latitude': 34.05223083496094, 'longitude': -118.24368286132812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"- Robert L.

""We can confirm a D&O probe into First Republic is taking place,"" a spokesperson told Reuters, referring to the bank's directors and officers. The regulator did not provide further details. The investigation, which has not previously been reported, is the third the FDIC has opened into bank failures earlier this year which cost the federal government's deposit insurance fund about $32 billion. FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in March that the agency was also probing possible misconduct related to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank New York. The FDIC has not provided updates on these investigations. The three banks, which combined held more than a half trillion dollars in assets, failed following depositor runs. Regulators have said they each exhibited weak risk management and ran high levels of uninsured deposits. As with SVB and Signature Bank, the FDIC is probing whether First Republic executives and board members broke rules that require them to act in the bank's best interests. Under federal law, the FDIC can ban former directors and officers from the industry, and impose fines for breaching their fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices that involve dishonesty or ""willful or continuing disregard"" for a bank's wellbeing. Former First Republic CEO and President Michael Roffler and former executive Chairman James Herbert could not immediately be reached for comment.

First Republic Bank failed in April and was placed into the receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The FDIC then sold all of the bank's deposits and virtually all of its assets to JPMorgan Chase. Lauren Justice/Bloomberg JPMorgan Chase has closed 14 former First Republic Bank branches in California, completing its initial plans to trim the failed bank's branch network after taking over in May. The offices were closed last week, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's weekly bulletin of bank branch closings and openings. Half of the locations were in San Francisco County. The remaining ones were spread across six other counties in California. Earlier this year, JPMorgan said that it planned to close 21 First Republic branches by the end of the year. All of those closures have now been completed, according to a source familiar with the matter. The shutdowns represent one-quarter of the 84 branches that First Republic operated on April 30, when it was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and placed into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The next day, JPMorgan, which is the largest U.S. bank by asset size, acquired all of First Republic's deposits and virtually all of its $229.1 billion of assets. The deal was struck one week after First Republic disclosed that it had lost $100 billion of deposits in the weeks following the abrupt failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March. JPMorgan has said that folding in First Republic gives it access to a mostly affluent client base, and allows it to expand its wealth management business. The deal is expected to add about $500 million in earnings every year, according to JPMorgan. The 21 branches selected for closure had ""relatively low transaction volumes and are generally within a short drive from another First Republic office,"" JPMorgan said in a statement earlier this year. The 63 remaining First Republic offices will be rebranded as Chase Bank branches. But more branch closures are expected to follow. Over time, the remaining First Republic branches will either stay open because they're in better locations than nearby Chase branches, or they will be closed due to their proximity to an existing Chase office, Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of consumer and community banking, said during JPMorgan's investor day in May. Some other branches may get converted into ""private client centers,"" she said. Wealth management JPMorgan Chase gets First Republic's wealth clients. Can it keep them? May 1, 2023 4:12 PM Shortly before First Republic was taken into receivership, the San Francisco-based bank had said that it planned to cut as much as 25% of its workforce due to an extreme squeeze on profitability. Then in May, JPMorgan notified 1,000 First Republic workers that they would not be offered employment following the acquisition. First Republic was the second largest bank to fail in U.S. history, based on assets. It was one of several regional banks that drew intense scrutiny after the failures of SVB on March 10 and Signature on March 12. Both banks experienced massive deposit runs. In mid-March, JPMorgan and 10 other big banks pledged $30 billion of deposits to try to stabilize First Republic's balance sheet after the exodus of deposits. Despite the infusion, deposits continued to exit the company. By the end of April, there were few options left to save it.

Since then, JPMorgan has been trying to straighten out First Republicâ€™s tech and migrate an enormous amount of data to integrate the bank, its biggest acquisition since it bought Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns during the financial crisis. JPMorgan worked with external consultants to help integrate the systems by a late 2024 deadline, according to people familiar with the matter. Big-name consulting firm McKinsey was working on some First Republic-related projects after the acquisition, but it no longer is, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Bloomberg News The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. acknowledged in a report Friday that it could have done more to proactively address risks associated with First Republic Bank's high levels of uninsured deposits, interest rate sensitivity and rapid growth — all of which ultimately contributed to the bank's failure. ""[The FDIC's Risk Management Supervision unit] could have been more forward-looking in assessing how increasing interest rates could negatively impact the bank, given its concentration of lower-rate, longer-duration loans and dependence on low-cost funding and continual growth,"" the report said. ""RMS could have done more to effectively challenge and encourage bank management to implement strategies to mitigate interest rate risk starting in the second half of 2021 … [and] pursued a more urgent supervisory response, such as potentially downgrading the Sensitivity to Market Risk component and/or issuing [supervisory recommendations] urging management to develop strategies to mitigate interest rate risk."" Friday's report comes as the FDIC and other regulators are already taking a multitude of actions to prevent future bank failures such as proposals to raise capital requirements and revamp long-term debt and resolution-planning requirements. The San Francisco based bank's demise in May — the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history — was triggered by a surge in deposit withdrawals after customers caught wind of First Republic's declining financial health, leading JPMorgan Chase to acquire the firm in a government-brokered deal. FDIC — the primary federal supervisor of First Republic — noted that while hindsight puts into stark relief the bank's underlying vulnerabilities, the agency consistently gave bank management ""strong"" supervisory ratings and rated the bank ""satisfactory"" during the four years before the failure. FDIC further found that examination staff said that bank management was responsive to supervisory feedback and recommendations, quick to remediate findings and easy to work with. What those chummy relations obscured, however, was that First Republic's business model had a multitude of vulnerabilities. The FDIC concluded that more proactive supervisory actions — such as addressing interest rate risk or liquidity risk management — might not have prevented First Republic's failure given the magnitude and speed of deposit withdrawals. However, it emphasized that meaningful actions to mitigate interest rate risk and address funding concentrations would have made the bank less vulnerable to the contagion effects during the banking crisis this spring. A major vulnerability was the firm's heavy reliance on uninsured deposits, a concentrated and volatile source of funding. As interest rates rose, FDIC said the banks' asset-liability mismatch became apparent. ""First Republic's assets were concentrated in longer-term loans that generated low interest income, while deposits required to fund those loans were short-term. Starting in the September 2022 time frame, customers began moving from non-interest-bearing accounts to time/certificate of deposit (CD) accounts, shifting the cost structure from minimal to higher cost accounts,"" the report noted. ""This shift increased First Republic's interest expense and compressed [its] net interest margin."" Banking Crisis 2023 FDIC largely blames poor management for Signature's failure April 28, 2023 1:28 PM The bank's troubles intensified when contagion effects from the March failure of Silicon Valley Bank spread on channels like social media. First Republic's disproportionately sophisticated investors — many of whom, like SVB's customers, were based in the venture capital and tech sectors — began to withdraw their deposits, triggering a run. ""Contagion effects from SVB's failure began to spread through traditional media, social media, and short sellers to other banks with perceived similar risk characteristics,"" the report noted. ""While First Republic was initially able to manage liquidity to meet withdrawal requests, management's strategic decision to retain a long-standing business model with a significant asset/liability mismatch during a period of rising interest rates contributed to a loss of confidence in the bank on the part of depositors, and, ultimately constrained options for the bank to restructure its balance sheet by selling assets or raising capital."" As contagion effects escalated, the bank had to borrow substantial amounts of liquidity from the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Federal Reserve's discount window to balance its books. Despite efforts to slow the outflows, a substantial loss of deposits in the first quarter triggered a negative market response, a significant drop in the bank's stock price, and a resumption of substantial deposit outflows. Much of First Republic's susceptibility to contagion was attributed to its rapid growth in years leading up to its demise. The FDIC noted in its report that in the four-year window leading up to the failure, First Republic doubled in size while actual examination hours declined 11%. While the FDIC maintained that the bank was adequately supervised and staffing shortages were not broadly cited as an issue, it admitted that such rapid growth should have been monitored more closely. ""While we would not expect examination hours to parallel asset growth and while there could be explanations such as examination efficiencies on the surface, this trend appears counterintuitive and may have warranted greater explanation in annual supervisory plans,"" the FDIC report said. ""While First Republic's growth was not as aggressive as SVB or Signature Bank, which experienced annual asset growth rate of 45% and 31%, respectively, First Republic grew about twice as rapidly as its peer banks."" FDIC's post-mortem review marks the second time this year it reflected on its handling of a failed bank, following a similar report issued in April on the failure of New York-based Signature. Friday's report indicated that without the failures of SVB and Signature, First Republic might have held on, given its relatively healthy supervisory bill of health. Leading up to and especially in the wake of the failures, however, the FDIC said it could have more proactively voiced concerns.

- The bank's demise was triggered by a surge in deposit withdrawals after customers caught wind of First Republic's declining financial health, leading JPMorgan Chase to acquire the firm in a government-brokered deal.
- The FDIC concluded that more proactive supervisory actions might not have prevented First Republic's failure given the magnitude and speed of deposit withdrawals, but it emphasized that meaningful actions to mitigate interest rate risk and address funding concentrations would have made the bank less vulnerable to the contagion effects during the banking crisis this spring."

He recalls watching everything unfold at his former employer with both sadness and surprise. “When SVB went into receivership, it was a very sad day for all of us. I had spent eight years in total there. I knew a lot of people there, and just felt really, really bad,” Heshmati told TechCrunch in an interview. “Plus, SBV did a lot for the ecosystem.” But Heshmati didn’t have time to linger long on SVB’s downfall. As First Republic’s then-managing director and head of venture banking, he soon had to turn his attention to helping First Republic meet a surge in demand, a surge that began as soon as the regional banking crisis kicked off on March 10. At the time, Heshmati was at a sales conference for First Republic in San Francisco, along with executive management. “I think everybody’s phones started to get dinged almost at the same time and many of us were hearing, ‘I need new accounts at First Republic’ or ‘There’s a bit of a situation and we need a potential place to move our money,’” recounts Heshmati. “The first step in the emotional roller coaster was that we went all hands on deck.” He added: “Everybody was quickly trying to figure out how do we support this type of new account opening at scale, with this type of volume coming in…without comprising any of our compliance.” The initial reaction from some people was excitement over “so many new accounts.” But Heshmati knew better. “I remember walking through the lobby and seeing one particular person who had a smile on their face, thinking about the business opportunity that existed here. But I don’t think that person had ever spent any time at SVB or really understood the role they played in the ecosystem. And I remember looking at the person and saying, ‘This is not good.’” Indeed, it was a matter of days before First Republic itself became part of the contagion and the bank’s team went from opening new accounts to figuring out how to weather its own storm as the impact of Silicon Valley Bank’s fate began spilling over into other banks in the sector. It was an emotional roller coaster, Heshmati says. First Republic had been performing well year-over-year. Its stock was doing well. Many on the team were surprised that their bank was suddenly in trouble, too. “While SVB’s series of events happened really quickly, on the First Republic side of the house, it took a few weeks,” he said. “It was pretty difficult because there were moments where you looked at it and said, ‘We’re gonna get through this,’ and then there were moments that we didn’t know.” Ultimately, First Republic too collapsed and JPMorgan ended up buying the receivership it went into. Heshmati was soon offered a role at JPMorgan. But he declined the offer. In trying to determine his next steps, he said he spoke to more than a dozen banks. Heshmati ended up taking on a role at Citizens Bank, where he is now working to build the financial institution’s new venture banking practice from scratch. For context, Providence, Rhode Island-based Citizens has $22 billion in assets under management (AUM) and $177.7 billion in deposits. Its total assets were $223.1 billion as of June 30. “I did due diligence on the different banks, ranging from strength of balance sheet, size of the bank, commitment to the [startup] sector,” he said. “But Citizens just stood out. They checked every single box.” The bank, Heshmati said, seemed the most committed to building on what First Republic had started. “I wanted somebody else to be really, really excited about it, and never to be put in a situation where I felt like they were accommodating me,” he said. “There were really, really bullish — Citizens demonstrated that excitement right out the gate.” Heshmati joined Citizens Bank as head of emerging VC and innovation banking in July, helping create a new division there, called Citizens Private Bank, that is essentially adopting First Republic’s operating model. “Our goal is pretty simple — to be the ‘go to bank’ for the innovation sector,” he said. “Part of what I’ve learned since the events of March 10 and the downfall of SVB and First Republic is that a lot of people have gone to different platforms but they look and feel a whole lot different than perhaps what SVB and FRB represented for so many years.” He added: “We’re looking to bring that level of familiarity back as part of this next chapter.” Citizens wants to take things a step further by integrating cash management solutions into the practice. “We’re living in a post-crisis environment and banking where founders and investors are going to look at cash management differently than they did before. They’re asking, ‘Where do you keep it? How do you mitigate risk?,’” Heshmati said. “And so we’ve already put together a suite of solutions that allow companies and firms to come in and address that. We don’t want to ignore the elephant in the room. We want to offer the solutions to help give them what they need to get comfortable.” Citizens’ new practice is open for business, although Heshmati acknowledges it will take some time to ramp up. Heshmati is not the only former First Republic employee to join Citizens. Much of his team joined as well. In June, when Citizens announced the acceleration of its private banking growth strategy, it also announced 150 new hires, including teams formerly with First Republic, according to Brendan Coughlin, vice chair and head of consumer banking at Citizens. “After the disruption in March 2023, it became clear the market is more fragmented than ever, and founders and VCs are having a difficult time trying to identify the right long-term home,” he told TechCrunch via email. “With Sam and his team, we want to step in and fill the gap by creating the new ‘go to’ bank for the startup and venture ecosystem.” As part of the new division, Citizens is also opening a West Coast office. “Scale matters in new footprints, and the ability to hire a large and incredibly talented team at once was very attractive and became an obvious next step,” Coughlin added. Expanding into California has “always” been part of Citizens’ strategic plan, said Coughlin. Those plans included its acquisition of JMP Securities in November 2021. But in this case, the speed in which it moved was “opportunistic.” Similarly, Citizens has had a private equity practice for some time, where it worked with much larger funds, noted Coughlin. But with the demise of both SVB and FRB, Citizens saw opportunity in serving the startup and VC community. “VC financing plays an essential role in U.S. innovation, and with the collapse of SVB and FRB, which had generally dominated the mid-tier VC space, it left a huge void,” he said. “It’s similar to the geography piece — a venture-focused practice was always something we considered pursuing as part of our strategic roadmap…it was a natural fit for us to not only establish this practice and innovate as a company, but also bank the innovation economy and support the growth of young companies.” In addition to Citizens’ existing San Francisco office space for JMP, the bank is planning to “selectively” add points of physical presence with offices for its new private bankers, as well as customer-facing locations to connect the private equity and venture banking relationship with loan programs and wealth management for the GP/LP partner community.

"Nightingale CEO Put $12M Of CrowdStreet Investor Cash Into First Republic Stocks, Options Weeks Before It Failed - Bisnow","Nightingale CEO Put $12M Of CrowdStreet Investor Cash Into First Republic Stocks, Options Weeks Before It Failed  Bisnow","Fri, 15 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaXNub3cuY29tL25hdGlvbmFsL25ld3MvY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXRzL2VsaWUtc2Nod2FydHotaW52ZXN0ZWQtMTJtLW9mLWNyb3dkc3RyZWV0LWludmVzdG9yLWNhc2gtaW50by1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1iZWZvcmUtaXQtZmFpbGVkLTEyMDY5MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Bisnow,"Nightingale Properties CEO Elie Schwartz took more than $10M of the cash he raised on CrowdStreet that he told investors would be used to buy a massive Atlanta office complex and instead bet it on the recovery of First Republic Bank before it failed. On March 23, Schwartz diverted $12M in crowdsourced investor funds that were to be used to buy the Atlanta Financial Center and instead purchased $6M in First Republic stock and another $6M in First Republic options, Eric Lee, the chief restructuring officer for the entities Schwartz created to raise the funds, told CrowdStreet investors during a webinar Friday. The trades came on the heels of the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and as analysts were circling First Republic as another at-risk bank. First Republic shares had lost more than half their value in the two weeks before Schwartz bought the stock. On May 1, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized First Republic after a run on deposits and promptly sold it to JPMorgan Chase, wiping out shareholders in the bank. “Those shares and options became almost worthless,” Lee said on the webinar. “That money is gone, unfortunately.” That Schwartz personally gambled on First Republic with investor funds was the most shocking revelation disclosed on Friday in the ongoing fiasco of the CrowdStreet missing millions, but it wasn't the only new information investors learned on the webinar, hosted by Anna Phillips, the independent manager appointed to take over the two entities Nightingale created to raise cash on the platform. On the webinar, Lee, a forensic accountant and financial fraud expert, told investors Schwartz used $5.5M of the more than $50M in misappropriated funds on personal and business expenses, including on credit card payments and watches. Schwartz took $23M of CrowdStreet investor funds to pay dozens of separate third parties, Lee told the investors. Those payments range from small amounts to a $9.4M transaction. The entities weren't identified on the call, and Lee said it was unknown how much of these funds could be clawed back, especially given the expense of litigation. “You don’t want to spend a lot of money in litigation to get these little funds,” he said. CrowdStreet did not return messages seeking comment as of press time. The saga began last year when Nightingale launched two crowdfunding campaigns on CrowdStreet, first raising $45M from retail investors to buy the 915K SF Atlanta Financial Center complex from Sumitomo Corporation of America for $182M, a price that would have represented a $78M loss. Months later, Nightingale returned to the platform to raise equity to renovate a Miami Beach office building it already owned. It raised $8.8M toward that effort. More than 600 investors participated in the campaigns at a minimum commitment of $25K each, but neither deal closed. In June, CrowdStreet told investors it couldn't account for where the funds were located — they had gone directly into LLCs controlled by Schwartz rather than being placed in escrow — and accused Nightingale of misappropriating the funds. Phillips was appointed as an independent manager to take control of the LLCs and pushed both entities into bankruptcy with the intent of recovering as much of the missing millions as possible. Nightingale has run into trouble at several of its other investments. Before the Atlanta Financial Center campaign, it bought 200 West Jackson St., a Chicago office building, for $130M, funded in part by $25M of equity from CrowdStreet investors. CrowdStreet is also seeking to have Phillips take over that property, telling investors in July that the company was ""concerned that Nightingale may have acted inappropriately in managing the 200 West Jackson property as well."" The New York-based firm has a long track record of acquiring large office buildings, having made more than $10B in investments over the years. But across the country, its portfolio is struggling. It lost control of the largest office property in Philadelphia earlier this year, lost a Brooklyn office building to foreclosure and is battling foreclosure at multiple Manhattan buildings. Nightingale's alleged fraud has rocked the real estate crowdfunding industry, prompting a handful of CrowdStreet's competitors to issue statements to their customers assuring them that their investments were safe while admitting that the decade-old industry had taken a reputational hit. “Financial services and fraud are unfortunately a natural pairing, and given that our industry is still newer and on a growth curve, anything that could hurt the reputation could hurt its growth,” EquityMultiple CEO Charles Clinton told Bisnow last month. Phillips said on the webinar that her team had reached a settlement with Nightingale on behalf of the two bankrupt entities. The advanced settlement talks were first disclosed earlier this month during a bankruptcy court status update. “We have reached a settlement in principle with Mr. Schwartz and Nightingale,” she said. “There is a substantial transaction that hopefully will occur that will also benefit the investors. This could be a very good result for our investors."" Phillips didn't reveal details of the potential settlement Friday, except that it would be the basis of a plan for both entities to exit bankruptcy. Phillips said the investors could be told about the details of the settlement as soon as Thursday. The deal would still be subject to an investor vote and court approval. Phillips also told investors that she continues to cooperate with the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as Bisnow previously reported. She added the FBI to the list of agencies she said were investigating Schwartz and Nightingale but said those conversations were independent of her pursuit of a settlement. “My job is getting your money back, not putting this guy in jail,” she told investors.

It was then that Bob Thornton, the president of the wealth management unit, was tasked with shaking things up and transforming First Republic into a major player. Related: Mindy Diamond on Independence: A Rare Glimpse into the Culture, Cachet and Success of First Republic And that he did. The momentum started with two mega acquisitions that put First Republic on the map—$6B Luminous Capital and $6.1B Constellation Wealth Advisors. Those deals led to many big recruiting wins over the years, with the unit eclipsing $270 billion in assets, according to their 2022 filings. The wealth management unit that Bob helped build had the ingredients of success: a boutique culture, a strong referral mechanism, and the perfect blend of freedom and infrastructure. However, it could not withstand the regional banking crisis of 2023: First Republic Bank’s bottom fell out along with the foundation it provided for the wealth unit, leaving behind stress and uncertainty for the unit’s elite advisors.

In this episode, Bob and special guest Melanie Whelan, managing director at Summit Partners, speak candidly with Mindy Diamond. They discuss: The reality of what happened to the wealth management unit at First Republic—and what Bob learned from that experience. Bob’s vision for the new firm—and why he feels top advisors will be attracted to it. The value that Summit Partners sees in this venture—and how Bob’s expertise in creating the “secret sauce” that attracted top advisors to First Republic was an attractive proposition to the PE firm. The role that Summit Partners will play in this partnership—and the growing trend of private equity in the RIA space. Plus, Melanie talks about how her experience as both COO and CEO roles at SoulCycle is shaping the process of building and growing the new wealth management business from the ground up. It’s rare, behind-the-scenes access to the creation of a new firm—that, as of this recording, the name of which has yet to be revealed.

The 1.02 trillion Swedish kronor ($114 billion) pension fund said Dec. 5 that it will lead the class action against First Republic ""with the goal of getting back as much as possible of the capital that investors lost,"" according to a translation of a news release. Alecta's 9.7 billion kronor holding in First Republic Bank was sold at a loss in March for 7.3 billion kronor. ""We have a duty to take the legal measures we can to get back as much of the capital as possible after First Republic's collapse,"" said CEO Peder Hasslev in the translation of the release. Alecta said by taking an active role in the U.S. court it is working to maximize the capital it can recover for itself and other participants in the class action. How much it can recover is ""difficult to assess,"" adding that it normally takes years before a final ruling is made. The Stockholm-based pension fund requested lead plaintiff status. U.S. District Judge James Donato is overseeing the case, being heard in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The pension fund also is passively participating in class actions against Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. Alecta had a total 12 billion kronor invested in the two banks; that was written down to zero. The investments led to an investigation by the board and the Swedish watchdog Finansinspektionen That resulted in several job casualties among staff including CEO Magnus Billing, who left in April. Alecta is also being scrutinized over its holding in real estate firm Heimstaden Bostad and whether rules were broken in its investment. Sweden's National Prosecutor's Office launched a preliminary investigation into suspected corruption offenses related to the investment in November.

Leader Bank Hires from First Republic to Build Startup Banking Unit - Banker & Tradesman,Leader Bank Hires from First Republic to Build Startup Banking Unit  Banker & Tradesman,"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYmFua2VyYW5kdHJhZGVzbWFuLmNvbS9sZWFkZXItYmFuay1oaXJlcy1mcm9tLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLXRvLWJ1aWxkLXN0YXJ0dXAtYmFua2luZy11bml0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Banker & Tradesman,"Arlington-based Leader Bank has become the second Boston-area community bank to intentionally pursue clients in the region’s tech economy with the hiring of eight-year First Republic Bank veteran Vitaliy Schafer. “This is something we’ve been wanting to do for about five years, but we weren’t really able to find a way to properly wedge into it because [Silicon Valley Bank] and First Republic had a lock on the market,” Leader Bank President Jay Tuli said. “We’ve taken our time to bring the right person in.” At First Republic, Schafer was a Boston-based managing director serving clients in the local tech sector and the private equity, venture capital and hedge fund companies that funded it. When the successive collapses of SVB and First Republic sent startups and venture capital firms running to diversify where they kept their deposits, Leader found an opportunity to finally get in on the region’s booming tech sector. “We’ve fallen into it a little bit, more by accident. Especially when the SVB and First Republic stuff happened, a number of of clients came over, referred by our contacts,” Tuli said. “The majority were Massachusetts-based, and a lot of them were smaller VC funds, themselves.” Leader plans to build on this foundation with a familiar playbook that SVB, First Republic and their local rival Cambridge Trust have successfully used: develop banking and lending products and a knowledge base that startups and venture capital firms need, and start hosting events to connect startup executives to investors, other founders and potential employees. “What startups need is a lot of connections, and this is where the relationship [with the bank] is really important,” Tuli said. “They need connections to potential investors, perfecting their pitch. They need some hand-holding as they build their business.” While many startups don’t need debt early in their life cycle, Tuli said the relationships Leader hopes to build with startups can grow from simple depositors as those startups grow over the long term. Leader hopes its relatively small size – $4.02 billion in assets, $3.43 billion in deposits – can help it stand out when compared to the two biggest banks serving the local tech sector: SVB owner First Citizens Bank and JPMorgan Chase, which absorbed First Republic. “We think there’s an opening here for a smaller and more nimble bank to come in,” Tuli said. “SVB was already big and now they’re part of a much bigger bank. In a way they can serve the much bigger clients better and it makes it harder for them to serve the smaller clients. It’s also about the team members, the employees. They don’t all want to work for such a large organization. The appeal for them was the entrepreneurial nature, the smaller size of the banks they worked for.” At Leader, Schafer’s title will be “director of venture capital, private equity and technology banking,” and Tuli said the bank is looking to “opportunistically” hire additional staff for Schafer’s team as it finds them. The bank hopes to grow its technology banking unit to $500 million in deposits in the next five years, Tuli said. While recession worries, the spring’s bank failures and higher interest rates have caused some investors to redirect funds to less risky investments and away from startups, Tuli said that he believes the bank is at an ideal time to get into the tech space and take advantage of any growing thaw in the tech sector’s capital markets.",https://bankerandtradesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/leader-bank-file-1024x771.jpg,2023-09-06,0.071,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Arlington', 'latitude': 42.41537094116211, 'longitude': -71.15644073486328, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Boston', 'latitude': 42.358428955078125, 'longitude': -71.05976867675781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361068725586, 'longitude': -97.82250213623047, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Schafer', 'latitude': 50.410301208496094, 'longitude': 8.035409927368164, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Leader', 'latitude': 36.62894821166992, 'longitude': -91.77375793457031, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Tuli', 'latitude': 42.649959564208984, 'longitude': 18.37748908996582, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Massachusetts', 'latitude': 42.36565017700195, 'longitude': -71.10832214355469, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cambridge', 'latitude': 42.375099182128906, 'longitude': -71.1056137084961, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'First Citizens Bank', 'latitude': 35.728641510009766, 'longitude': -78.63935852050781, 'location_type': 'POI'}]",Positive,"- Vitaliy Schafer, an eight-year veteran of First Republic Bank, has been hired by Leader Bank to pursue clients in the Boston-area tech economy.

Those closures came sooner than an initial year-end estimate provided in June. JPMorgan Chase entered into a deal to purchase the failed bank on May 1 after it was seized by regulators, capping a steep decline for the San Francisco-based lender, which became the largest bank to close since the Great Financial Crisis. From its 1985 founding, it grew to become the third-largest bank in the Bay Area and the 14th-largest in the country at the end of last year. It catered to high-net-worth individuals, with roughly 40% of its deposits originating in the Bay Area, and was known for attractive mortgage rates and high-touch customer service, gaining a base of loyal customers and longtime employees. As part of that acquisition, JPMorgan announced plans to shut down 21 First Republic locations across eight states—roughly a quarter of the bank’s branches—Reuters reported. “These locations have relatively low transaction volumes and are generally within a short drive from another First Republic office,” a JPMorgan spokesperson said in a statement. “Clients should expect to continue to receive the same level of service with seamless access to their money.” A major lender and employer in the Bay Area, First Republic was considered a cornerstone of the region's real estate sector.

It's a wrap for First Republic after nearly four decades. AFP via Getty Images Key Facts January 13: First Republic delivers seemingly strong financial results from the last quarter of 2022, topping analysts’ earnings estimates, but the company reveals its interest expenses surged some 2,040% year-over-year and 153% from the prior quarter, in what turned out to largely be the death knell for the bank as it failed to navigate the Federal Reserve’s 2022-23 interest rate hike campaign. March 8: Fellow California bank Silvergate Capital announces it will cease operations as it failed to recover from solvency challenges spurred by its dealings with cryptocurrency flameouts such as FTX, while Silicon Valley Bank stokes panic among customers after it revealed the sale of $2 billion in debt securities at a loss to shore up liquidity. March 10: Financial regulators close Silicon Valley Bank in a stunning mid-day move as the bank proved incapable of meeting withdrawal requests; shares of First Republic slide 29% between March 8 and March 10 as investors look to minimize exposure to arguably Silicon Valley Bank’s closest peer. March 12: The crypto-happy, New York-based Signature Bank fails, while federal regulators announce they will guarantee depositors above the $250,000 limit at Signature and Silicon Valley Banks—the second and third-biggest banks to ever fail in the U.S. at the time. March 16: After shares of First Republic fall a further 62% from March 10 as the bank’s leadership failed to calm investors about its outlook, a consortium of the 11 largest American banks injected First Republic with a total of $30 billion in uninsured deposits in a government-backed move. March 19-20: Bank failures go abroad as the Swiss government orchestrates UBS’ takeover of its ailing rival Credit Suisse on March 19, while the rescue efforts for First Republic gain little traction as its stock cratered nearly 50% to an all-time low March 20. April 24: Following a fairly quiet month for First Republic (its share prices actually rose nearly 25%), the bank delivers a downright dreadful earnings report, disclosing it suffered a 41% outflow in deposits during the first quarter of 2023, sparking reports about the Biden Administration scrambling to find a solution for the bank and its stock sliding all the way down to $8, nearly 95% below its early March share price. May 1: First Republic is officially no longer after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announces the closure of the bank and the sale of most of its deposits and assets to JPMorgan Chase; JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon confirms to analysts his firm won’t retain First Republic name and branding, writing the final chapter in the coffin for the bank’s 38-year history. Key Background The target federal funds rate, which sets the cost of borrowing between banks and is determined by the Fed, sits at 4.75% to 5%, a nearly 20-year high and up from near 0% in March 2022. Higher interest rates make banks’ cost of doing business much steeper, and the failures of First Republic, Silicon Valley and Signature Banks can largely be traced to their ill-preparedness for changes to rates. “The balance sheets of the three failed banks shared a vulnerability to rising rates that exceeds that of most other regional banks,” Wells Fargo strategist Paul Christopher explained in a Monday note to clients. Surprising Fact Though this year’s three bank failures fall far short of the several dozen failing every year between 2008 and 2013, 2023 is by far the most costly year ever for bank failures measured by the shuttered institution’s assets, according to LPL Financial research.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) By KEN SWEET Published [hour]:[minute] [AMPM] [timezone], [monthFull] [day], [year] Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print NEW YORK (AP) — Depositors at First Republic Bank pulled more than $100 billion out of the bank during last month’s crisis, as fears swirled that it could be the third bank to fail after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. San Francisco-based First Republic said Monday that it was only able to staunch the bleeding after a group of large banks stepped in to save it by depositing $30 billion in uninsured deposits. It said it now plans to sell off assets and restructure its balance sheet, and lay off as much as a quarter of its workforce, which totaled about 7,200 employees at the end of 2022. Its stock tumbled more than 20% in after-hours trading Monday. First Republic reported first-quarter results Monday that showed it had $173.5 billion in deposits before Silicon Valley Bank failed on March 9. On April 21, it had deposits of $102.7 billion, including the $30 billion the big banks deposited. It said since late March, its deposits have been relatively stable. “We continue to take steps to strengthen our business,” Jim Herbert, the bank’s executive chairman and Mike Roffler, the bank’s CEO, said in a joint statement. Bank executives did not take questions from industry analysts during a call Monday about the quarterly results.

Its clients, mostly the rich and powerful, rarely defaulted on their loans. The bank made much of its money making low-cost loans to the rich, which reportedly included Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Even through the crisis triggered by the collapse of the two banks, First Republic’s book of loans more than 90 days past due was zero. But its franchise became a liability when bank customers and analysts noted that the vast majority of First Republic’s deposits, like those in Silicon Valley and Signature Bank, were uninsured — that is, above the $250,000 limit set by the FDIC — which meant that if First Republic were to fail, its depositors would be at risk of not getting all their money back. The bank said its profits fell 33% in the three-month period that ended March 31 from a year earlier, and revenues were down 13%.

"JPMorgan is cutting about 1,000 First Republic Bank employees - CNN","JPMorgan is cutting about 1,000 First Republic Bank employees  CNN","Thu, 25 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yNS9idXNpbmVzcy9qcG1vcmdhbi1jaGFzZS1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1iYW5rLWVtcGxveWVlcy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFYaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wNS8yNS9idXNpbmVzcy9qcG1vcmdhbi1jaGFzZS1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1iYW5rLWVtcGxveWVlcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"JPMorgan Chase informed about 1,000 First Republic Bank employees on Thursday that they will no longer have jobs. JPMorgan acquired most of First Republic’s assets earlier this month after the San Francisco-based regional bank was seized by the government. It marked the second-biggest bank failure in US history. A JPMorgan spokesperson told CNN that the bank updated all First Republic employees on Thursday about their future employment status and the vast majority — or nearly 85% — have been offered a transitional or full-time role. That leaves 15%, or about 1,000, First Republic employees who are not receiving an employment offer. News of the job impact was previously reported by the Financial Times. JPMorgan said the company’s May 1 deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to buy most of First Republic did not include all of the company’s employees. “We’ve been transparent with their employees and kept our promise to update them on their employment status within 30 days,” JPMorgan said in a statement. “We recognize that they have been under stress and uncertainty since March and hope that today will bring clarity and closure.” The bank said that employees who have not been offered a role will receive pay and benefits covering 60 days and will be offered a package that includes an additional lump sum as well as continuing benefits coverage and resources to find new opportunities. It’s not clear how many First Republic employees that have been offered employment at JPMorgan will have full-time versus transitional roles. The transitional roles being offered to some First Republic employees will last for a period of between three and 12 months, JPMorgan said. After regulators shut First Republic down, JPMorgan won a competitive bidding process run by the FDIC. JPMorgan agreed to make a $10.6 billion payment to the corporation. Some progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have been critical of the First Republic deal because it allowed America’s biggest bank to get even bigger.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230525195841-jpmorgan-chase-052023.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-05-26,-0.096,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'CNN', 'latitude': 51.54853820800781, 'longitude': -0.09250999987125397, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Mass', 'latitude': 10.008580207824707, 'longitude': 139.72137451171875, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Negative,"- JPMorgan Chase acquired most of First Republic Bank's assets after the San Francisco-based regional bank was seized by the government, marking the second-biggest bank failure in US history.

First Republic Bank collapse is a reminder why we need reform - PIRG,First Republic Bank collapse is a reminder why we need reform  PIRG,"Thu, 11 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcGlyZy5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZmlyc3QtcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1jb2xsYXBzZS1pcy1hLXJlbWluZGVyLXdoeS13ZS1uZWVkLXJlZm9ybS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,PIRG,"The recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the second-largest bank failure ever. Then, on May 1, regulators seized and sold First Republic Bank. Why are these banks failing right now? Here’s one reason: In 2018, the Trump administration and Congress weakened critical regulations that were meant to prevent these kinds of collapses. Bank failures are dangerous and costly. In addition to putting the finances of depositors at risk, these failures have ripple effects across the entire economy. Already, it’s becoming harder for consumers and businesses to obtain loans, it seems likely that other small and midsize banks could be at risk in the near future. But our elected officials have a chance to restore some much-needed safeguards that would help prevent more bank collapses from happening. That’s why we’re Congress to pass the Secure Viable Banking Act, which would restore depositor protections and protect against bank failures. Weak bank safety standards are leading to costly failures The SVB failure also led to the failure of Signature Bank in New York. First Republic Bank, headquartered in California, also experienced a bank run and had to receive a bailout — before ultimately folding entirely. All three banks had one thing in common: They had assets between $50 billion and $250 billion. That range is significant because, during the Trump administration, Congress passed a law rolling back regulations for banks of this size. The rollbacks raised the threshold for when and which banks are required to undergo stress tests or submit so-called “living wills” — both safety valves designed to avoid financial disaster. (These safeguards were first codified in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which PIRG helped pass in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. We opposed reversing them five years ago, and are hopeful this Congress will bring them back.) The Secure Viable Banking Act will help protect consumers Enter the Secure Viable Banking Act, introduced by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), U.S. Rep. Katie Porter (Calif.) and others.

The bank suffered from a run on deposits just weeks after the collapse of two other large regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. All of them had large amounts of uninsured deposits. What Was First Republic Bank? First Republic Bank was a San Francisco-based regional bank focused on high-net-worth clients. It closed in 2023 and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase. Part of the reason why it failed was because a large proportion of its deposits exceeded the limit for coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). The FDIC covers up to $250,000 per account holder, per account type. So, if a bank fails, depositors’ funds are protected for up to that amount. But anything over that is generally not considered covered. As of December 2022, 67.4% of First Republic’s deposits were uninsured, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data analysis. Following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, many First Republic customers with uninsured funds became concerned about holding their money at a regional bank, which led to a run on deposits. Just before its collapse, First Republic had $103.9 billion in deposits and $229.1 billion in assets. JPMorgan Chase acquired the majority of its assets and rebranded 84 branches in eight states, opening them on May 1, 2023. As a result, First Republic’s customers had uninterrupted service, and their funds—even their uninsured deposits—were safe. First Republic’s demise marked the third bank failure in 2023, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according to the Federal Reserve’s failed-bank list. In total, the three banks had a combined $548.5 billion in assets, which was more than the total assets for all the failed banks in 2008, the height of the financial crisis. Each First Republic client had a “First Republic Relationship Manager” who served as a point of contact for personalized service. Services focused on private banking and private wealth management as well as private business banking. Private banking and private wealth management: Services included mortgage and personal lending and accounts for checking, savings, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Private wealth management provided investment management, financial planning, foreign exchange, trust administration and custody, and brokerage and insurance services.Private business banking: Personalized business banking and lending services focused on industries like venture capital, private equity funds, hedge funds and firms, and investment management firms. Other target industries included property management and real estate investors, private clubs, independent schools, medical practices, and wineries. History of First Republic Bank First Republic Bank was founded in 1985 by James H. Herbert II to focus on jumbo mortgages, CDs, and savings accounts. The bank operated in San Francisco, specializing in lending for luxury homes, second homes, condos and co-ops, and investment properties. In the late 1990s, First Republic expanded into a full-service bank and added new services and markets on the West Coast and East Coast. Over the following decades, First Republic built its reputation on having fewer customer accounts with more individualized service and continued to focus on high-net-wealth clients. In 2007, First Republic merged with Merrill Lynch, which in turn was acquired by Bank of America in 2008. In 2010, Herbert raised private equity capital and secured regulatory approval to buy back First Republic. Why Did First Republic Bank Fail? First Republic Bank failed for many of the same reasons that Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank failed, including the fact that it carried a significant amount of uninsured deposits and struggled with liquidity. Like SVB, it focused part of its business on startups in Silicon Valley that held balances much higher than $250,000, according to news reports. Compounding this was the broader fear among investors over regional banks. Uninsured deposits: A high number of uninsured deposits can contribute to a bank run when investors start to panic. First Republic’s wealthy customer base had a high proportion of uninsured deposits, with more than 67% of the bank’s deposits being uninsured as of December 2022. Lack of liquidity: First Republic’s primary income source was net interest income from loans and investment securities. Many of its investments were in real estate loans and municipal securities, which were less liquid and not earning competitive interest rates. Among midsize banks, First Republic had the highest ratio of loans and securities to uninsured deposits in December 2022. Credit ratings downgrades: First Republic Bank faced repeated credit agency downgrades due to concerns that infusions wouldn’t resolve its challenges with liquidity, funding, and profitability. Mistrust in regional banks: Due to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier in the year, along with credit ratings downgrades, investors were increasingly concerned about keeping uninsured deposits with a regional bank. First Republic began borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLB) and Federal Reserve and accepted a $30 billion cash infusion from a consortium of 11 banks as its deposits started rapidly declining after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Meanwhile, its share price plunged from $122.50 on March 1, 2023, to $3.51 on April 28, 2023. Timeline of the 2023 Collapse 2022 Dec. 31: First Republic met all capital ratio requirements to be “well-capitalized.” However, the bank had already borrowed $14 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLB). 2023 Feb. 28: First Republic’s annual report outlined its challenges, including the fact that most of its loan portfolio was secured by real estate and concentrated in California and the San Francisco Bay Area. The report noted that the bank “experienced rapid migration of deposits to higher yielding products and asset classes” due to rising interest rates. March 6: FRB’s stock fell more than 75% within days and never recovered. March 10: Silicon Valley Bank was closed by the FDIC, and First Republic began experiencing what it called “unprecedented deposit outflows.” March 12: The FDIC closed Signature Bank. March 15–19: Numerous credit rating agencies downgraded First Republic’s credit rating, signaling a lack of confidence in the bank. March 16: To boost First Republic’s liquidity, 11 banks contributed $30 billion in uninsured deposits. March 31: First Republic Bank had borrowed $105.4 billion from Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLB) funding. April 24: The bank indicated it was headed toward collapse as deposits declined almost 41% from December 2022. It announced plans to reduce its workforce by up to 25%, among other cost-cutting steps. April 28: First Republic could not access more funding after $121.3 billion in outstanding borrowings from the Federal Reserve and FHLB funds. News outlets reported that the FDIC planned to find buyers for First Republic. May 1: JPMorgan Chase acquired a substantial majority of First Republic Bank’s assets. Impact on Depositors and Investors First Republic customers had uninterrupted service and their money was ultimately safe after the acquisition by JPMorgan Chase. As of May 5, 2023, the plan was to transition First Republic’s platforms and operations to JPMorgan Chase’s technology over time. Some existing First Republic branches were expected to be converted into J.P. Morgan wealth centers, and the bank’s private wealth management platform was slated to be merged with J.P. Morgan Advisors. Why Do Banks Keep Failing? Several common contributing factors led to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank (as well as Silvergate Capital) in early 2023. These include the banks’ high proportion of uninsured deposits and a focus on overly niche markets, such as venture capitalists in the case of SVB and commercial real estate in the case of Signature Bank. Following the collapse of SVB, investors were more motivated to move their uninsured deposits out of regional banks to protect their funds. The banks were also struggling with asset issues. During the COVID-19 pandemic, historically low interest rates led to banks amassing larger commercial and real estate lending portfolios. As interest rates rose in 2022, lending slowed, and banks were stuck with low-rate loans while paying higher interest rates to customers. The Bottom Line First Republic Bank was among a few regional banks that failed in early 2023 due to bank runs driven in part by the high volume of uninsured deposits that they carried, along with financial struggles caused by the broader interest rate environment. To ensure your funds are safe, consider keeping an amount under the minimum FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 in your bank account. If you need to deposit more than that, you could open another account at a different bank.

First Republic: What happens to deposits and shareholders now? - CBS News,First Republic: What happens to deposits and shareholders now?  CBS News,"Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZmlyc3QtcmVwdWJsaWMtYmFuay1zdG9jay1kZXBvc2l0cy1zaGFyZWhvbGRlcnMtY2JzLWV4cGxhaW5zL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2ZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLWJhbmstc3RvY2stZGVwb3NpdHMtc2hhcmVob2xkZXJzLWNicy1leHBsYWlucy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CBS News,"First Republic Bank was teetering for weeks before it was seized early Monday by regulators, who then accepted a bid from banking giant JPMorgan Chase to acquire almost all of its assets. That move is leading to a host of questions about what happens next, such as the sale's impact on depositors and shareholders. Here's what to know about the bank's collapse.Why did First Republic Bank collapse?The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation took over First Republic early Monday because the regulator had determined that the bank was conducting its business in an ""unsound manner."" The California regulator then appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the bank's receiver.The collapse follows the March seizure by regulators of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, both of which had experienced bank runs. Like Silicon Valley Bank, a significant share of First Republic's deposits were uninsured because they exceeded the $250,000 insurance protection that is offered by the FDIC. Such banks are more vulnerable to bank runs because nervous depositors are prone to withdraw their assets at the first sign of trouble.Regulators assumed control of First Republic one week after the bank's executives revealed that customers had withdrawn more than $100 billion during a panic last month. Why are banks failing?Silicon Valley, Signature Bank and First Republic failed partly due to their unusual reliance on wealthy individuals and companies, including unprofitable startups, combined with the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes.Those higher rates have made it more expensive for startups and other businesses to borrow money, which meant many of them were burning through their cash deposits and withdrawing money at faster rates. When Silicon Valley Bank sought to shore up its balance sheet by selling bonds — at a loss — it spooked depositors, who then withdrew even more funds. Depositors at other banks soon followed, leading to large withdrawals at other midsize banks that were forced to borrow from federal programs to shore up their balance sheets. None were hit as hard as First Republic, however.Didn't big banks already pour money into First Republic?Yes, a group of large banks provided $30 billion in funding in mid-March to help stabilize First Republic in the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank failure. To turn itself around, the bank planned to sell off unprofitable assets, including the low-interest mortgages that it provided to wealthy clients. It also announced plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, which totaled about 7,200 employees in late 2022.Investors were skeptical, and a recent devastating quarterly report sent them running for the exits. First Republic shares fell 75% last week and closed Friday at $3.51. Who bought First Republic Bank?JPMorgan Chase — one of the banks that contributed part of the $30 billion in March — has bought the bulk of the bank's operations and assets from the FDIC. The banking giant is acquiring $92 billion in insured and uninsured deposits and will assume $173 billion in loans as well as $30 billion in securities, according to a Monday note from Benjamin Salisbury at Height Securities. The FDIC and JPMorgan will share losses on acquired single-family residential mortgage loans and commercial loans. ""This is an extraordinary series of events,"" noted Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg on Monday. Regulators ""permitted the country's biggest bank to get even bigger.""How much did JPMorgan pay for First Republic Bank?JPMorgan is paying the FDIC $10.6 billion for First Republic, according to Ben Emons of NewEdge Wealth, in a research note. As part of the deal, JPMorgan will absorb about $185 billion of First Republic assets, he noted.JPMorgan ""is now the largest depository institution in the U.S., holding 16.7% of the $17.1 trillion deposits,"" he added.What happens to First Republic Bank's stock and shareholders?The shareholders are most likely wiped out. The stock has stopped trading as of Monday, and shareholders won't receive stock in JPMorgan, according to a JPMorgan spokesman. The New York Stock Exchange said on Tuesday that it is delisting First Republic's shares.The FDIC's insurance fund has a priority claim on the bank's assets, which must be fully reimbursed before the next class of creditors — general trade creditors — can get reimbursed, according to the FDIC. The FDIC estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund at about $13 billion. After that, claims from unsubordinated debt holders are reimbursed. ""If there are any proceeds left, the shareholders are the last in line,"" an FDIC spokesperson said.Shareholders have already taken a wallop. Before entering receivership on Monday, First Republic shares had lost 97% of their value since year start, wiping out more than $21 billion off First Republic's market value.Before it stopped trading, First Republic had a market valuation of about $660 million, according to FactSet. What happens to First Republic Bank deposits?The First Republic deal announced Monday means customers will be able to access all of their money, according to the FDIC. First Republic branches will change to JPMorgan Chase branches and First Republic customers will become JPMorgan Chase customers.""First Republic clients may bank as usual, and feel confident that their deposits are backed by the strength and security of JPMorgan Chase,"" the bank said in an investor presentation on Monday.Is First Republic Bank the same as Republic Bank?No. There are a couple of banks with names similar to First Republic that aren't related.Republic Bank, a Philadelphia-based bank that provides banking services to customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, is trying to get the word out that they aren't related. In a statement on its website, Republic Bank notes, ""What is happening at the California-based bank, one of the nation's largest, has no local impact on Republic Bank.""There's also Republic Bank & Trust in Kentucky, which also is alerting customers on its website that it is ""not related to First Republic Bank.""How big was First Republic Bank?The bank had $229 billion in assets, making it the second-biggest bank to collapse in U.S. history after the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual, which at the time had roughly $307 billion and also was sold to JPMorgan.

The company was the focus of a rescue deal, with 11 of the largest U.S. banks depositing a total of $30 billion in the firm. Deposits fell more than 40% in the first quarter, even with the money from other institutions. Other banks had been reluctant to make a deal because their rescue deposits were uninsured. The FDIC's involvement likely made them be more willing to engage in talks. It had already been a tumultuous week for the firm's share price, which was down more than 75% as at Friday's close. Trading had been paused multiple times throughout the day, as had been done for a few days throughout the week. First Republic shares have lost about 98% of their value since the start of the year. In the last month, short selling First Republic stock increased by 19.2%, with 9.26 million shares worth $53 million shorted, according to research from S3 Partners.

This result is especially welcome for the government politically because by the time it failed, a large number of the uninsured deposits at First Republic were simply money that had been poured in by big banks. Backing those deposits would have been a bad look to the public. But failing to do so would’ve signaled that the government wouldn’t necessarily stand behind any deposits at failing banks — jeopardizing a convenient ambiguity that has helped stabilize the system, at least for now. Still, the FDIC expects to take a $13 billion loss to its deposit insurance fund, financed by fees from banks. That’s because it’s sharing some of the losses from First Republic’s portfolio of residential mortgages and commercial loans. Are more banks going to fail? It’s very possible, but there are no obvious candidates teetering the way First Republic has been. And all three of those failed banks shared clear links: lots of runnable deposits and huge unrealized losses on their books. Financial regulators are keeping an eye out for other risks that accompany higher borrowing costs, such as the potential for losses on commercial real estate, which has been in a period of sustained uncertainty in the wake of the pandemic as large numbers of workers no longer use office space. No doubt other financial firms will experience trouble as interest rates stay high and growth slows. Some might not be banks; government officials worry in particular about nonbank companies such as asset managers and insurers that are less regulated but still interconnected with the banking system. In the meantime, what will matter for the economy is to what extent the stress in the banking system leads lenders to pull back on extending credit, which could slow growth as much as would any further interest rate hikes. So wait, isn’t JPMorgan Chase already huge? Now it’s going to get bigger? This will definitely be a political talking point as Washington looks over the details of the sale. On the one hand, the FDIC selling an insolvent bank to another bank, and sharing in the losses, is generally how bank failures play out. But a lot of Democrats won’t love that a bank they consider “too big to fail” is now getting even bigger. Indeed, JPMorgan normally is barred from buying other banks because it controls more than 10 percent of the deposits in the country. But that cap doesn’t apply when the bank being bought is insolvent. To put things in perspective, First Republic had about $229 billion in assets, the second-largest bank failure in history, behind only Washington Mutual. JPMorgan has more than $3.7 trillion in assets. (One side note: Washington Mutual was also bought by JPMorgan after its collapse in 2008.)",https://static.politico.com/31/0c/7697e0ee402a9a614fa3fa51fd70/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1473331011,2023-05-01,-0.213,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Washington Mutual', 'description': 'former American bank holding company', 'full_name': 'Washington Mutual', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Washington_Mutual_Tower%2C_Seattle%2C_August_2006.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 48.64822006225586, 'longitude': -118.73780822753906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}]",Negative,"- First Republic Bank's failure was politically advantageous for the government as it avoided the need to back uninsured deposits, which were largely funded by large banks.

The bank’s first-quarter revenue increased by 9% from the year before, to $41.9 billion. That’s more than analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected. Earnings per share came in at $4.44, also higher than the $4.17 estimated by FactSet. Still, CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors that trouble could lie ahead. “Many economic indicators continue to be favorable. However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces,” he wrote in a press release Friday. Dimon cited growing geopolitical tensions and “persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue,” as ongoing worries. “We do not know how these factors will play out, but we must prepare the Firm for a wide range of potential environments to ensure that we can consistently be there for clients,” he said. On a call with reporters Friday morning, Dimon said American consumers still have excess savings, stocks are higher and unemployment is low. “Even if we go into recession, they’re in pretty good shape,” he noted. But he also said that lower-income earners are quickly running out of extra money. The bank is beginning to see some cracks in the subprime auto loan market. Dimon, calling in from an investment banking conference in Florida, told reporters that he believes market pricing is likely “too happy” right now and that the chance of a bad outcome is “higher than other people think.” But, Dimon said, “the important thing isn’t the economy — whether we have a mild recession or soft landing or something like that,” he said, referring to a scenario where inflation is vanquished without raising unemployment levels. What’s important, he said, “is the future of the free world,” referring to Russia’s war on Ukraine. “It could be determinative on what happens to the global economy if oil and gas prices go too high,” Dimon said. The impact of ‘higher for longer’ rates JPMorgan Chase acquired most of First Republic Bank’s assets last May after the San Francisco-based regional bank was seized by the government. That acquisition added billions of dollars in loans to the bank’s balance sheet, boosting its income from interest. JPMorgan Chase reported that average loans had increased 16% from the year before, mostly because of First Republic. Net interest income, or NII, from those loans (that’s the money a bank earns from loans minus the interest it pays on deposits) increased by 11% to $23.2 billion. But the bank also said that NII could fall short of Wall Street expectations for the year. Net interest income has been a key metric for analysts this quarter as they look to see how banks react to elevated interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Banks, including JPMorgan, have brought in record profits, boosted by NII, as the central bank raised interest rates. JPMorgan Chase also said on Friday that it would take a one-time $725 million charge by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation related to the mess that Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank left in the wake of their collapses last spring. It was large banks that mostly footed that bill. Shares of the bank fell by 4.3% in morning trading but are up 45% over the last 12 months. Mixed earnings Separately, investment giant BlackRock reported that its assets under management swelled to a record $10.5 trillion during the first quarter. The company also beat top- and bottom-line expectations. Wells Fargo, which also reported its first-quarter earnings Friday, topped Wall Street’s expectations but saw an 8% decline in net interest income from the prior year. The company also noted a $284 million expense during the first quarter related to the FDIC’s special assessment. Citigroup reported net income of $3.4 billion in the first quarter, or $1.58 a share, outpacing analysts’ expectations for $1.18 a share, according to FactSet. CEO Jane Fraser said Friday the bank finished its organizational restructuring, which included layoffs, last month. The company saw $225 million in restructuring charges during the first quarter, largely driven by severance and other corporate reshuffling costs. Citi also noted a $251 million expense related to the FDIC’s cleanup of the regional bank collapses last year. Shares of Wells Fargo were up slightly on Friday morning while shares of BlackRock and Citigroup fell.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1835247155.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2024-04-12,-0.031,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'FactSet', 'description': 'American financial data company', 'full_name': 'FactSet'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Citigroup', 'description': 'American investment bank and financial services corporation', 'full_name': 'Citigroup', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/388_Greenwich_Street_from_Battery_Park_City_North_Esplanade.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'United States', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dimon', 'latitude': 64.12834167480469, 'longitude': -19.906320571899414, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Florida', 'latitude': 28.750539779663086, 'longitude': -82.5000991821289, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Russia', 'latitude': 60.0, 'longitude': 100.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Ukraine', 'latitude': 49.0, 'longitude': 32.0, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NII', 'latitude': 35.23332977294922, 'longitude': 134.7833251953125, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wall Street', 'latitude': 34.590370178222656, 'longitude': -86.82611083984375, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Corporation', 'latitude': 53.37699890136719, 'longitude': -1.4768999814987183, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 47.92502975463867, 'longitude': 19.173559188842773, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'BlackRock', 'latitude': 36.929100036621094, 'longitude': -118.23342895507812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Citi', 'latitude': 9.51846981048584, 'longitude': -69.33296203613281, 'location_type': 'REGION'}]",Not directly related,"- JPMorgan Chase acquired most of First Republic Bank's assets in May 2022, adding billions of dollars in loans to its balance sheet.

While the leading brokerage firm and money manager is not typically viewed as a bank, it does have a significant banking arm, and it took a big hit during last year’s banking crisis. Schwab suffered from deposit outflows during the crisis, as customers took their money out for higher-yielding options, like money markets, during a time of high interest rates. Close-up of sign with logo at Charles Schwab financial adviser branch in Pleasanton, California, ... [+] March 26, 2018. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Getty Images This flight reduced a valuable funding source for the company and forced Schwab to seek out other sources of funding, which were more expensive and ultimately reduced its margins. This hurt earnings and led to several analysts’ downgrades – and the combination of factors caused the stock price to fall more than 30% in Q1 last year to below $50 per share. The sell-off provided the opportunity for investors to snag one of the most reliable, consistent, and best-performing financial stocks at a discount – and several fund managers took advantage of it. A long term bargain Schwab’s stock price did rebound a bit from that initial sell-off, as deposits started to come back in the fourth quarter, up 2% from the third quarter, but still down 21% year-over-year. However, the share price was still down some 16% in 2023 as earnings growth was challenged, in part due to higher expenses related to the integration of TD Ameritrade into the Schwab platform. But now that the integration is mostly complete, the company should see some $500 million in cost savings from the integration starting in 2024. The volatility, however, signaled a green light for portfolio managers at Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, which runs the Sequoia Fund. While Schwab was the worst performing stock in the portfolio last year, the management team could not pass up the chance to buy more shares when it dipped below $50 per share. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor “Rising interest rates have impacted the business in ways both predictable and unpredictable, but the net result has been a crimping of earnings that will likely persist for another year or two. Critically, we do not believe any of these transitory dynamics pose, or ever posed, any existential risk to the business. Further, Schwab’s enviable, high-return franchise remains, in our view, entirely intact. If we are right on both these counts, we should generate an attractive return from the current stock price across a range of long-term interest rate scenarios,” Sequoia Fund managers wrote in their Q4 letter to shareholders. They added that at the discounted price, the stock trades at a low-double-digit multiple of likely earnings per share a couple years – as higher interest rates should ultimately help earnings as deposits continue to come back, particularly as interest rates have likely peaked. Giverny Capital Asset Management also jumped at the opportunity to buy Schwab when it was trading in the $50 per share range – boosting its position several times last year. “I believe in this business and its earnings power over the next few years. However, Schwab qualifies as a poor manager of its own balance sheet,” David Poppe, president and co-founder of Giverny Capital wrote in the Q4 letter to investors. “Unlike First Republic Bank, however, Schwab continued gathering billions of dollars of brokerage assets all year, shoring up its capital position. The flow of new money into Schwab meant it had plenty of capital on hand, even after marking down the value of longer-dated bonds.” Ultimately, Poppe wrote that Schwab has significant long-term earnings power and will “power through its mishap(s).” A different view Ariel Investments, which holds Schwab in its Ariel Appreciation Fund, is also bullish on the stock. Ariel fund managers, in their fourth quarter commentary, said its scale, bolstered by the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, and “customer-centric focus” should enhance its “industry leading cost advantage.” But not all were in lockstep, as Right Tail Capital sold shares in Schwab last March. In his fourth quarter letter to shareholders, Right Tail founder Jeremy Kokemor said that while Schwab was in good shape relative to the troubled and failed banks, with limited uninsured deposits and sticky institutional assets, there were challenges to sort through, like raising capital to deal with the liquidity challenges. “Ultimately, I felt my time and energy would be better spent trying to find the next great Right Tail investment than in trying to untangle Schwab. I sold the stock in the mid to high $50s and used the proceeds to add to our existing positions that I felt best about,” Kokemor wrote. Ultimately, the fund returned 29% in 2023, topping the S&P 500. Schwab’s share price is back up to $71 per share, still short of the $85 per share price it reached before the crisis, but up some 30% to 40% off its lows when it was trading in the low $50s. Analysts rate it as a consensus buy, with a price target of around $75, but the managers who recently added it are looking farther out and see value in the long term.

The lawsuit marks the latest fallout for the FDIC from three bank failures earlier this year that cost the agency's deposit insurance fund about $32 billion and have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The lawsuit was filed on Dec. 5 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California but has not been previously reported. With assets of more than $200 billion, First Republic in May became the largest bank to fail since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, despite efforts by major banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N)New Tab, opens new tab to right the ship, including a $30 billion infusion of deposits in March of this year. Advertisement · Scroll to continue As receiver, the FDIC in May sold virtually all the bank's assets to JP Morgan, which assumed all deposits as well. In their complaint, the former employees allege that in mid-May the FDIC stopped payments intended for them under a deferred compensation plan that First Republic had earlier established for them in a trust. They say the FDIC instead began treating them as unsecured creditors, meaning they could be left with nothing. ""It's really inequitable. The employees are the ones that kept the bank healthy and profitable,"" said attorney Timothy Walsh of Winston & Strawn. His clients did not include any of the top executives whose alleged mismanagement contributed to First Republic's demise, Walsh added. ""They should not be penalized in this process."" Walsh said the FDIC's resolution of First Republic protected the Wall Street banks that injected deposits, while the former employees' retirement funds were much smaller. First Republic's failure cost the FDIC about $15 billion, according to a recent estimate.

Its scope covered 2018 until the bank’s failure on May 1. On that day, First Republic announced its sale to JPMorgan Chase, which acquired the majority of its assets and assumed its deposits and certain other liabilities. The transaction was necessitated by stock declines at the bank following the failure of SVB that proved irreversible despite cash injections from other large U.S. banks. “[T]here were attributes of First Republic’s business model and management strategies that made it more vulnerable to interest rate changes and the contagion that ensued following the failure of SVB,” said the FDIC report, including: Rapid growth and loan and funding concentrations; Overreliance on uninsured deposits and depositor loyalty; and Failure to sufficiently mitigate interest rate risk. The report further pointed to the effects of an April 24 earnings call, where it was disclosed the bank lost more than $100 billion in deposits during the first quarter of 2023, as a cause for negative market reaction that could not be overcome. Regarding its supervision of First Republic, the FDIC “could have been more forward-looking in assessing how increasing interest rates could negatively impact the bank” and “could have done more to effectively challenge and encourage bank management to implement strategies to mitigate interest rate risk,” according to the report. The analysis also found the FDIC could have better collaborated with its San Franciso regional office regarding challenging the bank management’s strategies and assumptions. “We cannot say whether taking earlier supervisory action such as criticizing interest rate risk or liquidity risk management would have prevented First Republic from failing given the significance and speed of deposit withdrawals,” the report concluded. “However, meaningful action to mitigate interest rate risk and address funding concentrations would have made the bank more resilient and less vulnerable to the March 2023 contagion event.” The report’s findings mirror those of the Federal Reserve regarding its review of its supervision efforts at SVB published in April. In the aftermath of the collapses, the Fed, FDIC, and other U.S. banking regulators have come together to propose rule changes designed to allow the FDIC greater flexibility in dealing with failing banks.",https://d6jxgaftxvagq.cloudfront.net/Pictures/2000xAny/7/4/7/17747_first_republic_web_332085.jpg,2023-09-11,-0.239,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Marshall', 'latitude': 42.27225875854492, 'longitude': -84.96331024169922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Negative,"- The FDIC's review of First Republic's collapse identified vulnerabilities in its business model, including rapid growth, loan and funding concentrations, overreliance on uninsured deposits, and insufficient mitigation of interest rate risk.

Revenue for the bank totalled $42.6bn, above expectations of $41.9bn, while earnings per share sat at $4.44, compared to estimates of $4.11. Significantly, the bank posted a $1.9bn provision for credit losses in the quarter, 17 per cent smaller than a year ago and far below the $2.7bn expected by analysts. JPMorgan added billions in loans to its balance sheet after acquiring First Republic Bank last year following its collapse. This pushed average loans up 16 per cent, but these were only up three per cent when First Republic was excluded, while assets under management jumped 19 per cent to $3.6 trillion thanks in part to the acquisition. However, trading revenue declined five per cent to $8bn, while revenue from fixed income, currency and commodities dropped seven per cent. Revenue from equities was flat. Investment banking revenue jumped 27 per cent to $2bn, due to higher fees on debt and stock underwriting. While many other financial institutions are reducing their headcount, JPMorgan actually added around 2,000 employees to its workforce of 311,921, five per cent higher than a year earlier. Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s chair and CEO, said that while many economic indicators were favourable, the bank remained “alert to a number of significant uncertain forces”. He warned of ongoing geopolitical tensions, as well as the “large number of persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue”. Dimon also cautioned about the full effect of quantitative tightening, which he said we have “never truly experienced” on this scale. “We do not know how these factors will play out, but we must prepare the firm for a wide range of potential environments to ensure that we can consistently be there for clients,” the CEO said.",https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-465591431-e1712921430525.jpg,2024-04-12,-0.472,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JP Morgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 37.12166976928711, 'longitude': -93.47138977050781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dimon', 'latitude': 64.12834167480469, 'longitude': -19.906320571899414, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}]",Not directly related,"- JPMorgan acquired First Republic Bank last year, which added billions in loans to its balance sheet and pushed average loans up 16%.

Federal Home Loan Banks: Actions Related to the Spring 2023 Bank Failures - Government Accountability Office,Federal Home Loan Banks: Actions Related to the Spring 2023 Bank Failures  Government Accountability Office,"Fri, 08 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdhby5nb3YvcHJvZHVjdHMvZ2FvLTI0LTEwNjk1N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Government Accountability Office,"What GAO Found Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank had borrowed substantial secured loans, or advances, from their respective Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) before their failures in spring 2023. As of year-end 2022, each of the three banks held substantially more FHLBank advances (as a proportion of their total assets) than a group of their peer banks. The three banks increased their outstanding FHLBank advances by 37 to 50 percent in the first 2 weeks of March 2023, when SVB and Signature Bank failed (see table). First Republic Bank’s outstanding advances then largely stabilized until the bank failed on May 1. Percentage Changes in Outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank Advances for Failed Banks, March 1, 2023–Failure Date Source: GAO analysis of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) advance data. | GAO-24-106957 Prior to the three bank failures, the FHLBanks of New York and San Francisco reviewed examination reports for the three failed banks and stated that they met regularly with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Banks, and other regulators. The two FHLBanks and FDIC communicated about Signature Bank and First Republic Bank as the banks were declining. In addition, the two FHLBanks relied on established policies, procedures, and agreements with the relevant Federal Reserve Banks to help Signature Bank and First Republic Bank access additional funding. However, officials from the FHLBank of San Francisco said that SVB failed before they could coordinate with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to request additional supervisory information or facilitate SVB’s access to additional funding. Since the bank failures, the FHLBanks have received full repayment for SVB’s and Signature Bank’s advances. The bank that acquired First Republic Bank’s advances has indicated that it intends to repay the advances according to the advance terms. Why GAO Did This Study Between March 10 and May 1, 2023, state banking supervisors closed SVB, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank and named FDIC as receiver. The three failed banks had borrowed substantial secured loans (known as advances) from their respective FHLBanks before their failures. The FHLBanks are government-sponsored enterprises that support liquidity by making advances to member financial institutions and promote housing and community development. SVB and First Republic Bank were members of the FHLBank of San Francisco, and Signature Bank was a member of the FHLBank of New York. GAO was asked to review the role of the FHLBanks with regard to the recent bank failures. This report provides information on the FHLBanks’ funding to the failed banks, their communication and coordination with FDIC and the Federal Reserve System (the failed banks’ primary federal regulators), and repayment of the failed banks’ outstanding advances. This report is one in a series of reports about the bank failures. GAO plans to follow this report with work on broader issues related to the FHLBanks. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations; publications, policies, procedures, and other documentation and data from the FHLBanks and the federal banking regulators; and publicly available regulatory reporting data for the three failed banks. GAO also interviewed officials from the FHLBanks, federal banking regulators, and others.

4 Key Takeaways From Jamie Dimon's Annual Shareholder Letter - Investopedia,4 Key Takeaways From Jamie Dimon's Annual Shareholder Letter  Investopedia,"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 16:37:43 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vNC1rZXktdGFrZWF3YXlzLWZyb20tamFtaWUtZGltb24tYW5udWFsLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLWxldHRlci04NjI4MTk30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Investopedia,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chair and CEO Jamie Dimon released his annual letter to shareholders Monday, giving his perspective on a range of topics from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) to the health of the economy and its outlook. The influential CEO also touched on America's role in international conflicts, climate change, and JPMorgan's plans to support a number of initiatives related to diversity and inclusion, among other things. JPMorgan shares were up about 0.5% at $198.44 in early trading Monday after Dimon's letter was released, as well as the company's annual proxy statement in which it said a transition to a new CEO is a ""top priority"" for the medium term. Growing Role of AI Amid a boom in demand in AI, Dimon highlighted the ""critical impact"" of the technology, and said that JPMorgan has taken a number of steps to expand its capabilities with AI. Dimon said the company currently uses AI in over 400 different ways, from fraud detection to finding new marketing strategies, with plans to explore whether using generative AI for things like customer service or software development could help the business. ""While we do not know the full effect or the precise rate at which AI will change our business—or how it will affect society at large—we are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others,"" Dimon wrote. Soft Landing Could Be Less Likely Than Markets Expect While the markets are currently pricing an a 70% to 80% chance of the economy executing a ""soft landing,"" with modest growth and declining inflation and interest rates, Dimon said ""I believe the odds are a lot lower than that."" Dimon said JPMorgan is prepared to weather a wide range of circumstances, including interest rates from 2% to 8%, and a recession to a strong economy. He also warned against focusing too much on monthly inflation data or slight changes to interest rates, when pressures like high government spending and restructuring of global trade could keep inflation high. Rising Regulatory Requirements In his letter, Dimon noted the financial industry has seen thousands of new rules introduced since the Dodd-Frank Act enacted after the 2008 financial crisis, and argued in favor of reevaluating some regulatory steps taken. ""It would probably be an understatement to say that some are duplicative, inconsistent, procyclical, contradictory, extremely costly, and unnecessarily painful for both banks and regulators,"" he said, writing many banks from smaller banks to larger regional banks ""may not have the resources to handle all of these regulatory requirements."" Greater collaboration between banks and regulators, Dimon said, ""would reduce confusion and uncertainty and would lead to better outcomes for banks, their shareholders, and their clients, customers and communities."" Update on First Republic Acquisition in Aftermath of 2023 Banking Crisis After nearly a year since its purchase of First Republic Bank, Dimon said JPMorgan expects to have most of its integration of First Republic Bank's systems with JPMorgan's policies and existing systems complete by later this year. JPMorgan now projects First Republic will add about $2 billion to its annual revenue, compared to initial estimates of $500 million. ""By purchasing First Republic Bank, we brought much-needed stability to the U.S. banking system,"" Dimon wrote, noting ""when we purchased First Republic in May 2023 following the failure of two other regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, we thought that the current banking crisis was over."" However, Dimon warned that if interest rates rise or there is a recession, “there will be plenty of stress—not just in the banking system but with leveraged companies and others.”",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/jMhk1uq5sNtMBPswMtu1UBs-lLQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1835546589-bd8b6187fde445099135e9351a25b68d.jpg,2024-04-08,0.063,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dimon', 'latitude': 64.12834167480469, 'longitude': -19.906320571899414, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Dodd', 'latitude': 40.287200927734375, 'longitude': -103.70745086669922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Not directly related,"- JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank in May 2023 following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

FDIC Terminates First Republic's 212K SF Hudson Yards Office Lease - Bisnow,FDIC Terminates First Republic's 212K SF Hudson Yards Office Lease  Bisnow,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpc25vdy5jb20vbmV3LXlvcmsvbmV3cy9vZmZpY2UvZmRpYy10ZXJtaW5hdGVzLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljcy0yMTJrLXNmLWh1ZHNvbi15YXJkcy1sZWFzZS0xMjE2MDHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Bisnow,"Following its failure earlier this year, First Republic Bank's large new Hudson Yards office space is getting handed back over to its landlord, Bisnow has learned. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has terminated First Republic's 212K SF lease at 410 10th Ave., an executive with 601W Cos., which owns the building, told Bisnow. JPMorgan Chase bought most of First Republic's assets from the FDIC in May, but it never took over the space in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of Manhattan, a JPMorgan spokesperson said Friday. The FDIC took possession of the lease from First Republic in late September and has been working on a termination agreement with 601W Cos. that went into effect within the last 10 days, said the 601W executive, who declined to be identified because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. The FDIC didn't immediately respond to Bisnow’s request for comment, although federal and local government agencies are closed Friday in observance of Veterans Day. First Republic pre-leased the Class-A office space at 410 10th Ave. in 2019 from SL Green, which acquired the property and undertook a $240M gut renovation. Amazon is the largest tenant at the 640K SF building, occupying 330K SF in a lease that expires in 2037, according to the Morningstar Credit database. 601W Cos. bought the building in December 2020 for $953M, then the largest office sale in the U.S. since the onset of the pandemic. JPMorgan Chase provided a $705M debt package for the acquisition, The Real Deal reported, which was securitized into several CMBS loans that are set to mature in 2028. The senior debt totals $565M, with another $140M in mezzanine financing, according to documents filed when the loan was securitized. First Republic’s lease in the building was due to expire in September 2036. The request for a lease termination triggered a clause in the loan for 601W Cos. that requires the borrower to deposit all excess cash flow from 410 10th Ave. into an account controlled by the loan's servicer. The servicer placed the loan on a watchlist as a result. The building is cash flow-positive even without rent from First Republic, the executive said, adding that the landlord is already speaking to at least two tenants looking to occupy the space left by the failed bank. The space is being marketed by JLL. First Republic moved into the fully furnished space in 2020, but because of the pandemic and flexible work policies, it “never fully occupied it,” according to the executive. “It’s not the outcome we wanted, for First Republic to leave, but we have the bones that you want in a building,” the person said. Other tenants in the building include bakery Maman, which has a ground-floor lease in the property, and Hudson Yards Construction LLC, which occupies 38K SF in a lease due to expire next month, according to Morningstar Credit's database. Rents in the area have increased since the onset of the pandemic, the spokesperson said. Asking rents for Class-A properties in the Penn Station submarket, where 410 10th Ave. sits, were $118.67 per SF during the third quarter, according to Cushman & Wakefield data. The submarket's vacancy rate was 22.5%. The termination shows that the dust still hasn't settled following regional bank collapses this spring. Credit Suisse, Signature Bank and First Republic occupied approximately 2M SF in New York City alone as of March.

Keeping these considerations in mind, Rolfe’s 13F filing for the three months ended June 30 shows he entered three new positions, sold out of four stocks and added to or trimmed a number of other existing investments. The most significant trades included a boost to the PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL, Financial) position, reduced bets on Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial), Meta Platforms Inc. (META, Financial) and Visa Inc. (V, Financial) and the divestment of First Republic Bank (FRCB, Financial).

FDIC OIG report identifies areas for improvement in First Republic Bank's oversight - American Banker,FDIC OIG report identifies areas for improvement in First Republic Bank's oversight  American Banker,"Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmFua2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZkaWMtb2lnLXJlcG9ydC1pZGVudGlmaWVzLWFyZWFzLWZvci1pbXByb3ZlbWVudC1pbi1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy1iYW5rcy1vdmVyc2lnaHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,American Banker,"WASHINGTON — First Republic Bank's May failure followed the dramatic failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the preceding weeks, and a new report from the the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s inspector general suggests the FDIC may have missed some opportunities to more effectively address risks leading up to the firm's collapse. A material-loss review commissioned by the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General shed light on the circumstances leading to the failure of First Republic Bank. The comprehensive examination, conducted by Cotton & Company Assurance and Advisory, said the FDIC could have implemented more timely supervisory actions, including downgrading the firm's component ratings and reassessing guidance concerning the substantial quantity of uninsured deposits that ultimately fled from the bank. The report emphasizes the need for the agency to take a hard look at some of the triggers the agency uses to define bank health, saying the agency’s current capital measures classified the bank as well-capitalized up until its failure. ""The bank’s failure may warrant changes to the guidelines establishing standards for safety and soundness, including the adoption of noncapital triggers requiring regulatory actions,"" the report notes. The Inspector General of the FDIC is required to conduct material loss reviews following the failure of a financial institution to determine the causes that led to the institution's downfall and resulted in a material loss to the deposit insurance fund. The material-loss review attributed the demise of San Francisco-based First Republic to contagion effects stemming from the failure of other major financial institutions like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank months prior. The review noted a run on deposits severely impacted the bank's liquidity, revealing vulnerabilities in its business strategy. The review also pointed to the bank's reliance on attracting high-net-worth customers with competitive loan terms and funding growth through low-cost deposits, which heightened the concentration of uninsured deposits and increased the bank’s sensitivity to interest rate risk. “This strategy ultimately led to a significant asset/liability mismatch for the bank, and fair value declines on its portfolio of low-yielding, long-duration loans, which limited its ability to obtain sufficient liquidity and prevented its recovery,” the review noted. The report proposed 11 recommendations to improve the FDIC's supervision processes including reviewing examination guidance, establishing communication protocols for large banks, updating examination instructions, conducting reviews on contagion risk factors and the supervisory approach to contagion risk, exploring processes for monitoring large bank liquidity risk, adding institutions to the supplemental offsite review list, assessing fair value for long-term loans and engaging with other regulators to evaluate potential changes to regulations under Section 39 of the FDI Act, which empowers the agencies to establish safety and soundness standards. FDIC agreed with all 11 recommendations and will complete the actions by the summer of next year. “The FDIC concurs with this recommendation and will engage with the other regulators to evaluate why the changes to the regulations promulgated under Section 39 of the FDI Act may be warranted to address noncapital triggers to take actions related to unsafe and unsound practices,” the FDIC wrote in its response letter to the report. “The FDIC will document the results of that engagement and evaluation with the other regulators by March 31 2024.”",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/a4/60/bcb6dcda40968268ea57281c66d7/first-republic.jpg,2023-11-30,-0.37,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'WASHINGTON', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 42.75035858154297, 'longitude': -71.83702087402344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Inspector', 'latitude': 15.443519592285156, 'longitude': 120.87570190429688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Cotton', 'latitude': 44.699180603027344, 'longitude': -85.05338287353516, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 48.64822006225586, 'longitude': -118.73780822753906, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Section', 'latitude': 34.57897186279297, 'longitude': -85.98664093017578, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Negative,"- First Republic Bank failed in May 2023, following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

Eugene (Gene) H. Martino, who spent almost a decade at First Republic Bank, joined UBS on Friday. He had been managing around $287 million at First Republic, the source said, and in 2021, he was ranked #232 on Forbes’ best-in-state wealth advisors list. Martino is based out of UBS’s midtown Manhattan office and reports to Neal Cooper, market director at the firm’s Avenue of the Americas office. Martino started his career in 1986 at E.F. Hutton & Co. where he remained through several mergers until joining BNY Mellon in 1996 as a portfolio manager and managing director, according to his BrokerCheck and LinkedIn profiles. He shifted to First Republic in 2011 with the corporate title of wealth manager, according to LinkedIn. A UBS spokesperson confirmed the hire, and a JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment. Martino did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent through social media. Martino’s move to UBS follows two former First Republic brokers who joined the wirehouse last month. Mark W. Alibrandi and Stephen Alibrandi, who call their practice Alibrandi Wealth Management, joined UBS’s Private Wealth Management in Boston on June 22 and had $5.1 million in annual production at First Republic. Also in Boston, UBS picked up a $2.3 million producing broker, Shannon McAllister, who had managed around $450 million in assets at First Republic, on June 15. Both McAllister and the Alibrandi team report to Boston market director Max Bardeem. Since the regional banking crisis started in mid-March, First Republic brokers managing nearly $50 billion in combined client assets have left for other firms, according to an AdvisorHub tally. Including Friday’s move, at least six teams have moved to UBS. First Republic’s wealth business had almost $290 billion in client assets under management prior to its collapse. JPMorgan executives said last month that its purchase of First Republic in May will give its J.P. Morgan Advisors business a substantial boost, although retention offers only apply to those with at least $2.5 million in revenue, sources said previously.",https://www.advisorhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/UBS.jpg,2023-07-10,-0.224,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'LinkedIn', 'description': 'social networking website for people in professional occupations', 'full_name': 'LinkedIn', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Linkedin_screenshot.png'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'UBS', 'latitude': 47.32661056518555, 'longitude': 8.800040245056152, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'USA', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 39.92361831665039, 'longitude': -97.82170867919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New York', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Eugene', 'latitude': 44.05207061767578, 'longitude': -123.08674621582031, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Forbes', 'latitude': 48.616798400878906, 'longitude': -89.65013885498047, 'location_type': 'REGION'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Martino', 'latitude': 54.907779693603516, 'longitude': 67.1963882446289, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Manhattan', 'latitude': 40.714271545410156, 'longitude': -74.00596618652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Avenue', 'latitude': 38.25624084472656, 'longitude': -76.76775360107422, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Boston', 'latitude': 42.358428955078125, 'longitude': -71.05976867675781, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'McAllister', 'latitude': 45.32720184326172, 'longitude': -87.72122192382812, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Negative,"- Eugene (Gene) H.

The Norcross-Braca group owns just under 10% of Republic First's outstanding shares, according to a report filed Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Norcross, executive chairman of the Camden, New Jersey-based insurance consulting firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, leads the group, which includes his brother Philip, a prominent New Jersey attorney, and former TD Bank CEO Greg Braca. According to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. statistics, Republic First, the holding company for Republic Bank, reported a core capital ratio of 5.56%, lower than the industry average of 8.74%. In March, Republic First announced plans to raise $125 million in capital in partnership with an investor group led by Castle Creek Capital, only to see the transaction — announced the same day Silicon Valley Bank failed — come apart in May. The failure prompted sharp criticism from the Norcross-Braca group, which wasn't party to the deal. Additional capital would address a pressing need for Republic First, providing ""greater flexibility to invest in the business and deliver extraordinary service to our loyal customer base and depositors,"" CEO Thomas Geisel said Wednesday in the press release. ""We plan to work with the Norcross-Braca group to put Republic on the best footing possible to enhance value for all shareholders."" Both Republic First and the Norcross-Braca group declined further comment. If the capital raise is successful, the Norcross-Braca group has also agreed to drop all litigation against Republic First and cease proxy solicitation efforts. Last week, Republic First announced a postponement of its annual meeting, which had been scheduled for Oct. 5, until Dec. 19. The Norcross-Braca group had planned to seek three board seats at the annual meeting. In addition to capital, the agreement between Republic First and the Norcross-Braca group includes adding two seats to the company's seven-member board of directors and overhauling its membership. Norcross-Braca would gain the right to appoint two directors. Another two seats would be allocated to third-party investors, while two new independent directors would be selected. Geisel would occupy one of the three remaining board seats, leaving just two for current directors. Neither Republic First nor the Norcross-Braca group have given any indication of who would occupy seats on the reconstituted board. Republic First also agreed to pay the Norcross-Braca group at least $10.5 million, part as a consulting fee and part to reimburse the group for legal, investment banking and other expenses as part of a final arrangement. News of the nonbinding letter of intent came two weeks after the Norcross-Braca group announced it would pause its litigation efforts and offered encouragement to Republic First in its effort to attract new capital. ""We remain actively engaged with the company and other parties on capital raising solutions,"" George Norcross said in a Sept. 11 statement. The lengthy and frequently bitter struggle has contributed to a steep decline in the value of Republic First stock. Shares, which traded at $2.12 at the beginning of 2023, were selling for 19 cents Thursday afternoon.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/d5/dc/3863ef964ddaba685040a308bade/a7bd2e9a-8c2d-460b-b50a-1d2307bde0c9.jpeg,2023-09-28,-0.39,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic', 'latitude': 41.12166976928711, 'longitude': -83.01750183105469, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Norcross', 'latitude': 45.62948989868164, 'longitude': -68.80254364013672, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philadelphia', 'latitude': 39.95233917236328, 'longitude': -75.16378784179688, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Camden', 'latitude': 39.92594909667969, 'longitude': -75.11962127685547, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'New Jersey', 'latitude': 40.16706085205078, 'longitude': -74.49987030029297, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Conner', 'latitude': 17.796390533447266, 'longitude': 121.32749938964844, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Philip', 'latitude': 32.88766860961914, 'longitude': -79.81397247314453, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Castle Creek', 'latitude': 47.002750396728516, 'longitude': -109.34461975097656, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Geisel', 'latitude': 51.340721130371094, 'longitude': 11.979140281677246, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sept', 'latitude': 51.26667022705078, 'longitude': 4.783329963684082, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Neutral,"- Republic First Bancorp, a $6 billion-asset, Philadelphia-based company, is seeking to raise $40 million from third-party investors to address its pressing need for additional capital.

A federal agency has been auctioning off Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank's wine collections, after seizing control of the failed lenders and their assets this spring. The bottles are far from the strangest assets to end up in government hands as a result of bank collapses. Heritage Auctions shelled out about $150,000 including fees for about 1,900 bottles of wine previously owned by SVB, and close to $20,000 for more than 400 bottles from First Republic's cellar, The Wall Street Journal reported. The auctioneer secured the wines at a roughly 40% discount to their market value, the newspaper said. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantees deposits of up to $250,000 in a single FDIC-insured bank. It covers the cost of providing that protection in part by collecting dues from banks and selling assets it seizes. The FDIC has found itself in possession of many weird and wonderful ""specialty assets"" previously owned by banks. The list includes 25,000 pounds of frozen rabbit, a 12% stake in the Dallas Cowboys in the 1980s, and even a cooler containing a human skull, an agency representative told the Journal. The FDIC also seized company planes, pianos, aquariums, and derelict churches and synagogues. Once it wound up with a coal mine that was apparently on fire the same day its owner shut down, the newspaper reported. ""I guess you could say that the failed-bank side of the FDIC's work reflects the diversity of the banking business, from earth to the heavens above,"" Jay Rosenstein, an agency employee who highlighted the strangest seizures in an internal newsletter, wrote in 2006, per the Journal. The government's haul from First Republic also included a 13-seater corporate jet, and a pair of nine-pound eagle figurines that were handmade in France from Baccarat crystal, according to the report.

Casey, a veteran manager at Morgan Stanley’s private wealth management unit in New York City, is set to join regional bank Citizens Financial Group as head of wealth management, according to an announcement on Monday. Casey, who led a “flagship” private wealth branch based in Morgan Stanley’s midtown Manhattan headquarters, will start at Citizens on June 9 after serving out his required garden leave notice period, according to the announcement. Casey replaces Christopher Weyrauch, who left Citizens in January, and will report to Brendan Coughlin, head of consumer banking. “His experience in building a world-class Private Wealth business at one of the top firms in the U.S. will be invaluable as we aspire to build a preeminent Private Wealth offering,” Coughlin said in a statement. The Providence, Rhode Island-based bank has been seeking to jumpstart growth at its wealth business, which managed around $22 billion in assets as of last summer. In December, it launched a new private wealth unit with the hire of Thomas B. Metzger, a former Wells Fargo manager and senior recruiter at First Republic Bank. Citizens also announced in February that it had hired Michael Cherny, a former regional manager at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s bank brokerage unit, to lead Citizens Wealth Management Advisors, a group focused on serving mass affluent customers. Both Metzger, who had been with JPMorgan since it purchased First Republic in May 2023, and Cherny will report to Casey. Casey did not return a request for comment sent through LinkedIn. A Morgan Stanley spokesperson declined to comment on his departure or whether it plans to replace him. His former office managed around $90 billion in assets, according to Citizens’ announcement. Casey started his career at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in 2002 in a product development role, according to LinkedIn. He also worked in a strategy role before becoming chief operating officer of the private wealth segment in 2010 and moved into the market executive role overseeing the private wealth office in 2017, according to the job networking site. Overall, Morgan Stanley’s private wealth unit includes around 300 teams who manage $619 billion in assets for ultra-wealthy clients, according to Casey’s former website. Citizens, which bid unsuccessfully on the failed First Republic Bank last year, has since scooped up around 200 of its former relationship managers with connections to its ultra-high net worth clientele. In October, it moved those hires into a new private bank unit that executives have said will provide referrals for Metzger’s private wealth advisors.

What We Learned From Big Bank Earnings on Friday - Investopedia,What We Learned From Big Bank Earnings on Friday  Investopedia,"Sat, 13 Apr 2024 19:16:48 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vd2hhdC13ZS1sZWFybmVkLWZyb20tYmlnLWJhbmstZWFybmluZ3Mtb24tZnJpZGF5LTg2MzA2MzPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Investopedia,"Large U.S. banks kicked off the first-quarter earnings report season by disclosing higher-than-expected profits. But their net interest income—a key performance indicator for the sector—fell shy of projections. Thanks primarily to surging revenue from investment banking and trading activities, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) all surpassed consensus earnings projections from analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. However, net interest income at each declined from the fourth quarter. That's because interest rates that banks charge on loans may have risen with the Fed's rate hikes, but so have the banks' deposit costs—what they pay out on interest-bearing deposits. At JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, net interest income dropped 4% from the previous quarter, falling for the first time in 11 quarters. Net interest income for the first three months of this year also fell 4% at Wells Fargo and 6% at Citigroup compared the prior quarter. Fed's No Longer Feeding Net Interest Income Growth Because of low interest rates, U.S. banks for more than a decade struggled to earn much of a difference between what they charged for loans and paid on deposits. The Fed's interest rate increases to battle inflation in 2022-23 changed that equation, and net interest income rose. Friday's first-quarter data, though, indicate those halcyon days for banks may have ended, even as persistent inflation, emphasized by JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jamie Dimon in his comments accompanying the company's results, has dimmed the prospect of Fed rate cuts this year. Compared with the first quarter of 2023, net interest income increased 11% at JPMorgan, though its purchase of troubled First Republic Bank's assets last year accounted for most of the gain. Net interest income inched 1% higher at Citi compared with the same quarter a year ago but fell 8% at Wells Fargo. Overall, JPMorgan's net income rose 6% compared with a year ago. But profits fell 8% at Wells Fargo and plunged 27% at Citi. Boost from Investment Banking, Trading Nonetheless, revenue and profit rose comfortably at all three banking giants from the fourth quarter. Reflecting the resilience of the U.S. markets and economy, earnings benefited from surging investment banking and trading revenue. In addition, reduced provisions for credit losses signal that U.S. consumers remain in relatively decent financial shape. Investment banking units struggled throughout much of last year amid a dearth of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). But as Moody's noted earlier this week, equity and bond issuance rose markedly in the fourth quarter, fueling a resurgence for large investment banks. The continuing rally in the U.S. stock market provided plentiful opportunities for banks' trading desks, and they took advantage. At Citi, for example, revenue in its Markets division though lower compared with the year-ago quarter, rose 59% from the fourth quarter to almost $5.4 billion, and investment banking and corporate lending revenue surged 68% to $1.8 billion. Combined, those gains accounted for the bulk of the firm's overall revenue increase. Corporate and investment banking revenue increased 24% more than the prior quarter at both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, constituting the bulk of overall revenue gains at those companies, as well. Credit Goes to Consumers Aiding profits for all three banks during the quarter: A decline in the amount of money they set aside for potential loan losses. Concerns have increased that consumers have run out of cash as credit card balances rise. That also has heightened worries that loan defaults will increase. But it's not a concern the big banks imparted in their first-quarter results. All three banks reduced their provisions for credit losses considerably in the first quarter on a sequential basis. One potential sign that consumers might have started pulling back, appeared, though. Loan balances for all three banks fell slightly during the quarter as interest rates remain high. If that continues, banks may have to reduce loan rates to drum up demand. That, in turn, would place further downward pressure on net interest income.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/1Kj8bWOBfFOCmmqZfzkHjpIscwc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1328719211-a49a29a8ee0447e893396af468166055.jpg,2024-04-13,-0.259,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'JPMorgan Chase', 'description': 'American multinational banking and financial services holding company', 'full_name': 'JP Morgan Chase', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/383_Madison_Ave_Bear_Stearns_C_R_Flickr_1.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Citigroup', 'description': 'American investment bank and financial services corporation', 'full_name': 'Citigroup', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/388_Greenwich_Street_from_Battery_Park_City_North_Esplanade.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Citi', 'latitude': -18.14944076538086, 'longitude': 34.828330993652344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Moody', 'latitude': 33.590938568115234, 'longitude': -86.4908218383789, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]",Positive,Not-related content.
US regional bank shares rally after Western Alliance reports deposit growth - Yahoo Canada Shine On,US regional bank shares rally after Western Alliance reports deposit growth  Yahoo Canada Shine On,"Sun, 14 Apr 2024 13:03:34 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL3VzLXJlZ2lvbmFsLWJhbmstc2hhcmVzLWp1bXAtMTA0NjM5ODc4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Canada Shine On,"By Niket Nishant and Chibuike Oguh (Reuters) -Shares of U.S. regional lenders jumped on Wednesday on growing investor confidence that the worst of the banking crisis was likely over, following news of strong deposit growth at Western Alliance Bancorp. Deposits at Western Alliance grew by more than $2 billion in the three months to May 12, the bank said on Tuesday, suggesting customers remained confident of its financial health after three regional lenders failed in recent months: Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said Western Alliance's deposit growth disclosure was good news for worried investors. ""Western Alliance, one of the most hard-hit banks, came out with a filing showing deposit increase. And as these banks start to show that deposits have stabilized, more confidence is built back into the space in general,"" Hogan said. Western Alliance shares, which are down 41% year-to-date, surged 10% to $34.81, erasing losses recorded over the last two weeks. Other regional lenders closed higher: PacWest Bancorp, whose stock has lost nearly 76% of its value year-to-date, spiked 22%. Comerica Inc gained 12.3%, Zions Bancorp added 12%, KeyCorp rose 8.6%. The KBW Regional Banking Index rose 7.3%, jumping to its highest level since May 1. ""We're not going to make it back to pre-crisis levels anytime soon because we do know that the earnings environment for regional banks will still be impaired, but the period of emergency seems to be dissipating and there's more focusing on the fundamentals,"" Hogan added. Regulators need to work together with the regional banking industry to find policy options that will help bring back consumer confidence and stability to the financial system, said Lindsay Johnson, president and chief executive of retail banking lobby group Consumer Bankers Association, in a speech at the Exchequer Club of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. ""We call on policymakers to join our industry in helping to reinstall consumers' confidence in our financial system and stability across the marketplace,"" Johnson said. Regional banks, the largest lenders to the beleaguered U.S. commercial real estate and construction markets, have reduced their exposure to the sector by tightening standards and making fewer loans, according to a Reuters analysis. Many real estate borrowers face challenges making interest payments in a rising rate environment, while office use declined during the pandemic and property values have decreased on recession concerns. Deposit flows at U.S. banks, including regional lenders, climbed to $17.16 trillion in the week ended May 3, marking the first increase in four weeks, according to Federal Reserve data. First Republic Bank's former Chief Executive Michael Roffler blamed the bank's collapse on contagion from the failures of other regional banks and said regulators did not express concerns regarding the bank's strategy, liquidity or management performance. A total of over $100 billion in deposits were withdrawn from the bank in recent weeks, a time of industry-wide panic about soundness of regional banks, Roffler said in prepared testimony to be delivered at a U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services sub-committee hearing.

Downtown Fort Worth Office Vacancy is 11.5% - The Real Deal,Downtown Fort Worth Office Vacancy is 11.5%  The Real Deal,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 21:26:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL3RleGFzL2RhbGxhcy8yMDI0LzA0LzE1L2Rvd250b3duLWZvcnQtd29ydGgtb2ZmaWNlLXZhY2FuY3ktaXMtMTEtNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Real Deal,"It’s going to be an exciting year for JLL’s Geoff Shelton. He’s responsible for leasing up one of Fort Worth’s rarest resources: new Class A office space. The firm has been tapped by Nebraska-based developer Goldenrod Companies, which is putting its stamp on Fort Worth in the form of two mixed-use projects in the city’s Cultural District. Between One University and the Van Zandt, Goldenrod is expected to add 218,000 square feet of office space to the market by the end of 2026. Since companies have struggled to make working in the office more appealing than working from home, the latest office movement trend is “flight to quality.” But in Fort Worth, that means “a very focused flight to neighborhood … where tenants have gravitated toward certain neighborhoods that have these quality new assets,” Shelton said. Not only are tenants seeking out premium office space; they’re also looking to be surrounded by amenities, like restaurants and luxury hotels. Right now, those hot neighborhoods are: West Bend, Clearfork and the Cultural District. In less than a decade, more than a billion dollars has been invested in the area just west of downtown Fort Worth that includes Dickies arena, the city’s museums and nightlife destinations. In 2023, Dallas-based Crescent Real Estate opened a $275 million mixed-use development whose offices are already mostly leased. Next door, luxury hotel brand Auberge Resorts Collection opened the Bowie House hotel in December. “It’s kind of our Uptown Dallas,” Shelton said. Healthy fundamentals Amid warning cries of the office apocalypse, Fort Worth’s market is writing a different narrative. Downtowns across the country are grappling with high office vacancy, but that’s not the case for Fort Worth’s central business district. It has a vacancy rate of just 11.5 percent, Partners’ Steve Triolet said. Thirty miles away on Interstate 30, downtown Dallas’ vacancy rate is 26.4 percent. Plus, the sublease market makes up just half of a percent of the vacancy in Fort Worth’s CBD. Fort Worth is also seeing rent increases. The city’s central business district saw a 10 percent jump in rents between the first quarter of this year and the first quarter of last year. Triolet attributes that in part to the fact that downtown property is largely owned by a few entities, like the billionaire Bass family. Less competition gives landlords a bit more control. If all goes according to plan, the forthcoming Goldenrod properties will help prop up the city’s rent numbers. Goldenrod is expecting to lease space at Van Zandt at $48 per square foot triple-net, and $52 per square foot at One University, Shelton said. The two sides of low inventory When companies relocate to Dallas-Fort Worth, more often than not, they’re looking for new product or offices built to suit. The Goldenrod projects will certainly make a splash, but they’re pretty much on their own when it comes to new upscale office space in Fort Worth. “There’s really not much coming in the grand scheme,” Triolet said. For its strong fundamentals, downtown Fort Worth’s absorption is “kind of quiet,” he said. In the first quarter of this year, the city’s CBD saw 1,000 square feet of positive absorption, which Triolet called “basically a rounding error.” That’s why Shelton doesn’t think that these two developments will be just flash-in-the-pan successes. Take the Stack over in Dallas’ Deep Ellum neighborhood. That highly anticipated project from Hines, Westdale Real Estate Investments and Management, and Ivanhoe Cambridge was fully leased one year after delivery; now, more than a third of the building is on the sublease market. To Shelton, Fort Worth’s low inventory makes this kind of outcome unlikely. “We’re essentially starting with a blank canvas of new delivery,” he said. Betting on Fort Worth Goldenrod isn’t the only developer betting on demand for premium office space in Fort Worth.

S&P 500 slumps as SVB Financial shutdown stokes bank contagion fears - Yahoo Movies UK,S&P 500 slumps as SVB Financial shutdown stokes bank contagion fears  Yahoo Movies UK,"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 19:14:35 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvcC01MDAtc2x1bXBzLXN2Yi1maW5hbmNpYWwtMTQyNjQ0MDkwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Movies UK,"By Yasin Ebrahim Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slumped Friday, amid fears of contagion that swept through banking stocks as regulators closed SVB Financial to protect deposits after the beleaguered bank's effort to secure funding failed. The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%, or 333 points, the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.8%. SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) was closed by regulators and its deposits placed under control of regulators to protect depositors. The news sparked widespread fears of a spillover into the broader banking sector, with regional banks, which tend to have less diversified funding sources than their larger peers, in the firing line. Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) and First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) were down more than 18%, while JPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo &Company (NYSE:WFC) were in the green amid expectations that depositors will seek safety in larger banks. The turmoil in banks triggering worries about a systematic banking crisis forced investors to rethink their bets on larger rate hikes at the Federal Reserve’s March meeting even as job gains in February topped estimates. The U.S. economy created 311,000 jobs last month, well above expectations, though there were some signs of softening in the labor market including a tick up in the unemployment rate and slower wage growth. “It is hard to say that cracks are forming in the labor market when payrolls increase 311k, but it seems like we are at least at the ""beginning of the beginning"" of the process of seeing the labor market soften,” Jefferies said in a note. Investors reined in the bets on a 50 basis points rate hike in March to 50% from about 80% a day earlier, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Treasury yields, which had jumped to their highest level in more than a decade earlier this week, fell sharply, helping the broader market pare some losses. On the earnings front, DocuSign's (NASDAQ:DOCU) better-than-expected quarterly results were overshadowed by an announcement that its chief financial officer Cynthia Gaylor would step down later this year. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), meanwhile, reported mixed fourth-quarter results as revenue missed Wall Street expectations, sending the stock more than 3% lower. Following the results, Goldman Sachs reiterated its sell rating on Oracle amid worries about market share losses in the database market, expectations for a slowdown in subscription services revenue and the impact of capital expenditure pressure on margins. Elsewhere Gap (NYSE:GPS) reported a wider quarterly loss and guidance which fell short of Wall Street estimates. Credit Suisse described the guidance from the retailer as “sobering,” but said there was “less risk of further downward revisions beyond the initial guidance.” Related Articles",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,2023-03-10,-0.112,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'DocuSign', 'description': 'United States company', 'full_name': 'DocuSign', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/DocuSignHeadquarters.jpg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Republic Bank', 'latitude': 11.180520057678223, 'longitude': -60.73405075073242, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'NYSE', 'latitude': 1.065369963645935, 'longitude': 13.047080039978027, 'location_type': 'LANDMARK'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Company', 'latitude': 5.2648701667785645, 'longitude': 10.22821044921875, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'U.S.', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Wall Street', 'latitude': 37.61832046508789, 'longitude': -112.16436004638672, 'location_type': 'UNDETERMINED'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Oracle', 'latitude': 32.61090850830078, 'longitude': -110.77092742919922, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Suisse', 'latitude': 47.000160217285156, 'longitude': 8.014269828796387, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}]",Not directly related,"- First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) was down more than 18% amid fears of contagion from the closure of SVB Financial.

Pakistan Court Stays Arrest Warrant Against Ex-PM Imran Khan - Yahoo Movies UK,Pakistan Court Stays Arrest Warrant Against Ex-PM Imran Khan  Yahoo Movies UK,"Sun, 14 Apr 2024 10:34:21 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvcGFraXN0YW4tY291cnQtYWdhaW4taGFsdHMtcG9saWNlLTA4MzM1OTA3OS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Yahoo Movies UK,"(Bloomberg) -- A Pakistan court has dismissed the petition of former Prime Minister Imran Khan seeking suspension of his arrest warrant, after violent clashes near his home this week prevented security officials from detaining him. Most Read from Bloomberg “The judgment means Khan can be arrested now,” his lawyer, Sher Afzal Marwat, told reporters outside a district court in Islamabad. The court rejected Khan’s petition on the grounds that it was “not justified by law as well as fact.” Thursday’s development comes hours after the Lahore High Court suspended any further police action against Khan until Friday. The former cricket star is facing multiple court cases, which he says are politically motivated and designed to keep him out of elections later this year. Khan plans to challenge the verdict in a higher court, his aide, Shibli Faraz, said. The former prime minister has told the court he will appear on March 18. For two days, security forces and Khan’s supporters have clashed near his home in the city of Lahore. Police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse crowds trying to block the former prime minister’s arrest. The street battles and legal tussles to bring Khan to court have threatened to overshadow the country’s economic crisis. Pakistan’s dollar bonds due 2024 were indicated inching 0.1 cents higher to 42.1 cents on the dollar, after tumbling by the most since September on Wednesday. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has denied that the court cases are related to elections, saying his focus is on securing loans from the International Monetary Fund to help Pakistan avoid a default. While speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he dismissed any suggestion that political friction is causing delays in reviving the bailout program. “We have accepted all the conditions - very tough conditions set by the IMF,” Sharif said when asked about the delay in the deal. “I hope the staff level agreement will be signed very soon and it will be sent to the IMF board.” Sharif has rejected Khan’s demands to hold snap polls and has said elections will be held from September and October onwards as he wants to focus on the economy first. Khan has said the court cases filed against him are a move to silence him and break his popularity. The latest arrest warrant, issued last week, is in relation to allegations that Khan failed to disclose funds obtained from the sale of state gifts when he was in power. Khan has denied wrongdoing. Most Popular Despite the dozens of court cases leveled against Khan, he remains the most popular politician in Pakistan, according to an opinion survey published last week. His rallies draw tens of thousands of people at any one time, but Khan has said he faces threats to his life and the court cases expose him further. Khan has been largely confined to his home in Lahore since he was shot and wounded in the leg during a rally in November. He has asked that all the court hearings be carried out in a high-security judicial complex in Islamabad. Prime Minister Sharif has become deeply unpopular among voters, who blame his coalition for the nation’s economic crisis. The Pakistani rupee has plummeted to new lows and inflation is hovering at a record high. His government has been forced to raise energy prices and taxes as it races to meet conditions to revive a loan with the IMF. They need to avoid a default that can make borrowing costs higher and cut off market access to credit. --With assistance from Ismail Dilawar and Khalid Qayum.

Bay Area Landlords Sue FDIC Over First Republic Bank Leases - The Real Deal,Bay Area Landlords Sue FDIC Over First Republic Bank Leases  The Real Deal,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 21:07:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby8yMDI0LzA0LzE1L2JheS1hcmVhLWxhbmRsb3Jkcy1zdWUtZmRpYy1vdmVyLWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLWJhbmstbGVhc2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Real Deal,"Bay Area office landlords have filed separate lawsuits against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, accusing the agency of giving lowball offers to settle unpaid rent claims against shuttered lender First Republic Bank. The three lawsuits, which involve rejected First Republic leases in Walnut Creek, Noe Valley and Greenbrae, outline claims of $48.3 million in unpaid rent. Out of that total, the FDIC only approved payouts totaling nearly $1.5 million. The FDIC was appointed as the receiver of the failed bank in May 2023. The closure was the second-largest bank collapse in the history of the United States, behind the failure of Washington Mutual in 2008. J.P. Morgan acquired First Republic Bank through an auction in April last year. The biggest claim relates to California Plaza, a 10-story office building in Walnut Creek. First Republic signed an 88,000-square-foot lease at the property, located at 2121 North California Boulevard, in March 2022, court records show. That transaction was one of the largest lease deals in Walnut Creek for the second quarter of 2022, according to a report from Colliers. In its complaint, the owner of California Plaza, an entity managed by commercial brokerage Newmark Knight Frank, claims that the FDIC took more than seven months to repudiate the lease. The plaintiff claims that this “unreasonable delay” led to “lost opportunities to lease the premises to other tenants.” In September, Newmark submitted a claim of $47 million. It also claimed that “at a minimum,” it is entitled to $3.9 million in unpaid rent dating to when the lease was repudiated in December 2023. In response, the FDIC approved a $1.4 million payment, or 3 percent of the claim. According to the complaint, the FDIC stopped paying rent in August 2023 and First Republic has yet to vacate the property. One of the other cases against the FDIC relates to 505 Sir Francis Drake Boulevard in Greenbrae, a low-slung standalone office buildling. An entity managed by investor Soheyla Hifai claims she is owed $1.3 million. The FDIC only allowed a $23,000 portion of her claim. Meanwhile, Noe Valley LLC, which owns 3936 and 3938 24th Street in Noe Valley, said that it is owed $500,000 in unpaid rent and construction costs for the retail location. The FDIC approved a payment of $6,239. First Republic Bank will cease to exist on May 24, with its remaining 62 branches across the country set to close. The closures will include 25 locations in the Bay Area. The FDIC declined to comment.",https://static.therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SFO-FDIC-sued-over-rejected-First-Republic-Bank-leases-in-SF-FEATUREIMG_v2.jpg,2024-04-15,-0.571,"[{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Washington Mutual', 'description': 'former American bank holding company', 'full_name': 'Washington Mutual', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Washington_Mutual_Tower%2C_Seattle%2C_August_2006.jpg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'J.P.

The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had sparked a crisis of confidence in the banking sector, leading to a run on deposits at a host of regional banks despite U.S. authorities launching emergency measures to shore up confidence. Earlier on Tuesday, S&P Global Ratings placed First Republic Bank on CreditWatch negative, reflecting lower confidence in the lender's financial strength. However, later in the day, S&P said it had not seen evidence that the unmanageable deposit outflows seen at a few banks had widely spread across the banks it covers. S&P said U.S. regulators' measures gave banks additional liquidity, although the ratings agency cautioned that conditions were fluid and that some banks were showing greater signs of stress than others. Moody's Investors Service revised its outlook on the U.S. banking system to ""negative"" from ""stable"" earlier on Tuesday to reflect the rapid deterioration in the operating environment. However, Ron O'Hanley, the chief executive officer of asset manager State Street Corp, said on Wednesday that Moody's outlook cut was ""a terrible overreaction."" The regulators had reassured markets, O'Hanley said in a Bloomberg News interview.

Below is a look at First Republic Bank’s CD rates. Note that the rates offered can vary by location. The CD rates included in the chart below are based on the Florida region. First Republic Bank CD Details When selecting the right CD for your situation, it’s critical to read the fine print. Without a close look at the fine print, it’s impossible to know exactly what you are getting yourself into. Here’s what you should know: Minimum opening deposit: You’ll need to deposit at least $10,000 to open a CD with this financial institution. Compounding schedule: Daily Early withdrawal penalties: For terms of up to one year, you’ll pay a penalty worth 180 days of interest if you need to access your funds early. For terms of more than one year, you’ll pay a penalty worth 450 days of interest if you need to withdraw your funds before the maturity date. Grace period: After the CD matures, First Republic Bank will automatically roll your funds into a new CD. But you’ll have 10 days to make a penalty-free withdrawal of the funds. The standout detail of First Republic Bank’s CDs is the minimum opening deposit requirement. You’ll need at least $10,000 to open a CD with this bank, which is a hefty requirement. Many banks don’t require an opening deposit close to this large. How Much You Can Earn As you explore your CD options with First Republic and other financial institutions, it’s helpful to see how much you can earn through a CD term. The amount you can earn varies based on the CD term you choose, the APY you snag, and the amount of money you lock into the CD. The table below highlights what you could earn through First Republic’s CDs with various deposit amounts. How To Open a First Republic Bank CD If you want to open a CD with First Republic Bank, you can do so by calling the bank or visiting a physical branch. The bank has locations in California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. You can also fill out an online form with your contact information and request for the bank to contact you. How First Republic Bank CDs Compare When it comes to opening a CD, annual percentage yields should play a big role in your decision-making process. A higher APY means you’ll have the opportunity to earn more interest from that CD than one with a lower APY. Of course, most savers want to get the most bang for their buck, which means locking in a CD with a top rate. Overall, First Republic Bank’s CD rates are less than competitive with top options. While the bank offers a few standout rates, like the 4.75% APY for a nine-month term, that’s not enough to make all of First Republic Bank’s CD offerings competitive. Not surprisingly, online banks tend to offer the highest APYs for CDs. Since online banks have more limited expenses than banks with brick-and-mortar locations, online banks are usually able to offer more value to savers.
