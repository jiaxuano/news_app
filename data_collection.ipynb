      "{'title': 'The Harbor Bank of Maryland Partners with Account Onboarding Specialist Prelim', 'text': 'The Harbor Bank of Maryland has partnered with digital account onboarding specialist Prelim. Courtesy of the partnership, the Baltimore, Maryland-based financial institution will leverage Prelim’s technology and expertise to enhance its account opening services. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Prelim made its Finovate debut at FinovateSpring 2022. Digital account onboarding specialist Prelim and the Harbor Bank of Maryland have teamed up to bring digital account opening services to the customers of the Baltimore, Maryland-based financial institution. Founded in 1982 with $2.1 million in assets, Harbor Bank of Maryland serves the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area with seven branch locations and a loan office in Silver Spring, Maryland. The bank offers a wide variety of banking services, including checking, savings, time deposits, credit and debit cards, and commercial real estate, as well as personal, home improvement, and other installment and term loans. With total assets of $377 million, Harbor Bank of Maryland is a designated Minority Depository Institution (MDI) and the first community bank in the U.S. to have an investment subsidiary, Harbor Financial Services. San Francisco, California-based Prelim made its Finovate debut at FinovateSpring in 2022 and returned again the following year for FinovateSpring 2023. Co-founded in 2017 by Heang Chan (CEO) and Chris Blaser (CTO), Prelim offers a white-label platform that empowers banks to digitize their business banking operations. Via API, Prelim enables financial institutions to automate their business account onboarding, as well as connect to third party providers to meet AML, BSA, and CIP requirements. The platform also helps FIs launch other financial services and banking products from lending to merchant services. In addition to its partnership with the Harbor Bank of Maryland, Prelim last month announced a collaboration with Movement Bank. Headquartered in Danville, Virginia, Movement Bank was launched in 1919 by a team of African American doctors, teachers, farmers, and preachers. From humble origins in a church basement and $6,500 in capital, the financial institution has grown into a major community resource. The bank was among the first to reopen during the Great Depression after banks were forced to close. The institution was also one of the first banks in Virginia to issue Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans back in 1934. Movement Bank currently has $150 million in total assets.

      "{'title': 'A Slower Economy, Lower Inflation; The Odds Of A June Rate Cut Are Significant', 'text': 'Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin During the last week in March, there were several significant foreclosures (hundreds of millions of dollars per property). They included properties in San Francisco and Mountain View, CA, a large complex in Washington, D.C., and a medical office building (still under construction) in the southern part of Florida. YoY Change in National Rent Index (2019-Present) Apartment List Leveraged loan delinquencies now exceed 6% (normal is <3%). This level is approaching the levels seen in the ’01, ’08, and ’20 Recessions. According to Moody’s, office vacancies are at record highs. Commercial Real Estate (CRE) prices are in freefall. According to Rosenberg Research, 29% of all CRE, and 56% of office loans now have negative equity. Retail malls are struggling, and the multi-family space is overbuilt (falling rents). It will be informative to see the additions to their loan loss reserves as banks post their Q1 results in April. Equity Markets Yet, despite the growing problems in the CRE sector and cracks appearing in the economic landscape, equity prices continue to scale new heights. The S&P 500 and the DJIA both hit record closing highs on Thursday (March 28), with the Nasdaq a hair’s breadth away from its record closing high of March 22nd. The equity market continues to be driven by momentum, and traditional valuation metrics, like the PE (Price/Earnings) Ratio are significantly above their median values (see chart below). PE Ratio for S&P 500: 29.00 Gurufocus Cracks in the Foundation Meanwhile, over the past quarter or so, we’ve seen flat to falling Industrial Production, lower retail sales volumes, shrinking exports, flat to negative capital spending, and a net loss of full-time jobs (being replaced by part-time ones). Yet, in the face of this data, both the Atlanta and St. Louis Federal Reserve District Banks are forecasting a stunning +2.3% growth rate for Q1 GDP. This appears to be extremely optimistic. In addition, the media is still touting “the economy is strong” mantra. We think the growth is much lower, as do many research houses. Rosenberg Research, for example, is projecting -0.5% Q1 GDP growth based on the trends in the following data over the past three months: MORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR Best Tax Software Of 2022 Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022 Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes Industrial Production (-2,7% Annual Rate (AR AR )) Retail Sales volume (-5.3% AR) Core CORE Capex Orders (-0.9% AR) Exports (-1.1% AR) Full-Time employment (-5.2% AR) In addition, Rosenberg reports that same store sale have contracted in dollar terms (-0.2% year over year). Worse, when adjusted for inflation (i.e. looking at volumes), that number becomes a negative (-1.3%) and has been negative for five quarters in a row. That was last seen in the Great Recession (see chart below). Furthermore, if we look at Wall Street’s earnings growth estimates for Q2, these are flat as a pancake, and we have the major retailers (TGT, HD, LOW, WMT) all commenting in their Q4 earnings calls that consumers have tightened their purse strings. The latest retail reports from the likes of Lululemon and Nike NKE were also downbeat as both reported disappointing sales, softening demand, and slower traffic. Volume Growth at Consumer Businesses Bloomberg, Rosenberg Research In past blogs, we’ve commented on the rapid rise in credit card balances. That’s because personal savings have been depleted. And now we are seeing rapidly rising credit card, auto loan, and other consumer loan delinquencies. Consumer Loans: Delinquency Rate Universal Value Advisors Home Prices and the “Wealth Effect” Rising home prices often lead to what economists call the “wealth effect.” That is, when home prices rise, homeowners tend to spend more because they feel they can afford higher consumption as their “wealth” is higher. That particular effect is now waning. Both the Case-Shiller and the FHFA Home Price Indexes are displaying steep negative slopes with the FHFA Index already in negative territory. The housing boom may very well be ending. S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index; FHFA House Price Index Universal Value Advisors The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell in March with the Future Expectations sub-index now at a six-month low. Less than 15% of those surveyed see the economy improving in the next six-months, while plans to purchase a car or major home appliance were the weakest since July ’22, and September ’11 before that. Growth Forecasts While the mothership Fed recently raised its GDP growth forecast for 2024 from 1.4% to 2.1% and lowered its U3 Unemployment Level at year’s end to 4.0% from 4.1%, reports from the Fed’s Regional District Banks aren’t as sanguine. The Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing Index showed up as -14.4 in March, even lower than February’s -11.3. Production, New Orders, and Shipments were negative and the workweek contracted. The Dallas Fed’s Services Index was also weak at -5.0; again lower than in February (-3.9). The Philly Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index, at -18.3 in March, has now shown contraction for three months in a row. New Orders, Backlogs, and Inventories all shrank. And full-time job growth was the lowest since last June. The Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index was also negative in March (-11), and, again, worse than the -5 reading in February. This marked the sixth month in a row of contraction. Negatives were seen in in the indexes for New Orders, Capacity Utilization, and Backlogs. In addition, Business Spending was the most contractionary since July ’20. The chart shows the Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index. This comprehensive index has been in negative terrain since Q4 ’22. Chicago Fed National Activity Index Universal Value Advisors The Fed and Interest Rates Chairman Powell and other FOMC members continue to insist that they need to see more “good” inflation data before embarking on a lowering rate agenda. We had some bumps in the road on the disinflation path in January and February. At his recent press conference after the Fed’s latest meeting, the Chairman eased market angst, saying that the Fed would not overreact to the hotter than anticipated January and February inflation data. On Friday (March 29th), the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index (PCE) printed a +0.3% number (+0.332% to the third decimal), down slightly from January’s +0.4% (+0.376%). Nevertheless, due to “base effects,” the year over year rate (2.45%) ticked up slightly from January’s 2.43%, the first uptick in quite some time, but ever so slight. As inflation falls to target, statistically, such deviations can be expected. The core PCE measure, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, also rose 0.3% in February, and 2.8% on the year over year measure, down slightly from 2.9% in January. The PCE report won’t do anything to change FOMC views that the last part of the inflation fight will take a little longer. As seen from the chart below, the Core PCE Price Deflator is lower than the Core CPI Index. That’s good news as that is the index to which the Fed reacts. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index Yahoo! Finance On Friday (April 5th), the CPI for March will be announced. As we have discussed in past blogs, our view is that the lagged shelter component in the CPI will be de-escalating the annual rate of CPI inflation through year’s end. Markets apparently agree with this assessment, as the odds of a June rate cut have now climbed to as high as 70%. The June 11-12 Fed meeting is still nearly two and a half months away. A lot can and will happen in this interim. Final Thoughts CRE issues are mounting, and foreclosures are in their early stages. We expect large impacts on the financial sector over the next several months. This alone will throw the economy into Recession. Banks’ loan loss provisions in their upcoming Q1 financial reports will shed a lot of light on this topic. Despite growing cracks in the economy, the equities market continues to hit record high closing prices. Traditional valuation metrics strongly suggest that equities are in overvaluation territory. Cracks in non-financial sectors also continue to appear. Manufacturing looks to already be in Recession, and the Consumer, who has driven this economy for the last several quarters, appears to now be out of gas. While the Fed recently raised its 2024 GDP forecast and lowed its year end unemployment rate prediction, emerging data show weakening retail sales, production and housing. The Regional Fed Bank surveys suggest the same. Despite the January/February upticks, all the other measures continue to show disinflation (slowing rates of inflation). Instead of the “bumps in the road” making Fed Chair Powell more hawkish, he surprised markets at his recent press conference by assuring them that the inflation fight was being won. We agree with that assessment. Due to the lag in shelter data built into the CPI, significantly lower inflation (i.e., disinflation) is all but guaranteed. Thus, the odds of a June rate cut now appear to be significant. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.) Follow me on Twitter. Check out my website.

      "{'title': 'Surviving High Interest Rates In The Real Estate Industry', 'text': \"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Zain Jaffer is the founder and president of Zain Ventures, a family office that invests in real estate and proptech. getty In late January 2024, four U.S. Senators, namely Elizabeth Warren, John Hickenlooper, Jacky Rosen and Sheldon Whitehouse, wrote to U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell urging him to cut interest rates. “As the Fed weighs its next steps in the new year, we urge you to consider the effects of your interest rate decisions on the housing market,” the senators wrote. “The direct effect of these astronomical rates has been a significant increase in the overall home purchasing cost to the average consumer,” they added. The U.S. housing market is virtually frozen, save for a few buyers and sellers who absolutely need to buy or sell and move elsewhere for various personal reasons. Although mortgage rates in early January lowered a bit to around 6.7%, the average rate reached as high as 7.8% in mid-October 2023. In November 2020, it was around 2.7%, which is a difference of around 5%. The problem is that inflation is not yet under the Fed's target 2% goal. In 2020, it was around 1.2%, but the cash infusion into the economy during the pandemic helped push it to 8% in 2022. Not making debt expensive through rate hikes would have meant risking hyperinflation, which could have serious consequences. The Fed has two tools to fight it: Quantitative tightening means that they no longer buy treasury bonds and bills and mortgage backed securities (MBS) from banks so in effect they have less cash to lend out, and higher interest rates, meaning the banks need to raise the lending rate to their clients because the money they borrow from the Fed is now more expensive. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor How are high interest rates affecting the real estate sector? To say that high interest rates have decimated the real estate sector is an understatement. Many real estate projects are financed largely with debt, with just a little equity from the developer. The housing market is negatively impacted, but so is office and retail commercial real estate space, particularly in large cities where there is a lot of competition. Although Class A properties are still doing relatively okay because big companies and high-end professional offices want slick, cool office spaces to entice their workforce and impress their clients, I've noticed the older non-ESG-compliant office buildings are not doing so well. Many workers prefer to work from home (WFH), assuming they have not been laid off because of poor economic conditions or that artificial intelligence (AI) hasn’t replaced them yet. On the bright side, parking lots and warehouses are still doing okay, especially since online retail is quite popular. The situation is so bad that I hear of established developers doing a firesale on their offices in places like San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles just to offload some of these properties off their books. They realize that at high interest rates, the math on these investments no longer works. Then there is also the mountain of corporate debt that had originally been lent at low interest rates to companies for their operations and capex prior to the Fed hikes. Many companies are already struggling to meet their monthly payments, and now, with their loans maturing, they need to renegotiate with their bank or lender at higher rates. For some of them, they will need to throw in the towel if expected inflows will not meet contractual outflow needs. For businesses, the goal is to survive. At this point, the question is no longer how to make lots of money for some businesses. For many, their goal right now is to simply survive until the interest rates go lower, when they feel they can pay off the new renegotiated loans with what they predict will lower cash inflows or revenues to their businesses. If you are running a business, you may have talked to your banker about renegotiating your loan so that you do not miss payments. This may mean adding more years to the repayment period, but the alternative is to default on the loan—within reason, of course. If the project no longer makes sense, such as an office project that is mostly vacant, you may need to find a buyer for the property or turn that business into something else. Aside from talking to your banker (or lender) about restructuring your debt to be easier to service, you also need to go all out on your sales efforts. This is the time for creative marketing strategies and for your sales team to really hit and exceed their quotas. Making sure your debt servicing can be met with your inflows is essential for making it through. Surviving to fight for another day is not just a saying for you. It is what you need to do.

      "{'title': 'Regional banks face big hurdles a year after SVB collapse', 'text': 'By Ann Saphir, Saeed Azhar and Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) - U.S. regional lenders face ongoing challenges from rising deposit costs and risky office-building loans a year after the biggest bank failures since 2008. The unexpected collapses of three banks - Silicon Valley and Signature in March 2023 and First Republic in May - put a spotlight on how lenders managed risks to assets and liquidity as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to bring surging inflation under control. Now that the Fed has stopped raising rates but has signaled cuts may not come for another several months, investors have shifted their focus to the potential for customers to pull their deposits in times of stress, while gauging lenders\\' exposure to the troubled commercial real estate (CRE) sector. \"The banking industry needs to make sure it has a strong hold on its access to liquidity, conduct in-depth deposit stress testing, and ensure it can withstand significant stress,\" said Ryan Nash, banking analyst at Goldman Sachs. \"This is something that all banks will need to plan for in the world ahead.” The tumult prompted emergency government measures to stabilize the sector alongside downgrades by credit rating agencies. In recent weeks, New York Community Bancorp has fueled market jitters about renewed weakness in the sector after it disclosed major losses and warned of material weakness in its internal controls. \"Last year’s bank stress underscores the importance of not becoming complacent,\" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in New York City last week, noting that the bank failures were due not just to poor risk management but also to weaknesses in supervision. The following graphics show the impact of Silicon Valley Bank\\'s (SVB) collapse on the industry, one year after its March 10 failure. In its immediate aftermath, business lending plunged and banks pulled back on credit more broadly. In recent months, both measures have improved, but are still below year-ago levels. Commercial lending has bumped along in recent months, barely regaining lost ground after SVB\\'s failure. Regional banks have relatively large exposure to CRE loans, compared with larger peers that have more diversified portfolios. Lenders are under pressure to write down their losses from CRE as offices remain sparsely populated by workers on hybrid or remote work arrangements. Growth in CRE lending slowed dramatically after SVB\\'s failure and continued to decelerate through the year. Loans by regional and community banks, which account for the bulk of CRE lending, are still above last year, but the biggest banks have trimmed their CRE loan portfolios. Recent Boston Fed research suggests that, even so, it may be the biggest banks that are more vulnerable to CRE losses, with 40% of their office building loans in counties with a high share of work-from home, versus 30% for smaller banks. The turmoil of March 2023 triggered \"stress for most, crisis for a few\" banks, said Christopher Wolfe, head of North American Banks ratings at Fitch. It highlighted the importance of banks maintaining solid insured and operational deposits to underpin their funding. \"The banks most caught out were material outliers,\" in terms of their sources of deposits, he said. Depositors fled smaller U.S. lenders for the safety of bigger institutions after SVB failed, but some funds have since flowed back. Overall deposits in banks of all sizes are down compared with a year earlier as households have spent their savings or chased higher returns in money markets or rallying equities. More than 90% of Silicon Valley Bank\\'s deposits were not insured by a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp guarantee, which covers at least $250,000 in deposit accounts. SVB\\'s uninsured deposits stood at twice the average of its peers. It was toppled after clients who were concerned about the bank\\'s health pulled their money, regulators found. Since last year, the proportion of uninsured deposits in the industry has declined, FDIC data shows. \"When your customer deposit base is making big withdrawals over the short term, it will definitely cause a liquidity squeeze,\" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at Argus Research. \"No amount of capital levels will be able to save a bank that has 40% of their deposits leave in 24-48 hours.\" Investors generally expect regional bank stocks to be more volatile than stocks of bigger banks and larger financial institutions. For this reason, there tends to be a gap between the implied volatility of regional stocks and larger banks. This gap, which widened sharply during the March turmoil, has not gone back to pre-crisis levels. The spread reflects investors\\' lingering perception that regional banks are a less safe bet than bigger lenders. \"The risks facing regional banks right now would be an environment of higher-for-longer rates,\" said Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer of Treasury Partners. As banks pay more to retain customer deposits, the money they earn from interest payments is eroded, he said, referring to a measure called net interest margin. Saperstein expects more banks to set aside reserves for potential losses on CRE loans, particularly related to offices. He also predicts ratings agencies will continue to downgrade regional lenders. Regional banks in particular saw a decline in net interest income as they had to pay more to depositors versus larger peers while demand from borrowers stays subdued. The stocks of regional lenders were hit when SVB\\'s troubles first emerged, and have lagged the overall U.S. equity market over the past year. The KBW Regional Banking index has slumped roughly 12% since the banking issues first flared in March 2023, while the S&P 500 - the benchmark for the U.S. stock market - has gained 28% in that time, fueled by huge gains for megacap technology and growth stocks. The S&P 500 banks index, which includes major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, has fared better, rising some 12% over the past year, though still trailing the overall S&P 500.

And according to a report Tuesday (March 12) by Bloomberg News, that collapse brought with it the largest penalty since before the 2008 financial crisis: $285 million in fees to retire emergency financing the lender had gotten from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system. The report, citing an internal Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) document obtained by Bloomberg, said that SVB had received billions in financing in an eleventh-hour effort to withstand the run on deposits that led to its seizure by regulators. The FHLB system was established during the Great Depression to back mortgage lending. In addition to SVB, two other lenders that went out of business last year — Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank — had also borrowed billions from the program. SVB and Signature both collapsed within days of each other last March, the same week that saw Silvergate voluntarily close its doors. Elliot Sloane, a spokesman for the San Francisco FHLB, which floated the money to SVB, told Bloomberg the bank “worked diligently and urgently to provide critical liquidity to Silicon Valley Bank in the days prior to its failure.” When SVB went under, the FHLB was within its rights to recall its money but chose not to do so, said Sloane. Instead, the bridge bank that took over SVB moved to repay the advances early and take on the cost laid out in the contract, thus getting full control of SVB’s assets that had been pledged as collateral to the home-loan bank. Marking the one-year anniversary of the SVB collapse earlier this week, PYMNTS wrote that the lessons of its failure extend beyond the world of regional banking. “In a fundamental shift in the corporate world, a dozen CFOs noted to PYMNTS in a series of interviews that CFOs are now tasked with managing liquidity levels and cash availability at the board, management and even employee levels,” that report said. “They’ve been crafting bank-risk frameworks and looking toward vendor and third-party risks, where financial supply chains are at least as important as all other business relationships.” What’s not known, that report added, is whether those new measures will be enough. Bank runs look a lot different than they used to, PYMNTS wrote, and the “only certainty is that the banking system will be tested again.”', 'url': 'https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/report-svb-collapse-triggered-record-285-million-penalty/', 'image': 'https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SVB-Silicon-Valley-Bank.jpg', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SVB-Silicon-Valley-Bank.jpg?w=620', 'width': 1000, 'height': 600}, {'url': 'https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SVB-Silicon-Valley-Bank.jpg'}], 'publish_date': '2024-03-12 18:56:22', 'authors': ['PYMNTS'], 'language': 'en', 'sentiment': -0.114, 'entities': [{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bloomberg', 'latitude': -30.700000762939453, 'longitude': 20.583330154418945, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Sloane', 'latitude': -35.91667175292969, 'longitude': 146.01666259765625, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]}\n"

      "{'title': \"Breaking Down the $285 Million Fee Impact in SVB's Emergency Financing Fiasco\", 'text': \"Quiver Quantitative - The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year came with a hefty price tag, not just for the bank itself, but also for the US banking system at large. A crucial yet overlooked aspect of SVB's collapse was the $285 million in fees charged for prematurely ending emergency financing from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system. This fee, necessary to retire billions in financing obtained by SVB in a desperate bid to survive a run on deposits, is the largest of its kind for any bank failure since before the 2008 financial crisis. This situation highlights the significant role of FHLBs in providing emergency lending, even to banks that eventually fail, and brings into focus the ongoing debate in Washington about reforming this Depression-era system initially designed to finance mortgage lending. In the wake of this incident, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the home-loan banks, is considering revising the rules regarding prepayment fees. The rationale behind allowing FHLBs to charge such fees, even from failing borrowers, is to let these institutions recoup the costs associated with retiring the debt, ensuring their financial stability. However, these fees also stoke the debate over the appropriate use of FHLBs in the modern banking landscape, especially concerning their support to struggling banks. The SVB incident, where the FHLB of San Francisco provided $30 billion in emergency financing, underscores the significant reliance of banks on the FHLB system for more than just mortgage financing. Market Overview: -FHLB System Scrutinized: The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) raises questions about the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system's practices, particularly regarding fees charged for early repayment of emergency financing. -Record Fee Charged: A $285 million fee levied against SVB for early repayment is the largest of its kind for a failed bank since before 2006. -Reform Debate Ignited: This incident fuels discussions about potential reforms to the FHLB system, with concerns about profit prioritization over responsible lending practices. -Focus on Core Mission: Consumer advocates urge the FHLB system to return to its original purpose of supporting mortgage lending, rather than acting as a general source of liquidity for failing institutions. Key Points: -Record Fee for FHLB: The $285 million fee charged to SVB for early repayment of emergency financing is the largest on record for a failed bank since at least 2006. -Reform Debate: This incident fuels the debate surrounding FHLB practices, with concerns about the system's prioritization of profit over responsible lending practices. -Prepayment Fee Impact: The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is considering rule changes regarding prepayment fees, aiming to encourage FHLBs to conduct more thorough assessments before offering substantial financing to struggling institutions. -FHLB Defense: The Council of Federal Home Loan Banks argues that these fees compensate the institutions for costs incurred when unwinding financing agreements. -Focus on Core Function: Consumer advocates urge the FHLB system to refocus on its core mission of supporting mortgage lending, rather than serving as a general source of liquidity for failing banks. Looking Ahead: -The FHFA's potential rule changes regarding prepayment fees will be closely monitored to see if they address concerns about FHLB practices. -The broader debate about the FHLB system's role and its adherence to its original mission is likely to continue. SVB's decision to pay back the FHLB financing early, along with the hefty fees, was a critical move in managing the bank's collapse. This action allowed full control of SVB's assets, which had been pledged as collateral to the home-loan bank. Silicon Valley Bank was ultimately acquired by First Citizens BancShares, which continues to use the SVB brand. This scenario is part of a broader trend where numerous banks, amidst last year's financial turmoil, chose to repay their FHLB advances early, incurring penalties. The FHLB system loaned out approximately $676 billion in a single week at the peak of the crisis, demonstrating its vital role in stabilizing the banking industry. The incident with SVB and the subsequent fees charged by FHLB reveal the evolving role of these institutions in the modern financial system. While FHLBs were originally created to support housing finance, their function has expanded significantly, often being utilized as a convenient source of liquidity for financial firms for various purposes. The reliance on FHLBs for emergency funding and the associated penalties in cases of early repayment raise questions about the broader use of these banks and their role in addressing financial crises and housing issues. The debate over FHLB reform and the proper scope of their activities continues to be a pressing issue in the US financial regulatory landscape.\", 'url': 'https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/breaking-down-the-285-million-fee-impact-in-svbs-emergency-financing-fiasco-3334751', 'image': 'https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB2C0AG_L.jpg', 'images': [{'url': 'https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB2C0AG_L.jpg'}, {'url': 'https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB2C0AG_L.jpg'}], 'publish_date': '2024-03-12 17:36:15', 'authors': ['Quiver Quantitative'], 'language': 'en', 'sentiment': 0.154, 'entities': [{'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'description': 'U.S.-based high-tech commercial bank', 'full_name': 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Silicon_Valley_Bank_logo.svg'}, {'type': 'ORG', 'name': 'Focus', 'description': 'non-profit organization in the USA', 'full_name': 'Focus: HOPE'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'SVB', 'latitude': 51.55979919433594, 'longitude': -2.6642000675201416, 'location_type': 'POI'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 42.75035858154297, 'longitude': -71.83702087402344, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Washington', 'latitude': 47.500118255615234, 'longitude': -120.50147247314453, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Council', 'latitude': 37.08039093017578, 'longitude': -82.0684585571289, 'location_type': 'CITY'}]}\n"

      "{'title': 'The Very Elder Statesman', 'text': 'The date was September 22, 1957. Just one week after his landslide reelection to a third term as West Germany’s chancellor, Konrad Adenauer was the guest on CBS’s Face the Nation in a special television broadcast from Germany. The network’s Bonn bureau chief came right out and asked him: “Next January you will be 82 years old. By the time your term has run its course, you will be in your 86th year. Do you really want to continue working at this hard job that long?” Adenauer allowed a faint smile. Through an interpreter, he answered that when Pope Leo XIII turned 90, the dean of the Vatican diplomatic corps had congratulated the pontiff and expressed a wish that he should reach 100. Adenauer, who was Catholic, added, with a twinkle in his eye, “The Pope replied to the dean: ‘But why should you want to set any limits to divine grace?’ I reply the same to you!” The polls today show that many voters regard Joe Biden as too old or enfeebled to serve another four-year term. How can anyone know whether someone that age will be up for the demands of the Oval Office? Yet the life of Konrad Adenauer (1876–1967) proves that a dedicated head of state can not only serve robustly at an advanced age, despite periodic illnesses and public criticism, but can be transformative and make history. Like President Biden, Adenauer was repeatedly accused of senility. He occasionally tumbled in public. His political obituary was written up in the press numerous times. Yet he served in the West German government as an extremely competent head of state, vigorous and active, into his ninth decade. When Adenauer was first elected chancellor of the newly formed Federal Republic of (West) Germany in 1949, he was 73 and widely regarded as a caretaker, too old for lengthy service in office. He even announced before the vote that his doctor had given him the all clear for another two years. Octogenarians who still went to work were far rarer then than today. Adenauer was so old that he had first been a leading candidate for chancellor back in the late 1920s. Yet he ended up being reelected three times (in a 1956 Gallup poll, 75 percent of the electorate “recognized his achievements”) and served until he resigned in the middle of his fourth term in 1963. Age 87 at that time, he continued in office as head of the Christian Democratic Union party until he was 90. The West German public referred to him as Der Alte (roughly, “the old guy”). Der Alte, who had never even traveled to Washington, Rome, or Paris until he was 75, almost single-handedly transformed a bombed-out, impoverished, and reviled rogue nation into a civilized democracy and economic powerhouse, repaired the century-old rift with France, and became the chief architect of the continent’s Euro-federation model that has held firm for 75 years. In an address to the House of Commons on May 11, 1953, Winston Churchill praised Adenauer as “the wisest German statesman since the days of Bismarck.” There are several surprising parallels between Joe Biden and Konrad Adenauer. Both had to overcome chronic impediments from their youth (Biden’s stutter, Adenauer’s weak lungs). Appointed lord mayor of Cologne in 1917, Adenauer was the youngest municipal leader in Prussia, just as Joe Biden at 29 was the youngest U.S. Senator in 1972. Both men were thought to have reached the end of their long political careers in their early 70s, only to reinvent themselves, capture the top job, and embark on dramatic policy innovations. Both men were doubted and ridiculed by the press and their political opponents for being too old and missing a step, though not by pols who worked with them behind closed doors. Both attended Mass regularly while holding the top office. Both men repeatedly overcame devastating emotional setbacks and stayed in the political arena. And like Biden, Adenauer was scarred for life by a terrible automobile accident in his young adult years. Adenauer never learned to drive and preferred his official chauffeurs to drive fast. In mid-March 1917, Adenauer was deputy mayor of Cologne when his driver fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into a streetcar. The impact catapulted Adenauer through the glass partition and shattered his face. Both of his cheekbones and his nose were broken, several teeth were knocked from his jaw, his eyesight was blurred, and he bled profusely from multiple lacerations. Yet he stood up and walked unaided to the hospital, where he was sewn up without anesthetic. This stoic refusal to capitulate to medical setbacks (or political defeats) characterized the rest of his life. At the beginning of October 1923, still mayor of Cologne, Adenauer was hospitalized with appendicitis, a life-threatening illness requiring a long convalescence in those pre-antibiotic days. Only three weeks after the surgery, he was back at his desk dealing with the British and French occupation and crises of public unrest, unemployment, and hyperinflation. The auto accident happened only a few months after Adenauer’s beloved wife Emma, after repeated difficult childbirths, died of kidney problems at only 36. When the lord mayor of Cologne resigned in August 1917, deputy mayor Adenauer was in a sanatorium, still convalescing from his injuries (and no doubt still bereaved). A delegation from Adenauer’s Centre Party visited him to check his eligibility for lord mayor, suspecting that he had sustained a concussion and brain damage. They gave him a challenging two-hour cognitive assessment test, and Adenauer answered everything perfectly. He was elected lord mayor in September and served until Hitler took power in 1933. He was also head of the upper house of the Prussian State parliament from 1921. On February 17, 1933, Adenauer ordered swastika flags be removed from a bridge in Cologne. Soon afterward, the Nazis not only threw him out of the mayoralty but also out of his house, denying him even his salary, pension, and bank account—in part because of his friendly relations with the Jewish business community in Cologne. Having made bad investments and gone bankrupt in the stock market crash not long before, Adenauer was suddenly destitute. Unemployed, and a target for the Reich, he had to keep a low profile, and lived an itinerant life in monasteries and safe houses for several years, supported by a Jewish businessman friend of his, Daniel Heinemann, until his assets were restored to him in 1937. Adenauer had belonged to Pro Palastina, a support group for Jews who wanted to emigrate to Palestine that would ensure “a safe residence” once they got there. Though he never repaid Heinemann’s cash loan, they stayed friends till late in life, and in the early 1950s, Adenauer became the driving force behind West Germany’s reparations payments to Israel, over the objections of some of his cabinet ministers. But after Claus von Stauffenberg plot to assassinate Hitler failed in July 1944, Adenauer was pursued by the Gestapo, though he was uninvolved in the plot. He was briefly imprisoned at a detention camp near Cologne, but managed to escape and elude recapture. The Gestapo arrested his second wife, Gussi, and interrogated her. Under extreme psychological duress, she broke down and revealed where her husband was. The Gestapo found him and reincarcerated him in the same prison where she was held, but kept them separate. Distraught over having revealed her husband’s whereabouts, Gussi tried to commit suicide twice. The Gestapo then released her. Later, Adenauer’s son Max, who had been conscripted into the Wehrmacht, was able to pull strings to get his father out just before he was about to be deported to a death camp. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the Austrian SS leader who was later hanged at Nuremberg, signed off on Adenauer’s release. Gussi Adenauer died at 52 in 1948, partly from medical aftereffects of her suicide attempts. Adenauer never stopped blaming the Nazis for effectively murdering his second wife. A two-time widower, he never remarried and had no intimate companionship for the rest of his long life, apart from the company of his adult daughters on holidays. Adenauer’s own health was affected by his ordeals under the Third Reich. Skeletal after his release from two months in prison, he appeared frail during the immediate postwar aftermath, when food was scarce in Germany and malnutrition widespread. Previously Adenauer had always been disciplined about his health and self-care. Since receiving a false diagnosis of diabetes when he was 29, he had been abstemious in his diet, drinking wine sparingly. After a childhood bout of TB, which had disqualified him from serving in the Prussian Army as a youth, he never smoked or even allowed office personnel in his presence to smoke. In office as chancellor, he made time to take brisk walks. Repeated bouts of pneumonia plagued him throughout his adult life. By the time he was 80, his doctors advised him not to vacation in the mountains anymore because they thought the thinner air would strain his lungs, though he jetted around the globe extensively on diplomatic trips to the end of his chancellorship. He had headaches for years after the car accident, and chronic insomnia (worsened after 1933) led him to take nightly sleeping pills. As Cologne mayor, he had taken a short nap at lunch every working day; as chancellor he extended his daily lunchtime nap to an hour, a practice he shared with Churchill and Lyndon Johnson. Der Alte knew how to pace himself. As the war wound down in the spring of 1945, the American military governor of Cologne restored Adenauer to the mayoralty; the city had been badly damaged by Allied bombing. It was a brief restoration, though: a few months later, the British, who were by now occupying Cologne, summarily fired Adenauer for “incompetence.” It was a public humiliation. He appeared to be finished politically and physically at 70. Somehow, remarkably, Adenauer got a second wind. He organized a new political party, the Christian Democratic Union, to unite the Catholic and Protestant political blocs. “I was born on 5 January 1876, so I am probably the oldest person here,” Adenauer told the room at the first CDU meeting. “If nobody objects, I will regard myself as president by seniority.” By 1949, he had worked his way up to the top job. Who better than someone who had held government office since 1909, through three eras: the pre–WWI Kaiser era, the Allied postwar occupations of the 1920s, and the Allied postwar occupations of the 1940s—and who had survived close calls under the Nazis without collaborating? His almost Olympian calm and dignity were antidotes to the hysteria of Hitler. In 1948, a journalist reported that Adenauer “looked like a wrinkled mummy with a disconcerting capacity for breaking into speech.” His first term in office was quickly interrupted by illness. In July 1950 he came down with pneumonia and took a month off from work. He was reelected by a large margin in 1953 but in October 1955, a month after his diplomatic trip to the Soviet Union, he was bedridden with pneumonia for six weeks. As one of his biographers, Charles Williams, writes, “the mutterings started almost immediately. The Federal Republic, it was widely said, was run by a very sick and very old man; obviously he could not go on. There were long discussions in the press and on the radio about the date of his retirement—or death—and the identity of his successor.” Even Winston Churchill had retired as prime minister at 80. But Adenauer bounced back. In 1957, unknown to the German public and press, he was taking the controversial “fresh cell therapy” anti-aging treatments developed by the surgeon Paul Niehans at the Clinique La Prairie in Montreux, Switzerland, where Pope Pius XII and other world dignitaries had also been treated. Apparently, it helped. He was again reelected. As he got older, Adenauer husbanded his energies by more frequently conducting State business from his second home in a town on Italy’s Lake Como. Yet he still embarked on an arduous world tour in March 1960, enduring a 16-hour flight to New York while riding in the cockpit, and from there traveling to Washington, San Francisco, Hawaii, and Japan. On the return flight to Bonn, he stopped over in Alaska and Iceland. Though he had a bad case of bronchitis in December 1960, he pushed through at work until a public celebration of his 85th birthday seemed to return him to health. Soon enough, he flew to Washington to meet with the newly elected President Kennedy and in April 1961 visited Vice President Johnson’s ranch, where he donned a 10-gallon hat for the cameras. As Adenauer had walked off the airplane and onto the tarmac with Johnson, a TV newsman commented, “He’s 85 years old, and yet he has all the vigor of a man of 50.” Elected a fourth time on November 7, 1961 on the promise that he would resign before the end of his term, Adenauer flew to Washington D.C. for meetings on November 19 despite a fever and a full-blown case of the flu. On December 9, he flew to Paris to meet with Charles de Gaulle. On January 21, 1962, at age 86, Adenauer had a minor heart attack. The public was told he was suffering from a recurrence of influenza. He stayed home in bed for two weeks, but on February 15 he traveled by train to Baden-Baden for another meeting with de Gaulle. One year later in Paris, Adenauer, now 87, and de Gaulle, 72, signed the Élysée Treaty, the Franco-German entente that put an end to centuries of enmity between the two nations. What if Adenauer had been replaced in November 1961 by a younger leader? No younger West German leader had the necessary stature and personal rapport with General de Gaulle to be able to deliver the historic treaty. De Gaulle spoke German, Adenauer some fractured French. They had been meeting one-on-one for years. They had become friends. They were twin icons of their nations’ histories nearing the ends of their lives, and they knew they had to get it right. Throughout his 14 years as chancellor, Adenauer’s political opponents in the Bundestag would try to make fun of his age. In 1958, he tripped and almost fell on the steps to de Gaulle’s house, but 24-hour cable news had not yet been born to record such events. Despite his periodic illnesses, however, Adenauer consistently impressed dignitaries with his youthfulness. In 1953, the former British MP Harold Nicolson, who had met Adenauer in Cologne in 1928, reencountered him and thought he looked “a good twenty years younger.” Prior to Adenauer’s arrival in London for meetings with Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in November 1959, the British political class had gossiped that the West German leader was semi-senile. But after the meetings, Macmillan reported that he was struck by the man’s vitality and that rumors of his senility were nonsense. One of Adenauer’s cabinet ministers, Heinrich Krone, wrote in his diary upon Adenauer’s 87th birthday in 1963: “The Old Man is 87. Fresh, elegant, full of humor, without any sign of weakness. It is not surprising that he does not want to go.” On June 23, 1963, Adenauer rode standing up in an open limousine beside President Kennedy (a man 41 years his junior) through the streets of Cologne. During the Cuban Missile Crisis the previous October, Adenauer had advised Kennedy that he supported the blockade of Cuba, in the belief that the Soviet missiles had been deployed on the island nation to obtain concessions over the then divided city of Berlin. In early 1967, a 91-year-old Adenauer advised private citizen Richard Nixon that Washington should make overtures to Communist China in the hope of “counterbalancing” the Soviet danger. Nixon had met Adenauer many times as vice president and wrote in his book Leaders that he was so impressed by him that he felt that had Adenauer been made chancellor in the late 1920s, there would have been a better chance of Hitler not coming to power. What else did Adenauer accomplish besides weathering multiple bouts of pneumonia, periodic withdrawals, a heart attack, and criticisms of his great age? He reinstituted a free-market economy and opened access to global markets for German industry so rapidly that by 1955, West Germany had become the most powerful economy in Europe. He created social welfare programs, built housing in bombed-out areas, advocated for peaceful nuclear power. He replaced the historically aggressive Prussian face of his nation with a cooperative, integrationist posture, reaching out to such other statesmen as France’s Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman and Belgium’s Paul Henri-Spaak, creating with them the building blocks of a political and economically united Europe: the European Coal and Steel Community; the Common Market; membership in NATO. He ended denazification in the right way, letting ex-Nazis in his government know that if they didn’t toe his liberalizing political line, he would reopen denazification proceedings against them, and he established stringent democratic loyalty tests for ex-Nazis and soldiers in the Bundeswehr (the new armed forces). Though he was autocratic in style, he constructively used that role to gradually transition German citizens away from the custom of an authoritarian leadership to a democratic mode of governance. Above all, he pursued an unwavering alliance with the United States through three U.S. presidencies as a bulwark against possible Soviet aggression not only toward West Germany but to Europe as a whole. He did not succeed in reunifying East and West (that had to wait 25 years), but he set the internationalist template for all the German chancellors who succeeded him. He did all of this as an old man—and largely after his first four-year term. He needed succeeding terms in office to consolidate his achievements, much of which occurred when he was past 80. In Leaders, Nixon recounted an anecdote from his 1970 meeting with Marshal Tito in Belgrade. Tito’s wife told Nixon about a meeting years earlier between her husband and Churchill. Churchill had supposedly looked at her husband and marveled at his youthful appearance. Then Churchill answered his own question: “I know what it is. It’s power. It’s power that keeps a man young.” “When I saw Zhou Enlai in 1972 he was 73; de Gaulle in 1969 was 78; Adenauer in 1959 was 83,” wrote Nixon. “They were still in power because they were stronger and abler than the younger men in their governments. If an older political leader does not suffer from any serious ailments, he will usually make up in wisdom and judgment for what he may lack in stamina, vigor, and mental quickness.” No one can predict the vagaries of old age. Konrad Adenauer himself suffered unpredicted health events after age 82 while still in harness as head of state. Yet no historian I am aware of has ever suggested that Adenauer, infirmities and all, did not remain in full command of his office and his powers till age 87, or that the accomplishments of his later terms were any less consequential because of his age. American voters, pols, and pundits would do well to consider these facts when assessing the fitness of an 82-year-old President Biden as he runs for reelection this year.', 'url': 'https://theamericanscholar.org/the-very-elder-statesman/', 'image': 'https://theamericanscholar.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/adenauer.jpg', 'images': [{'url': 'https://theamericanscholar.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/adenauer.jpg'}, {'url': 'https://theamericanscholar.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/adenauer.jpg'}], 'publish_date': '2024-03-08 05:04:26', 'authors': ['Mark N'], 'language': 'en', 'sentiment': -0.194, 'entities': [{'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Joe Biden', 'description': '46th and current president of the United States', 'full_name': 'Joe Biden', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Joe_Biden_presidential_portrait.jpg'}, {'type': 'PER', 'name': 'Lyndon Johnson', 'description': '36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969', 'full_name': 'Lyndon B.

      "{'title': 'EagleBank CEO Susan Riel On Regional Banking and CRE Lending in 2024', 'text': 'Decades ago, Susan Riel’s husband had a chance to relocate to the West Coast. But Riel wanted to stay within driving distance of her close-knit family of seven siblings in Brooklyn. The resulting compromise has kept the couple in the Washington, D.C., region for 50 years. Twenty-one of those years have been spent at EagleBank, more than five of those now as chief executive officer and president — with Riel as the first woman to hold the roles. When she was appointed to the positions, in fact, it was a message from one of her six granddaughters that truly validated the benefits of having decided to plant roots in the mid-Atlantic. “When I became the president and CEO, one of my granddaughters said, ‘Wow, Grandma, that means I could be a president.’ That meant a lot. And if I could do that for my grandchildren, I can help other women too,” said Riel, who has worked in the banking world for the past 47 years. “I have supported women, and I’ve helped them and mentored them, and many of them I’ve seen grow, and that’s the give-back that to me at my age and my tenure in this business is more important than almost anything.” Before arriving at EagleBank as it was forming into a regional bank in the late 1990s, Riel was executive vice president of Columbia First Bank prior to First Union Bancorp (now Wells Fargo) acquiring it in 1995. In addition to steering EagleBank’s growth as a commercial real estate lender since assuming the role of chief operating officer and executive vice president in 1998, Riel has mentored many women also seeking to advance into banking leadership roles in a historically male-dominated profession. Riel spoke with Commercial Observer in late February about climbing the corporate ladder of CRE banking as a woman, changes she is implementing at EagleBank’s business model in the midst of challenging lending conditions, her outlook on the future of the D.C. area, and how the regional banking system is positioned in a higher interest rate environment. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: Where did you grow up, and what was your path into the commercial real estate side of banking? Susan Riel: I grew up in Brooklyn. I come from an Irish-Italian Catholic family: seven children, six girls and one boy, and my brother is the youngest and absolutely the apple of my eye still. I was married at age 24 — which in today’s standard is a little early — but I’m still married to the same gentleman. My husband grew up in rural New Jersey and he didn’t want to live in the city, so I knew before we got married that we would be moving outside of the city. He wanted to move to San Francisco because he had done some training there and absolutely loved it, but it was just entirely too far for me because I needed to be able to get home to visit my family when I needed it, or if they needed it, so it had to be within driving distance for me. So we looked in an area that we could drive back home on a weekend. The first year that I lived in the D.C. area, I went home at least once a month. I had worked part time for a bank when I was in New York and I wanted to get back into banking. I had also worked for what was then Dean Witter and now is Morgan Stanley, but I wanted to get back into banking. Prior to arriving at EagleBank in 1998 you spent 18 years with Signet Bank and Columbia First Bank before they were acquired by Wells Fargo. What drove the move to EagleBank? The bank I was with was sold, and my daughter at that time was a senior in high school and I wanted to spend time with her. The founders of EagleBank were talking to the chief legal officer that I had worked with about bringing someone in who could run a mortgage division. The chief legal officer recommended they call me, and I met with them but I in no way wanted to run a mortgage division. I told them I would help them find people because I did have experience in that. One conversation led to another conversation, and I did join Eagle, and I headed up the operational areas. Ultimately, we brought in a mortgage group and I had that responsibility, but that was after awhile. I have been with Eagle from before the bank launched, and it will be 26 years in March. How has it been to see a bank grow from its founding? When I came in I thought this would be easier than what I had experienced because it was a start-up. I was absolutely wrong. There were a lot of things that you had to do to get set up with all the procedures and policies and contractors. There were so many things in all the hiring of the staff, and I wore many hats because we started with 20 people and opened three branches right away. We had a very small lending group with four lenders, so it was challenging but very rewarding. I remember the first note that we closed. It was very exciting and very challenging, and I loved it. I had the chance to work with very good people. Eagle has had a lot of challenges over the years, and we’ve gotten through those challenges together. Describe what it was like rising through the ranks as a woman in your career. How are conditions now in CRE banking compared to when you first entered the industry? Now in CRE banking you see a lot of women, and, when you go to the [D.C. Bankers Association] meetings, there are a lot of women there. That was not the way it was in the beginning — there weren’t a lot of women in banking. My Eagle experience has been wonderful because I had a very supportive CEO who encouraged the development of women and allowed me to help develop and encourage other women. I have been fortunate in my career in that I’ve only actually looked for one position, and that was when I first moved to the D.C region. After that I was referred or moved with the chairman and the owners, so I’ve been given a blessing to be honest. I had one gentleman I worked for for 18 years, and every time there was a problem in the bank he would say, “Go look at this problem and see what you could do to fix it,” so I had the opportunity to explore all areas of the bank whether it was in operations or in lending or even the investor side. I had progressive managers that allowed that to happen and didn’t think of me as male or female. They saw the talent that I had and gave me that opportunity. There were also a couple people I worked for who were very difficult managers, but I had a good relationship with them. I think they saw the benefits of women in leadership positions and recognized that I had those skills, and so they were able to help me and give me the opportunities. I’ve been blessed, and paying that back is important. So I would say that I believe that the best people to be put in positions should be the people put in positions. But often women are the best people and they’re often not looked at in that light, so I think I can bring more of that focus to them. I think the industry — and, in general, people — are seeing that women leaders are often more effective. You’re planning this year to “revolutionize” EagleBank’s CRE strategy. What changes are you planning and what was the impetus? EagleBank has been known as a CRE bank as that’s how we started. We’ve been successful and a high performer because of that focus. We don’t ever want to lose that because we have expertise in that area and we are recognized in this industry and market for that expertise. But what we want now is to enhance that. We are skilled in the commercial and industrial [C&I] loan market also, so we want to grow that business, which will allow us to diversify on some of the deposits that we have and will also allow us to increase the fee income because that’s what a C&I business does. We’re also looking at enhancing the consumer as we have a consumer part of our book, but not a strong part. The consumers that we have primarily have been people walking into our branches or business owners that bring their personal accounts and their employees’ accounts to us. We will be looking at enhancing that and moving into a digital presence. We don’t want to lose CRE. There are certainly challenges, but we have a strong team of very seasoned people that know the CRE market. We have one gentleman who has been in the CRE market for over 50 years. When things started to become a problem and when it was obvious to us that there were issues, we immediately pulled that team together. That team is strong, and we will get through this. There will be challenges, but we’ll get through them. I’m proud of the team that we have and proud of how we formed through some very challenging times. Speaking of challenging times, how was EagleBank’s lending portfolio positioned before the Federal Reserve began its aggressive interest rate hikes in early 2022? I think we were positioned well, but we were already thinking of expanding and enhancing that model then because, again, the CRE model has helped us and made us high-performing, and we did well for 25 years. But everything is changing, and we had to diversify and we needed to have stickier deposits. We had already recognized that we needed to begin to change our business model — not lose sight of what made us Eagle and made us the bank we are today, but enhance that with the other areas. Growing in the digital space is something that is new for us and it’s new for a lot of banks, but some banks have been in it for a while. So we just launched our digital expansion. We went in quietly so we’re not really active in it right now, but we have been working on it over the last 12 or 18 months so we’re looking at bringing in some good deposits. We knew we needed to change — or what I prefer to call “enhance our model.” What types of loans are you originating now? In the market right now, with the high interest rates, you don’t have many people wanting to pay those rates. There are some that do, and in instances where we have a customer relationship and they are asking us to do something we do whatever we can. We started the bank with a “relationship first” culture, and we will never lose that. You have been a very active lender in the Washington, D.C., market. How do you see the region shaping up in a post-COVID world given there are many office vacancies in the nation’s capital and many businesses looking toward the suburbs? The entire D.C.-Maryland-Northern Virginia region is a strong market. The inner city in particular is struggling, and a lot of that is due to the fact that the government has a third of the office leases and the federal government is not bringing people back to work. The D.C government has announced that they’ll be bringing people back four days a week. The federal government, although they have tried to do that, are fighting unions. The suburbs are flourishing and you could not get a better market than Northern Virginia, and we are recognized in that area. We did an acquisition of Virginia Heritage Bank back in 2014 to get our name in the Virginia market and we also have the naming rights for George Mason University with EagleBank Arena, so that gets us a lot of publicity, too. Virginia was a hard market to break into and it took us a long time, but we are a strong competitor in the Virginia market, and in Maryland and D.C as well. But there’s lots of growth opportunities, and the political environment in Virginia is more pro business than the political environment in Maryland. How do you view the overall health of the regional banking system after last year’s collapse of three banks and the struggles of New York Community Bank in early 2024? I think that there were a lot of things that happened with Silicon Valley Bank that none of us really know, and they made some big mistakes that caused a ripple throughout the industry. The government is the government, and were they part of that? We lost significant deposits during that time, but I will say our team once again pulled together and we’ve worked through that. I am very proud to say that the deposits we lost were more than recovered at the end of 2023, so we were back in a good position. But we struggled with the regional banking crisis like many did at that time. The industry still has not totally recovered from it. Have you seen a lot of regional bank competitors retreat since interest rates began going up? I think we’re all seeing that. The big banks have stopped lending and it’s the regional banks that are still lending, but cautiously lending. If the borrowers don’t need the money, they’re not looking for it because the interest rates are so high. Now they’re talking about bringing those interest rates down, but I also heard about the possibility of an increase in them, so who knows? No one has a crystal ball, and we will have to just manage through whatever is happening. To close on a lighter note, what do you enjoy doing outside of work? Family. I’m fortunate that I have five children, with three of them within 30 minutes of where I live. One is in Charlotte, which is an hour and half flight, and the other lives 30 minutes from a beach house that I have in Delaware. So I spend whatever time I can with my children, but I’m also involved in outside activities. Eagle is very connected in this community. Our lending team, and even outside of the lending team, does a lot of things out in the community. Eagle has always been recognized for all of that.

      "{'title': 'How Denver nonprofits are trying to stem the migrant crisis by reducing poverty, creating stability in Guatemala', 'text': 'JOCOTENANGO, Guatemala — On a quiet cobblestone street in a town 90 minutes outside of Guatemala City, class was in session for hundreds of young Guatemalans on a Monday morning. Children in kindergarten through ninth grade moved through the open-air courtyard of the free private school for disadvantaged students, which is run by a global nonprofit group based in Denver. Painted on the wall by its entrance were the Spanish words, “La escuela, la esperanza” — or “The school, the hope.” More than 1,900 miles north of the School of Hope, Denver city officials and residents have grappled for more than a year with accommodating a surge of immigrants — largely from Venezuela — that has stretched city resources. But going back six decades, Guatemala has served as a recurring source of newcomers to the state, with 2022 census data showing Colorado was home to about 7,900 people who had immigrated from the Central American country. While the influx from Venezuela has drawn the most recent attention, Guatemala has long ranked among the top Latin American sources of migrants to the United States; it only fell behind Mexico and Venezuela during the most recent federal fiscal year. Between 2000 and 2021, the number of foreign-born Guatemalans in the U.S. more than tripled to about 1 million, according to the Pew Research Center. To curb migration, two Denver-area nonprofits are taking a hands-on approach in Guatemala. They’re working on the ground to reduce poverty and address other conditions that have spurred many of its citizens to journey to the U.S. Education for the Children Foundation provides at-risk students with free education, meals and mental health services in Jocotenango, aiming to set them up for future success in their own country. Meanwhile, Lakewood-based Friendship Bridge makes business loans to Indigenous women who are entrepreneurs in rural areas, helping them to build lives for themselves and their families. The migrant crisis “is not an issue that can be handled by any one nation, any one state, any one city or any one nonprofit,” said Juan Carlos Franco Orellana, a general case manager at the Denver nonprofit Servicios de La Raza. But, he added, “organizations like those that are putting in that work to improve conditions in Guatemala — I would say, they’re the ones really making headway.” During a visit by a Denver Post reporter to the School of Hope in late February, eighth grader Juan Carlos spoke about his hopes in a country where a student’s future is broadly determined by education. His last name was withheld, at the school’s request, for privacy. He is one of seven siblings, and a brother has already traveled far from home to chase the American dream. But Juan Carlos, 14, aims to graduate and stay in Guatemala to support his family. He first earned pocket change by polishing shoes on the street. Now, after school lets out for the day, he heads to the local market, where his sister sells chicken. He hawks clothing, making a monthly average of 500 to 600 quetzales, the equivalent of $64 to $77. But the budding entrepreneur has plans that transcend market stalls: to get his high school diploma, then pursue a career as either an agronomist or a chef. “I hope that we have a better future here in Guatemala,” Juan Carlos said in Spanish through a translator, while sitting in a classroom. William Gómez, 42, a career counselor at the school, sees himself in the pupils he mentors. His childhood dream was to become a doctor, he said, but his family couldn’t afford that ambition. His father, a widower, worked for decades at a warehouse to support Gómez and three siblings as they grew up in the nearby city of Antigua. At age 10, Gómez helped craft ceramic figurines to sell at the market. Throughout his life, he’s considered migrating to the U.S. in search of job opportunities. But today, Gómez remains in his home country. He’s buoyed, he said in Spanish, by the hope that his students will “be that change that the country and the world needs.” Civil war, corruption and inequality Present-day Guatemala was forged by a tumultuous history, including decades of civil war and corrupt politics, along with extreme economic inequalities. Significant numbers of residents have left the country to escape those conflicts and pressures — including immigrants who established longstanding Guatemalan communities in Alamosa and Denver. “This is a country that was really built on a base of inequality,” said Regina Bateson, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Colorado Boulder. “The problem is not a sheer lack of wealth. The problem is the distribution of that wealth.” In a nation where about half of the population identifies as Indigenous — the Maya are the largest Native community — those citizens are overwhelmingly impacted by racial prejudice and poverty. The injustices date back centuries, with many Indigenous Guatemalans forced into agricultural labor through debt servitude in the 19th century. The mounting systemic problems exploded into the Guatemalan Civil War in 1960. As the federal military and leftist guerrillas fought for 36 years, more than 200,000 Guatemalans died — most of them Indigenous. The violence drove survivors from their homes. While the war ended in 1996 with a peace accord, “a lot of the issues that caused the civil war remained unresolved,” Bateson said. Today, hundreds of Indigenous families from the municipality of Santa Eulalia in western Guatemala reside in Colorado’s San Luis Valley. Generations have called it home since migrants began resettling there in the 1980s. Father Carlos Alvarez of Alamosa’s Sacred Heart Church said the mountainous region reminded the newcomers of Guatemala, with the church and the mushroom farm — long the immigrants’ largest local employer — serving as community focal points. Many of the Guatemalans who first moved to the valley were originally seeking asylum in the U.S. A group of churches established the San Luis Valley Immigrant Resource Center to remedy the absence of immigration attorneys in the area, said executive director Flora Archuleta. Its team has since helped immigrants prepare their work authorization paperwork and renew their green cards. The parents of Marisol Cristobal-Lucas, 27, came to Alamosa in one of the waves of migration. During Guatemala’s civil war, her father, Lucas Francisco Lucas, was one of the young Mayan men picked up at random by militants and trained for months in guerrilla warfare. In 1986, he crossed the southwestern U.S. desert as an undocumented immigrant to work on the mushroom farm in Colorado with his brother. “It was a good opportunity for them to make good money,” Cristobal-Lucas said. Her mother, Eulalia Cristobal Sebastian, joined her father around 1993. Both had initially expected their stay in the U.S. to be temporary as they saved money. But Cristobal-Lucas said her father eventually became a U.S. citizen through programs set in motion by a Reagan-era amnesty law, and her mother secured a green card. Decades later, Servicios de La Raza’s Orellana said, back in Guatemala, “economically, things are still very hard.” Even blue-collar industries, such as construction, don’t offer the same opportunities as in the U.S. because Guatemala isn’t building infrastructure as quickly, said Orellana, who was born in Guatemala City. Although the country is home to Central America’s largest economy, with its gross domestic product valued at $95 billion in 2022, according to the World Bank, over half of the population lives in poverty. Guatemalans are pushing to reduce government corruption, but Bateson, the CU professor, called domestic politics “pretty complicated,” with elected leaders prone to self-enrichment and involvement with organized crime. “It’s one of the most unstable party systems in the world,” she said. Still, despite Guatemala’s challenges, Vivi Lemus is among immigrants here who work to counter negative perceptions about their homeland. She is a co-owner of Convivio Café, a bilingual coffee shop in northwest Denver, and has now lived in Colorado with her husband for more than 20 years. “You hear corruption, you hear occupation and you hear all the strife,” said Lemus, 48. “You seldom hear about the hospitality, the kindness, the beauty of people, the flavors, the amazing Mayan culture that extends centuries — and the wisdom that is my heritage.” School’s goal is for students “to stay here in Guatemala” With its focus on improving conditions for Guatemalans, Denver-based Education for the Children Foundation began as a scholarship program two decades ago. In 2005, it expanded to open the School of Hope in Jocotenango, with 80 pupils at its start. The student body has since quintupled to 400, with a staff of about 60 employees. Every year, the school accepts 40 or so new students, usually of kindergarten age. “We never advertise, because we have too much demand,” said Sara Miller, the nonprofit’s U.S. executive director. Instead, the pupils’ parents often first learn about the school through word of mouth. About 25% of those parents are illiterate, with the majority having only reached sixth grade in their education, Miller said. Because entry-level jobs often require at least a high school education, unlearned Guatemalans tend to earn a living in the country’s informal economy. The majority of the nation’s working population — 68% of men and 76% of women — tried to make money informally in 2021, says a report by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Miller said her students’ fathers often work as bus drivers and construction workers, while their mothers are paid to make tortillas, clean houses and iron clothes. She estimates that the families earn the equivalent of $200 to $300 per month. Today, evidence of Guatemala’s wealth inequalities is readily apparent. While luxury apartment buildings tower over Guatemala City, to the west in Jocotenango, a shantytown of illegally built homes rises up the hillside of La Vista Hermosa — a makeshift community where about 150 School of Hope families live as squatters, Miller said. The municipal land isn’t zoned for housing because it’s prone to landslides, but residents accept the risk to avoid paying rent. The cobblestone path winding through the neighborhood was traversed by family members picking up their children from the nearby public school. Then, they hopped on motorcycles or into three-wheeled vehicles called tuk-tuks — both cheap modes of transportation in Guatemala. Across from a soccer field, a mural painted on a wall urged “la no violencia,” or nonviolence. The public education system is free, but is “really underfunded,” Miller said, with 60 students crammed into a classroom for just three or four hours of instruction per day. So, some parents opt to enroll their children in private school, though costs quickly add up for school supplies, uniforms and more. The School of Hope helps ease those financial burdens by offering high-quality education at no cost to its students. Aracely Chajón, director of the school’s social services programs, said the students’ families still deal with socioeconomic problems, sometimes resulting in violence, alcoholism and absentee parenting in households. Chajón, 39, said in Spanish that “a very beautiful part of the foundation is to volunteer a place where (students) feel they have the confidence” and the trust to express themselves openly at school. There, “someone listens to them.” During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chajón and Miller watched as several of the school’s pupils left Guatemala, with 10 immigrating as unaccompanied minors to the U.S. to join relatives. But other students decided to remain in the country because they wanted to graduate. The majority returned to school when viral outbreaks eased, Miller said. “Our goal is for them to stay here in Guatemala,” she said. She hopes to open both a preschool and a high school. The foundation plans to construct another building, which will cost $1 million; it’s raised $500,000 for the project so far. “Through education and access to opportunities, (students) can find a good job in Guatemala and be able to support themselves,” Miller said. “Their children will grow up in a very different environment.” Entrepreneurship offers women new opportunities Since Friendship Bridge launched its Guatemala operation in 1998, the Lakewood nonprofit has focused on offering a lifeline through business. It largely supports Indigenous women entrepreneurs by providing business training, individual loans, group lending and education on topics, such as women’s rights. Because of the dearth of medical care in rural Guatemala, the nonprofit also offers health services. More than two decades after its start, Friendship Bridge now serves about 35,000 clients — women who typically come from impoverished communities and share the task of taking care of large families, said Indira Maldonado, the organization’s communications and visual design coordinator. But they often find themselves stuck in “a cycle of the poverty,” she added. Maldonado, 25, places much of the blame on her country’s machismo-inflected culture, which fosters violence, alcoholism and other problems. “In this culture of machismo, it’s really hard for women to have their own voice,” she said. So, the nonprofit seeks to empower women because, “when you give to women, they invest everything for their families,” Maldonado said. Lidia Par Puzul, 37, usually creates her goods at home, shaded under a roof of blue tarp and tin, in the small town of Cipresales in the country’s western highlands. But during The Post’s visit in late February, she demonstrated the art of beading at Friendship Bridge’s Guatemala headquarters in Panajachel. Her wares — Christmas ornaments, chunky necklaces and animal figurines of various colors and sizes — were spread out on the table in front of her as she threaded minuscule beads onto a needle and pulled, working toward the final product: a red bracelet. Like other Mayan women, she wore the traditional outfit of a corte (skirt), huipil (blouse) and faja (belt). She said she knew how to embroider beads on shirts, too. Par Puzul learned how to make handicrafts at 8 years old — a skill taught by her father, who sold them around the country. Saddled with the responsibility of helping her family as the eldest daughter, she dropped out of school after finishing fourth grade. Her mother, also a craftswoman, secured her first loan of 500 quetzales, or about $64 in today’s money, through Friendship Bridge. Par Puzul joined as a young adult and has received several loans herself. She used the money to grow her handicraft shop in Panajachel, which she ran with her husband, José Ibate. She became an artisan in the Handmade by Friendship Bridge program, with the nonprofit selling her products in its online store. In 2017, thieves robbed the couple of materials, products and other items worth about 300,000 quetzales, or $38,414. José Ibate debated immigrating to the U.S. to earn money for the family. But because of Par Puzul’s work with Friendship Bridge, her spouse stayed in Guatemala to rebuild their business together. A mother herself, Par Puzul said in Spanish that, even though school costs a lot of money, “what I want is for my daughters to study, and that is the most important thing.” Saida Perez, 51, is also a businesswoman from Guatemala. But “my story is not very reflective to a lot of my conationals,” she said. Growing up in Guatemala City, “I was a privileged kid that was able to go to a private school,” Perez added. In 1989, she moved to the U.S. with the proper paperwork and is now an American citizen. Perez, who lives in Thornton, runs her own insurance agency and caters to the local Latino community, especially youth and women. As the founder of Alianza Migrante Guatemalteca, or the Guatemalan Immigrant Alliance, she’s one of the advocates behind the establishment of Denver’s Guatemalan consulate in 2004 and the 2013 passage by the state legislature of the Colorado Road and Community Safety Act. That law allows all qualifying Colorado residents — including undocumented immigrants and refugees — to obtain standard driver’s licenses or ID cards. “It’s a challenge to live outside your country, and to keep traditions and to keep the culture and to be represented,” Perez said. “I am always going for more — trying for Guatemalans to have a voice.” Nearly 2,000 miles away, the local teams of Friendship Bridge and Education for the Children Foundation also try to keep attuned to the voices of Guatemalans as they work to improve their lives, year after year. To Maldonado, nonprofits like Friendship Bridge “support this vision for women to have better futures, and the next generations to have better futures.” As a country, she said, “we’re growing — maybe with tiny steps, but we’re growing.”', 'url': 'https://www.denverpost.com/2024/03/24/guatemala-denver-migrant-crisis-nonprofits-schools-women-businesses/', 'image':

       " 'text': 'Nonbank mortgage originator Change Lending will become a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB-SF). The Anaheim, California-based originator’s application was approved on Wednesday after it fulfilled all statutory requirements for membership, including those related to capital, profitability and liquidity, the company reported. Change’s membership will become effective upon its acquisition of the required $7 million capital stock in the FHLB-SF. The transaction is expected to close in May. “We welcome a partnership with the FHLB-SF to enhance our strength and reach as America’s CDFI,” said Steven Sugarman, founder of the Change Company, the parent company of Change Lending. “We are excited to expand our impact and better serve our target market borrowers.” Change is a community development financial institution (CDFI) that is certified by the U.S. Treasury Department, given to specialized organizations that provide financial services to low-income communities and others who lack financing options. Change and the Treasury Department went through a short-lived legal dispute after the lender sued the CDFI Fund for its “flawed analysis and mathematical errors,” leading to a decertification of Change Lending. The Treasury Department renewed the certification in February following a settlement agreement in November 2023. Change Lending’s services include small-business loans and lines of credit, investor real estate loans, rehab loans and renovation loans, according to its website. Since becoming a CDFI in 2018, Change has funded more than $25 billion in loans to more than 75,000 borrowers, the lender reported. Last year, Change Lending ranked as the top nonqualified mortgage (non-QM) originator, posting $4.1 billion in 2022 production volume, per Scotsman Guide.',\n",

      "{'title': 'Change Lending to join Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco', 'text': 'Nonbank mortgage originator Change Lending will become a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB-SF). The Anaheim, California-based originator’s application was approved on Wednesday after it fulfilled all statutory requirements for membership, including those related to capital, profitability and liquidity, the company reported. Change’s membership will become effective upon its acquisition of the required $7 million capital stock in the FHLB-SF. The transaction is expected to close in May. “We welcome a partnership with the FHLB-SF to enhance our strength and reach as America’s CDFI,” said Steven Sugarman, founder of the Change Company, the parent company of Change Lending. “We are excited to expand our impact and better serve our target market borrowers.” Change is a community development financial institution (CDFI) that is certified by the U.S. Treasury Department, given to specialized organizations that provide financial services to low-income communities and others who lack financing options. Change and the Treasury Department went through a short-lived legal dispute after the lender sued the CDFI Fund for its “flawed analysis and mathematical errors,” leading to a decertification of Change Lending. The Treasury Department renewed the certification in February following a settlement agreement in November 2023. Change Lending’s services include small-business loans and lines of credit, investor real estate loans, rehab loans and renovation loans, according to its website. Since becoming a CDFI in 2018, Change has funded more than $25 billion in loans to more than 75,000 borrowers, the lender reported. Last year, Change Lending ranked as the top nonqualified mortgage (non-QM) originator, posting $4.1 billion in 2022 production volume, per Scotsman Guide.', 'url': 'https://www.housingwire.com/articles/change-lending-to-join-federal-home-loan-bank-of-san-francisco/', 'image': 'https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FHLBanks.jpeg', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/self-guided-tours.jpeg?w=1024&resize=540,275'}, {'url': 'https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FHLBanks.jpeg'}], 'publish_date': '2024-03-14 16:14:20', 'authors': [], 'language': 'en', 'sentiment': 0.181, 'entities': [{'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Bank', 'latitude': 50.82939910888672, 'longitude': 6.0697197914123535, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'San Francisco', 'latitude': 37.77492904663086, 'longitude': -122.41941833496094, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Anaheim', 'latitude': 33.835289001464844, 'longitude': -117.91449737548828, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'California', 'latitude': 37.250221252441406, 'longitude': -119.75125885009766, 'location_type': 'UNIT'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'America', 'latitude': 39.7599983215332, 'longitude': -98.5, 'location_type': 'COUNTRY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Change', 'latitude': 32.14590072631836, 'longitude': 74.52554321289062, 'location_type': 'CITY'}, {'type': 'LOC', 'name': 'Scotsman', 'latitude': -25.628049850463867, 'longitude': 31.419260025024414, 'location_type': 'POI'}]}\n"

Change Lending, LLC, a community development financial institution (CDFI), announced that the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB-SF) has approved its application for membership. The non-bank lender has 60 days to fund the required capital stock purchase, which will be around $7 million, and expects the transaction to close in May.

We are excited to expand our impact and better serve our target market borrowers.\" Change Lending, along with its parent, The Change Company, hold certification from the U.S. Department of the Treasury as CDFIs.

       "  'content': 'The Harbor Bank of Maryland has partnered with digital account onboarding specialist Prelim. Courtesy of the partnership, the Baltimore, Maryland-based financial institution will leverage Prelim’s technology and expertise to enhance its account opening services. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Prelim made its Finovate debut at FinovateSpring 2022. Digital account onboarding specialist Prelim and the Harbor Bank of Maryland have teamed up to bring digital account opening services to the customers of the Baltimore, Maryland-based financial institution. Founded in 1982 with $2.1 million in assets, Harbor Bank of Maryland serves the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area with seven branch locations and a loan office in Silver Spring, Maryland. The bank offers a wide variety of banking services, including checking, savings, time deposits, credit and debit cards, and commercial real estate, as well as personal, home improvement, and other installment and term loans. With total assets of $377 million, Harbor Bank of Maryland is a designated Minority Depository Institution (MDI) and the first community bank in the U.S. to have an investment subsidiary, Harbor Financial Services. San Francisco, California-based Prelim made its Finovate debut at FinovateSpring in 2022 and returned again the following year for FinovateSpring 2023. Co-founded in 2017 by Heang Chan (CEO) and Chris Blaser (CTO), Prelim offers a white-label platform that empowers banks to digitize their business banking operations. Via API, Prelim enables financial institutions to automate their business account onboarding, as well as connect to third party providers to meet AML, BSA, and CIP requirements. The platform also helps FIs launch other financial services and banking products from lending to merchant services. In addition to its partnership with the Harbor Bank of Maryland, Prelim last month announced a collaboration with Movement Bank. Headquartered in Danville, Virginia, Movement Bank was launched in 1919 by a team of African American doctors, teachers, farmers, and preachers. From humble origins in a church basement and $6,500 in capital, the financial institution has grown into a major community resource. The bank was among the first to reopen during the Great Depression after banks were forced to close. The institution was also one of the first banks in Virginia to issue Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans back in 1934. Movement Bank currently has $150 million in total assets.

       "  'content': 'Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin During the last week in March, there were several significant foreclosures (hundreds of millions of dollars per property). They included properties in San Francisco and Mountain View, CA, a large complex in Washington, D.C., and a medical office building (still under construction) in the southern part of Florida. YoY Change in National Rent Index (2019-Present) Apartment List Leveraged loan delinquencies now exceed 6% (normal is <3%). This level is approaching the levels seen in the ’01, ’08, and ’20 Recessions. According to Moody’s, office vacancies are at record highs. Commercial Real Estate (CRE) prices are in freefall. According to Rosenberg Research, 29% of all CRE, and 56% of office loans now have negative equity. Retail malls are struggling, and the multi-family space is overbuilt (falling rents). It will be informative to see the additions to their loan loss reserves as banks post their Q1 results in April. Equity Markets Yet, despite the growing problems in the CRE sector and cracks appearing in the economic landscape, equity prices continue to scale new heights. The S&P 500 and the DJIA both hit record closing highs on Thursday (March 28), with the Nasdaq a hair’s breadth away from its record closing high of March 22nd. The equity market continues to be driven by momentum, and traditional valuation metrics, like the PE (Price/Earnings) Ratio are significantly above their median values (see chart below). PE Ratio for S&P 500: 29.00 Gurufocus Cracks in the Foundation Meanwhile, over the past quarter or so, we’ve seen flat to falling Industrial Production, lower retail sales volumes, shrinking exports, flat to negative capital spending, and a net loss of full-time jobs (being replaced by part-time ones). Yet, in the face of this data, both the Atlanta and St. Louis Federal Reserve District Banks are forecasting a stunning +2.3% growth rate for Q1 GDP. This appears to be extremely optimistic. In addition, the media is still touting “the economy is strong” mantra. We think the growth is much lower, as do many research houses. Rosenberg Research, for example, is projecting -0.5% Q1 GDP growth based on the trends in the following data over the past three months: MORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR Best Tax Software Of 2022 Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022 Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes Industrial Production (-2,7% Annual Rate (AR AR )) Retail Sales volume (-5.3% AR) Core CORE Capex Orders (-0.9% AR) Exports (-1.1% AR) Full-Time employment (-5.2% AR) In addition, Rosenberg reports that same store sale have contracted in dollar terms (-0.2% year over year). Worse, when adjusted for inflation (i.e. looking at volumes), that number becomes a negative (-1.3%) and has been negative for five quarters in a row. That was last seen in the Great Recession (see chart below). Furthermore, if we look at Wall Street’s earnings growth estimates for Q2, these are flat as a pancake, and we have the major retailers (TGT, HD, LOW, WMT) all commenting in their Q4 earnings calls that consumers have tightened their purse strings. The latest retail reports from the likes of Lululemon and Nike NKE were also downbeat as both reported disappointing sales, softening demand, and slower traffic. Volume Growth at Consumer Businesses Bloomberg, Rosenberg Research In past blogs, we’ve commented on the rapid rise in credit card balances. That’s because personal savings have been depleted. And now we are seeing rapidly rising credit card, auto loan, and other consumer loan delinquencies. Consumer Loans: Delinquency Rate Universal Value Advisors Home Prices and the “Wealth Effect” Rising home prices often lead to what economists call the “wealth effect.” That is, when home prices rise, homeowners tend to spend more because they feel they can afford higher consumption as their “wealth” is higher. That particular effect is now waning. Both the Case-Shiller and the FHFA Home Price Indexes are displaying steep negative slopes with the FHFA Index already in negative territory. The housing boom may very well be ending. S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index; FHFA House Price Index Universal Value Advisors The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell in March with the Future Expectations sub-index now at a six-month low. Less than 15% of those surveyed see the economy improving in the next six-months, while plans to purchase a car or major home appliance were the weakest since July ’22, and September ’11 before that. Growth Forecasts While the mothership Fed recently raised its GDP growth forecast for 2024 from 1.4% to 2.1% and lowered its U3 Unemployment Level at year’s end to 4.0% from 4.1%, reports from the Fed’s Regional District Banks aren’t as sanguine. The Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing Index showed up as -14.4 in March, even lower than February’s -11.3. Production, New Orders, and Shipments were negative and the workweek contracted. The Dallas Fed’s Services Index was also weak at -5.0; again lower than in February (-3.9). The Philly Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index, at -18.3 in March, has now shown contraction for three months in a row. New Orders, Backlogs, and Inventories all shrank. And full-time job growth was the lowest since last June. The Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index was also negative in March (-11), and, again, worse than the -5 reading in February. This marked the sixth month in a row of contraction. Negatives were seen in in the indexes for New Orders, Capacity Utilization, and Backlogs. In addition, Business Spending was the most contractionary since July ’20. The chart shows the Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index. This comprehensive index has been in negative terrain since Q4 ’22. Chicago Fed National Activity Index Universal Value Advisors The Fed and Interest Rates Chairman Powell and other FOMC members continue to insist that they need to see more “good” inflation data before embarking on a lowering rate agenda. We had some bumps in the road on the disinflation path in January and February. At his recent press conference after the Fed’s latest meeting, the Chairman eased market angst, saying that the Fed would not overreact to the hotter than anticipated January and February inflation data. On Friday (March 29th), the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index (PCE) printed a +0.3% number (+0.332% to the third decimal), down slightly from January’s +0.4% (+0.376%). Nevertheless, due to “base effects,” the year over year rate (2.45%) ticked up slightly from January’s 2.43%, the first uptick in quite some time, but ever so slight. As inflation falls to target, statistically, such deviations can be expected. The core PCE measure, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, also rose 0.3% in February, and 2.8% on the year over year measure, down slightly from 2.9% in January. The PCE report won’t do anything to change FOMC views that the last part of the inflation fight will take a little longer. As seen from the chart below, the Core PCE Price Deflator is lower than the Core CPI Index. That’s good news as that is the index to which the Fed reacts. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index Yahoo! Finance On Friday (April 5th), the CPI for March will be announced. As we have discussed in past blogs, our view is that the lagged shelter component in the CPI will be de-escalating the annual rate of CPI inflation through year’s end. Markets apparently agree with this assessment, as the odds of a June rate cut have now climbed to as high as 70%. The June 11-12 Fed meeting is still nearly two and a half months away. A lot can and will happen in this interim. Final Thoughts CRE issues are mounting, and foreclosures are in their early stages. We expect large impacts on the financial sector over the next several months. This alone will throw the economy into Recession. Banks’ loan loss provisions in their upcoming Q1 financial reports will shed a lot of light on this topic. Despite growing cracks in the economy, the equities market continues to hit record high closing prices. Traditional valuation metrics strongly suggest that equities are in overvaluation territory. Cracks in non-financial sectors also continue to appear. Manufacturing looks to already be in Recession, and the Consumer, who has driven this economy for the last several quarters, appears to now be out of gas. While the Fed recently raised its 2024 GDP forecast and lowed its year end unemployment rate prediction, emerging data show weakening retail sales, production and housing. The Regional Fed Bank surveys suggest the same. Despite the January/February upticks, all the other measures continue to show disinflation (slowing rates of inflation). Instead of the “bumps in the road” making Fed Chair Powell more hawkish, he surprised markets at his recent press conference by assuring them that the inflation fight was being won. We agree with that assessment. Due to the lag in shelter data built into the CPI, significantly lower inflation (i.e., disinflation) is all but guaranteed. Thus, the odds of a June rate cut now appear to be significant. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.) Follow me on Twitter. Check out my website.

       "  'content': \"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Zain Jaffer is the founder and president of Zain Ventures, a family office that invests in real estate and proptech. getty In late January 2024, four U.S. Senators, namely Elizabeth Warren, John Hickenlooper, Jacky Rosen and Sheldon Whitehouse, wrote to U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell urging him to cut interest rates. “As the Fed weighs its next steps in the new year, we urge you to consider the effects of your interest rate decisions on the housing market,” the senators wrote. “The direct effect of these astronomical rates has been a significant increase in the overall home purchasing cost to the average consumer,” they added. The U.S. housing market is virtually frozen, save for a few buyers and sellers who absolutely need to buy or sell and move elsewhere for various personal reasons. Although mortgage rates in early January lowered a bit to around 6.7%, the average rate reached as high as 7.8% in mid-October 2023. In November 2020, it was around 2.7%, which is a difference of around 5%. The problem is that inflation is not yet under the Fed's target 2% goal. In 2020, it was around 1.2%, but the cash infusion into the economy during the pandemic helped push it to 8% in 2022. Not making debt expensive through rate hikes would have meant risking hyperinflation, which could have serious consequences. The Fed has two tools to fight it: Quantitative tightening means that they no longer buy treasury bonds and bills and mortgage backed securities (MBS) from banks so in effect they have less cash to lend out, and higher interest rates, meaning the banks need to raise the lending rate to their clients because the money they borrow from the Fed is now more expensive. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor How are high interest rates affecting the real estate sector? To say that high interest rates have decimated the real estate sector is an understatement. Many real estate projects are financed largely with debt, with just a little equity from the developer. The housing market is negatively impacted, but so is office and retail commercial real estate space, particularly in large cities where there is a lot of competition. Although Class A properties are still doing relatively okay because big companies and high-end professional offices want slick, cool office spaces to entice their workforce and impress their clients, I've noticed the older non-ESG-compliant office buildings are not doing so well. Many workers prefer to work from home (WFH), assuming they have not been laid off because of poor economic conditions or that artificial intelligence (AI) hasn’t replaced them yet. On the bright side, parking lots and warehouses are still doing okay, especially since online retail is quite popular. The situation is so bad that I hear of established developers doing a firesale on their offices in places like San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles just to offload some of these properties off their books. They realize that at high interest rates, the math on these investments no longer works. Then there is also the mountain of corporate debt that had originally been lent at low interest rates to companies for their operations and capex prior to the Fed hikes. Many companies are already struggling to meet their monthly payments, and now, with their loans maturing, they need to renegotiate with their bank or lender at higher rates. For some of them, they will need to throw in the towel if expected inflows will not meet contractual outflow needs. For businesses, the goal is to survive. At this point, the question is no longer how to make lots of money for some businesses. For many, their goal right now is to simply survive until the interest rates go lower, when they feel they can pay off the new renegotiated loans with what they predict will lower cash inflows or revenues to their businesses. If you are running a business, you may have talked to your banker about renegotiating your loan so that you do not miss payments. This may mean adding more years to the repayment period, but the alternative is to default on the loan—within reason, of course. If the project no longer makes sense, such as an office project that is mostly vacant, you may need to find a buyer for the property or turn that business into something else. Aside from talking to your banker (or lender) about restructuring your debt to be easier to service, you also need to go all out on your sales efforts. This is the time for creative marketing strategies and for your sales team to really hit and exceed their quotas. Making sure your debt servicing can be met with your inflows is essential for making it through. Surviving to fight for another day is not just a saying for you. It is what you need to do.

       "  'content': 'By Ann Saphir, Saeed Azhar and Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) - U.S. regional lenders face ongoing challenges from rising deposit costs and risky office-building loans a year after the biggest bank failures since 2008. The unexpected collapses of three banks - Silicon Valley and Signature in March 2023 and First Republic in May - put a spotlight on how lenders managed risks to assets and liquidity as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to bring surging inflation under control. Now that the Fed has stopped raising rates but has signaled cuts may not come for another several months, investors have shifted their focus to the potential for customers to pull their deposits in times of stress, while gauging lenders\\' exposure to the troubled commercial real estate (CRE) sector. \"The banking industry needs to make sure it has a strong hold on its access to liquidity, conduct in-depth deposit stress testing, and ensure it can withstand significant stress,\" said Ryan Nash, banking analyst at Goldman Sachs. \"This is something that all banks will need to plan for in the world ahead.” The tumult prompted emergency government measures to stabilize the sector alongside downgrades by credit rating agencies. In recent weeks, New York Community Bancorp has fueled market jitters about renewed weakness in the sector after it disclosed major losses and warned of material weakness in its internal controls. \"Last year’s bank stress underscores the importance of not becoming complacent,\" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in New York City last week, noting that the bank failures were due not just to poor risk management but also to weaknesses in supervision. The following graphics show the impact of Silicon Valley Bank\\'s (SVB) collapse on the industry, one year after its March 10 failure. In its immediate aftermath, business lending plunged and banks pulled back on credit more broadly. In recent months, both measures have improved, but are still below year-ago levels. Commercial lending has bumped along in recent months, barely regaining lost ground after SVB\\'s failure. Regional banks have relatively large exposure to CRE loans, compared with larger peers that have more diversified portfolios. Lenders are under pressure to write down their losses from CRE as offices remain sparsely populated by workers on hybrid or remote work arrangements. Growth in CRE lending slowed dramatically after SVB\\'s failure and continued to decelerate through the year. Loans by regional and community banks, which account for the bulk of CRE lending, are still above last year, but the biggest banks have trimmed their CRE loan portfolios. Recent Boston Fed research suggests that, even so, it may be the biggest banks that are more vulnerable to CRE losses, with 40% of their office building loans in counties with a high share of work-from home, versus 30% for smaller banks. The turmoil of March 2023 triggered \"stress for most, crisis for a few\" banks, said Christopher Wolfe, head of North American Banks ratings at Fitch. It highlighted the importance of banks maintaining solid insured and operational deposits to underpin their funding. \"The banks most caught out were material outliers,\" in terms of their sources of deposits, he said. Depositors fled smaller U.S. lenders for the safety of bigger institutions after SVB failed, but some funds have since flowed back. Overall deposits in banks of all sizes are down compared with a year earlier as households have spent their savings or chased higher returns in money markets or rallying equities. More than 90% of Silicon Valley Bank\\'s deposits were not insured by a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp guarantee, which covers at least $250,000 in deposit accounts. SVB\\'s uninsured deposits stood at twice the average of its peers. It was toppled after clients who were concerned about the bank\\'s health pulled their money, regulators found. Since last year, the proportion of uninsured deposits in the industry has declined, FDIC data shows. \"When your customer deposit base is making big withdrawals over the short term, it will definitely cause a liquidity squeeze,\" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at Argus Research. \"No amount of capital levels will be able to save a bank that has 40% of their deposits leave in 24-48 hours.\" Investors generally expect regional bank stocks to be more volatile than stocks of bigger banks and larger financial institutions. For this reason, there tends to be a gap between the implied volatility of regional stocks and larger banks. This gap, which widened sharply during the March turmoil, has not gone back to pre-crisis levels. The spread reflects investors\\' lingering perception that regional banks are a less safe bet than bigger lenders. \"The risks facing regional banks right now would be an environment of higher-for-longer rates,\" said Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer of Treasury Partners. As banks pay more to retain customer deposits, the money they earn from interest payments is eroded, he said, referring to a measure called net interest margin. Saperstein expects more banks to set aside reserves for potential losses on CRE loans, particularly related to offices. He also predicts ratings agencies will continue to downgrade regional lenders. Regional banks in particular saw a decline in net interest income as they had to pay more to depositors versus larger peers while demand from borrowers stays subdued. The stocks of regional lenders were hit when SVB\\'s troubles first emerged, and have lagged the overall U.S. equity market over the past year. The KBW Regional Banking index has slumped roughly 12% since the banking issues first flared in March 2023, while the S&P 500 - the benchmark for the U.S. stock market - has gained 28% in that time, fueled by huge gains for megacap technology and growth stocks. The S&P 500 banks index, which includes major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, has fared better, rising some 12% over the past year, though still trailing the overall S&P 500.

       "  'content': 'Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) collapse was one of the largest banking failures in American history. And according to a report Tuesday (March 12) by Bloomberg News, that collapse brought with it the largest penalty since before the 2008 financial crisis: $285 million in fees to retire emergency financing the lender had gotten from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system. The report, citing an internal Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) document obtained by Bloomberg, said that SVB had received billions in financing in an eleventh-hour effort to withstand the run on deposits that led to its seizure by regulators. The FHLB system was established during the Great Depression to back mortgage lending. In addition to SVB, two other lenders that went out of business last year — Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank — had also borrowed billions from the program. SVB and Signature both collapsed within days of each other last March, the same week that saw Silvergate voluntarily close its doors. Elliot Sloane, a spokesman for the San Francisco FHLB, which floated the money to SVB, told Bloomberg the bank “worked diligently and urgently to provide critical liquidity to Silicon Valley Bank in the days prior to its failure.” When SVB went under, the FHLB was within its rights to recall its money but chose not to do so, said Sloane. Instead, the bridge bank that took over SVB moved to repay the advances early and take on the cost laid out in the contract, thus getting full control of SVB’s assets that had been pledged as collateral to the home-loan bank. Marking the one-year anniversary of the SVB collapse earlier this week, PYMNTS wrote that the lessons of its failure extend beyond the world of regional banking. “In a fundamental shift in the corporate world, a dozen CFOs noted to PYMNTS in a series of interviews that CFOs are now tasked with managing liquidity levels and cash availability at the board, management and even employee levels,” that report said. “They’ve been crafting bank-risk frameworks and looking toward vendor and third-party risks, where financial supply chains are at least as important as all other business relationships.” What’s not known, that report added, is whether those new measures will be enough. Bank runs look a lot different than they used to, PYMNTS wrote, and the “only certainty is that the banking system will be tested again.”',\n",

       "  'content': \"Quiver Quantitative - The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year came with a hefty price tag, not just for the bank itself, but also for the US banking system at large. A crucial yet overlooked aspect of SVB's collapse was the $285 million in fees charged for prematurely ending emergency financing from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system. This fee, necessary to retire billions in financing obtained by SVB in a desperate bid to survive a run on deposits, is the largest of its kind for any bank failure since before the 2008 financial crisis. This situation highlights the significant role of FHLBs in providing emergency lending, even to banks that eventually fail, and brings into focus the ongoing debate in Washington about reforming this Depression-era system initially designed to finance mortgage lending. In the wake of this incident, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the home-loan banks, is considering revising the rules regarding prepayment fees. The rationale behind allowing FHLBs to charge such fees, even from failing borrowers, is to let these institutions recoup the costs associated with retiring the debt, ensuring their financial stability. However, these fees also stoke the debate over the appropriate use of FHLBs in the modern banking landscape, especially concerning their support to struggling banks. The SVB incident, where the FHLB of San Francisco provided $30 billion in emergency financing, underscores the significant reliance of banks on the FHLB system for more than just mortgage financing. Market Overview: -FHLB System Scrutinized: The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) raises questions about the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system's practices, particularly regarding fees charged for early repayment of emergency financing. -Record Fee Charged: A $285 million fee levied against SVB for early repayment is the largest of its kind for a failed bank since before 2006. -Reform Debate Ignited: This incident fuels discussions about potential reforms to the FHLB system, with concerns about profit prioritization over responsible lending practices. -Focus on Core Mission: Consumer advocates urge the FHLB system to return to its original purpose of supporting mortgage lending, rather than acting as a general source of liquidity for failing institutions. Key Points: -Record Fee for FHLB: The $285 million fee charged to SVB for early repayment of emergency financing is the largest on record for a failed bank since at least 2006. -Reform Debate: This incident fuels the debate surrounding FHLB practices, with concerns about the system's prioritization of profit over responsible lending practices. -Prepayment Fee Impact: The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is considering rule changes regarding prepayment fees, aiming to encourage FHLBs to conduct more thorough assessments before offering substantial financing to struggling institutions. -FHLB Defense: The Council of Federal Home Loan Banks argues that these fees compensate the institutions for costs incurred when unwinding financing agreements. -Focus on Core Function: Consumer advocates urge the FHLB system to refocus on its core mission of supporting mortgage lending, rather than serving as a general source of liquidity for failing banks. Looking Ahead: -The FHFA's potential rule changes regarding prepayment fees will be closely monitored to see if they address concerns about FHLB practices. -The broader debate about the FHLB system's role and its adherence to its original mission is likely to continue. SVB's decision to pay back the FHLB financing early, along with the hefty fees, was a critical move in managing the bank's collapse. This action allowed full control of SVB's assets, which had been pledged as collateral to the home-loan bank. Silicon Valley Bank was ultimately acquired by First Citizens BancShares, which continues to use the SVB brand. This scenario is part of a broader trend where numerous banks, amidst last year's financial turmoil, chose to repay their FHLB advances early, incurring penalties. The FHLB system loaned out approximately $676 billion in a single week at the peak of the crisis, demonstrating its vital role in stabilizing the banking industry. The incident with SVB and the subsequent fees charged by FHLB reveal the evolving role of these institutions in the modern financial system. While FHLBs were originally created to support housing finance, their function has expanded significantly, often being utilized as a convenient source of liquidity for financial firms for various purposes. The reliance on FHLBs for emergency funding and the associated penalties in cases of early repayment raise questions about the broader use of these banks and their role in addressing financial crises and housing issues. The debate over FHLB reform and the proper scope of their activities continues to be a pressing issue in the US financial regulatory landscape.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'The date was September 22, 1957. Just one week after his landslide reelection to a third term as West Germany’s chancellor, Konrad Adenauer was the guest on CBS’s Face the Nation in a special television broadcast from Germany. The network’s Bonn bureau chief came right out and asked him: “Next January you will be 82 years old. By the time your term has run its course, you will be in your 86th year. Do you really want to continue working at this hard job that long?” Adenauer allowed a faint smile. Through an interpreter, he answered that when Pope Leo XIII turned 90, the dean of the Vatican diplomatic corps had congratulated the pontiff and expressed a wish that he should reach 100. Adenauer, who was Catholic, added, with a twinkle in his eye, “The Pope replied to the dean: ‘But why should you want to set any limits to divine grace?’ I reply the same to you!” The polls today show that many voters regard Joe Biden as too old or enfeebled to serve another four-year term. How can anyone know whether someone that age will be up for the demands of the Oval Office? Yet the life of Konrad Adenauer (1876–1967) proves that a dedicated head of state can not only serve robustly at an advanced age, despite periodic illnesses and public criticism, but can be transformative and make history. Like President Biden, Adenauer was repeatedly accused of senility. He occasionally tumbled in public. His political obituary was written up in the press numerous times. Yet he served in the West German government as an extremely competent head of state, vigorous and active, into his ninth decade. When Adenauer was first elected chancellor of the newly formed Federal Republic of (West) Germany in 1949, he was 73 and widely regarded as a caretaker, too old for lengthy service in office. He even announced before the vote that his doctor had given him the all clear for another two years. Octogenarians who still went to work were far rarer then than today. Adenauer was so old that he had first been a leading candidate for chancellor back in the late 1920s. Yet he ended up being reelected three times (in a 1956 Gallup poll, 75 percent of the electorate “recognized his achievements”) and served until he resigned in the middle of his fourth term in 1963. Age 87 at that time, he continued in office as head of the Christian Democratic Union party until he was 90. The West German public referred to him as Der Alte (roughly, “the old guy”). Der Alte, who had never even traveled to Washington, Rome, or Paris until he was 75, almost single-handedly transformed a bombed-out, impoverished, and reviled rogue nation into a civilized democracy and economic powerhouse, repaired the century-old rift with France, and became the chief architect of the continent’s Euro-federation model that has held firm for 75 years. In an address to the House of Commons on May 11, 1953, Winston Churchill praised Adenauer as “the wisest German statesman since the days of Bismarck.” There are several surprising parallels between Joe Biden and Konrad Adenauer. Both had to overcome chronic impediments from their youth (Biden’s stutter, Adenauer’s weak lungs). Appointed lord mayor of Cologne in 1917, Adenauer was the youngest municipal leader in Prussia, just as Joe Biden at 29 was the youngest U.S. Senator in 1972. Both men were thought to have reached the end of their long political careers in their early 70s, only to reinvent themselves, capture the top job, and embark on dramatic policy innovations. Both men were doubted and ridiculed by the press and their political opponents for being too old and missing a step, though not by pols who worked with them behind closed doors. Both attended Mass regularly while holding the top office. Both men repeatedly overcame devastating emotional setbacks and stayed in the political arena. And like Biden, Adenauer was scarred for life by a terrible automobile accident in his young adult years. Adenauer never learned to drive and preferred his official chauffeurs to drive fast. In mid-March 1917, Adenauer was deputy mayor of Cologne when his driver fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into a streetcar. The impact catapulted Adenauer through the glass partition and shattered his face. Both of his cheekbones and his nose were broken, several teeth were knocked from his jaw, his eyesight was blurred, and he bled profusely from multiple lacerations. Yet he stood up and walked unaided to the hospital, where he was sewn up without anesthetic. This stoic refusal to capitulate to medical setbacks (or political defeats) characterized the rest of his life. At the beginning of October 1923, still mayor of Cologne, Adenauer was hospitalized with appendicitis, a life-threatening illness requiring a long convalescence in those pre-antibiotic days. Only three weeks after the surgery, he was back at his desk dealing with the British and French occupation and crises of public unrest, unemployment, and hyperinflation. The auto accident happened only a few months after Adenauer’s beloved wife Emma, after repeated difficult childbirths, died of kidney problems at only 36. When the lord mayor of Cologne resigned in August 1917, deputy mayor Adenauer was in a sanatorium, still convalescing from his injuries (and no doubt still bereaved). A delegation from Adenauer’s Centre Party visited him to check his eligibility for lord mayor, suspecting that he had sustained a concussion and brain damage. They gave him a challenging two-hour cognitive assessment test, and Adenauer answered everything perfectly. He was elected lord mayor in September and served until Hitler took power in 1933. He was also head of the upper house of the Prussian State parliament from 1921. On February 17, 1933, Adenauer ordered swastika flags be removed from a bridge in Cologne. Soon afterward, the Nazis not only threw him out of the mayoralty but also out of his house, denying him even his salary, pension, and bank account—in part because of his friendly relations with the Jewish business community in Cologne. Having made bad investments and gone bankrupt in the stock market crash not long before, Adenauer was suddenly destitute. Unemployed, and a target for the Reich, he had to keep a low profile, and lived an itinerant life in monasteries and safe houses for several years, supported by a Jewish businessman friend of his, Daniel Heinemann, until his assets were restored to him in 1937. Adenauer had belonged to Pro Palastina, a support group for Jews who wanted to emigrate to Palestine that would ensure “a safe residence” once they got there. Though he never repaid Heinemann’s cash loan, they stayed friends till late in life, and in the early 1950s, Adenauer became the driving force behind West Germany’s reparations payments to Israel, over the objections of some of his cabinet ministers. But after Claus von Stauffenberg plot to assassinate Hitler failed in July 1944, Adenauer was pursued by the Gestapo, though he was uninvolved in the plot. He was briefly imprisoned at a detention camp near Cologne, but managed to escape and elude recapture. The Gestapo arrested his second wife, Gussi, and interrogated her. Under extreme psychological duress, she broke down and revealed where her husband was. The Gestapo found him and reincarcerated him in the same prison where she was held, but kept them separate. Distraught over having revealed her husband’s whereabouts, Gussi tried to commit suicide twice. The Gestapo then released her. Later, Adenauer’s son Max, who had been conscripted into the Wehrmacht, was able to pull strings to get his father out just before he was about to be deported to a death camp. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the Austrian SS leader who was later hanged at Nuremberg, signed off on Adenauer’s release. Gussi Adenauer died at 52 in 1948, partly from medical aftereffects of her suicide attempts. Adenauer never stopped blaming the Nazis for effectively murdering his second wife. A two-time widower, he never remarried and had no intimate companionship for the rest of his long life, apart from the company of his adult daughters on holidays. Adenauer’s own health was affected by his ordeals under the Third Reich. Skeletal after his release from two months in prison, he appeared frail during the immediate postwar aftermath, when food was scarce in Germany and malnutrition widespread. Previously Adenauer had always been disciplined about his health and self-care. Since receiving a false diagnosis of diabetes when he was 29, he had been abstemious in his diet, drinking wine sparingly. After a childhood bout of TB, which had disqualified him from serving in the Prussian Army as a youth, he never smoked or even allowed office personnel in his presence to smoke. In office as chancellor, he made time to take brisk walks. Repeated bouts of pneumonia plagued him throughout his adult life. By the time he was 80, his doctors advised him not to vacation in the mountains anymore because they thought the thinner air would strain his lungs, though he jetted around the globe extensively on diplomatic trips to the end of his chancellorship. He had headaches for years after the car accident, and chronic insomnia (worsened after 1933) led him to take nightly sleeping pills. As Cologne mayor, he had taken a short nap at lunch every working day; as chancellor he extended his daily lunchtime nap to an hour, a practice he shared with Churchill and Lyndon Johnson. Der Alte knew how to pace himself. As the war wound down in the spring of 1945, the American military governor of Cologne restored Adenauer to the mayoralty; the city had been badly damaged by Allied bombing. It was a brief restoration, though: a few months later, the British, who were by now occupying Cologne, summarily fired Adenauer for “incompetence.” It was a public humiliation. He appeared to be finished politically and physically at 70. Somehow, remarkably, Adenauer got a second wind. He organized a new political party, the Christian Democratic Union, to unite the Catholic and Protestant political blocs. “I was born on 5 January 1876, so I am probably the oldest person here,” Adenauer told the room at the first CDU meeting. “If nobody objects, I will regard myself as president by seniority.” By 1949, he had worked his way up to the top job. Who better than someone who had held government office since 1909, through three eras: the pre–WWI Kaiser era, the Allied postwar occupations of the 1920s, and the Allied postwar occupations of the 1940s—and who had survived close calls under the Nazis without collaborating? His almost Olympian calm and dignity were antidotes to the hysteria of Hitler. In 1948, a journalist reported that Adenauer “looked like a wrinkled mummy with a disconcerting capacity for breaking into speech.” His first term in office was quickly interrupted by illness. In July 1950 he came down with pneumonia and took a month off from work. He was reelected by a large margin in 1953 but in October 1955, a month after his diplomatic trip to the Soviet Union, he was bedridden with pneumonia for six weeks. As one of his biographers, Charles Williams, writes, “the mutterings started almost immediately. The Federal Republic, it was widely said, was run by a very sick and very old man; obviously he could not go on. There were long discussions in the press and on the radio about the date of his retirement—or death—and the identity of his successor.” Even Winston Churchill had retired as prime minister at 80. But Adenauer bounced back. In 1957, unknown to the German public and press, he was taking the controversial “fresh cell therapy” anti-aging treatments developed by the surgeon Paul Niehans at the Clinique La Prairie in Montreux, Switzerland, where Pope Pius XII and other world dignitaries had also been treated. Apparently, it helped. He was again reelected. As he got older, Adenauer husbanded his energies by more frequently conducting State business from his second home in a town on Italy’s Lake Como. Yet he still embarked on an arduous world tour in March 1960, enduring a 16-hour flight to New York while riding in the cockpit, and from there traveling to Washington, San Francisco, Hawaii, and Japan. On the return flight to Bonn, he stopped over in Alaska and Iceland. Though he had a bad case of bronchitis in December 1960, he pushed through at work until a public celebration of his 85th birthday seemed to return him to health. Soon enough, he flew to Washington to meet with the newly elected President Kennedy and in April 1961 visited Vice President Johnson’s ranch, where he donned a 10-gallon hat for the cameras. As Adenauer had walked off the airplane and onto the tarmac with Johnson, a TV newsman commented, “He’s 85 years old, and yet he has all the vigor of a man of 50.” Elected a fourth time on November 7, 1961 on the promise that he would resign before the end of his term, Adenauer flew to Washington D.C. for meetings on November 19 despite a fever and a full-blown case of the flu. On December 9, he flew to Paris to meet with Charles de Gaulle. On January 21, 1962, at age 86, Adenauer had a minor heart attack. The public was told he was suffering from a recurrence of influenza. He stayed home in bed for two weeks, but on February 15 he traveled by train to Baden-Baden for another meeting with de Gaulle. One year later in Paris, Adenauer, now 87, and de Gaulle, 72, signed the Élysée Treaty, the Franco-German entente that put an end to centuries of enmity between the two nations. What if Adenauer had been replaced in November 1961 by a younger leader? No younger West German leader had the necessary stature and personal rapport with General de Gaulle to be able to deliver the historic treaty. De Gaulle spoke German, Adenauer some fractured French. They had been meeting one-on-one for years. They had become friends. They were twin icons of their nations’ histories nearing the ends of their lives, and they knew they had to get it right. Throughout his 14 years as chancellor, Adenauer’s political opponents in the Bundestag would try to make fun of his age. In 1958, he tripped and almost fell on the steps to de Gaulle’s house, but 24-hour cable news had not yet been born to record such events. Despite his periodic illnesses, however, Adenauer consistently impressed dignitaries with his youthfulness. In 1953, the former British MP Harold Nicolson, who had met Adenauer in Cologne in 1928, reencountered him and thought he looked “a good twenty years younger.” Prior to Adenauer’s arrival in London for meetings with Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in November 1959, the British political class had gossiped that the West German leader was semi-senile. But after the meetings, Macmillan reported that he was struck by the man’s vitality and that rumors of his senility were nonsense. One of Adenauer’s cabinet ministers, Heinrich Krone, wrote in his diary upon Adenauer’s 87th birthday in 1963: “The Old Man is 87. Fresh, elegant, full of humor, without any sign of weakness. It is not surprising that he does not want to go.” On June 23, 1963, Adenauer rode standing up in an open limousine beside President Kennedy (a man 41 years his junior) through the streets of Cologne. During the Cuban Missile Crisis the previous October, Adenauer had advised Kennedy that he supported the blockade of Cuba, in the belief that the Soviet missiles had been deployed on the island nation to obtain concessions over the then divided city of Berlin. In early 1967, a 91-year-old Adenauer advised private citizen Richard Nixon that Washington should make overtures to Communist China in the hope of “counterbalancing” the Soviet danger. Nixon had met Adenauer many times as vice president and wrote in his book Leaders that he was so impressed by him that he felt that had Adenauer been made chancellor in the late 1920s, there would have been a better chance of Hitler not coming to power. What else did Adenauer accomplish besides weathering multiple bouts of pneumonia, periodic withdrawals, a heart attack, and criticisms of his great age? He reinstituted a free-market economy and opened access to global markets for German industry so rapidly that by 1955, West Germany had become the most powerful economy in Europe. He created social welfare programs, built housing in bombed-out areas, advocated for peaceful nuclear power. He replaced the historically aggressive Prussian face of his nation with a cooperative, integrationist posture, reaching out to such other statesmen as France’s Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman and Belgium’s Paul Henri-Spaak, creating with them the building blocks of a political and economically united Europe: the European Coal and Steel Community; the Common Market; membership in NATO. He ended denazification in the right way, letting ex-Nazis in his government know that if they didn’t toe his liberalizing political line, he would reopen denazification proceedings against them, and he established stringent democratic loyalty tests for ex-Nazis and soldiers in the Bundeswehr (the new armed forces). Though he was autocratic in style, he constructively used that role to gradually transition German citizens away from the custom of an authoritarian leadership to a democratic mode of governance. Above all, he pursued an unwavering alliance with the United States through three U.S. presidencies as a bulwark against possible Soviet aggression not only toward West Germany but to Europe as a whole. He did not succeed in reunifying East and West (that had to wait 25 years), but he set the internationalist template for all the German chancellors who succeeded him. He did all of this as an old man—and largely after his first four-year term. He needed succeeding terms in office to consolidate his achievements, much of which occurred when he was past 80. In Leaders, Nixon recounted an anecdote from his 1970 meeting with Marshal Tito in Belgrade. Tito’s wife told Nixon about a meeting years earlier between her husband and Churchill. Churchill had supposedly looked at her husband and marveled at his youthful appearance. Then Churchill answered his own question: “I know what it is. It’s power. It’s power that keeps a man young.” “When I saw Zhou Enlai in 1972 he was 73; de Gaulle in 1969 was 78; Adenauer in 1959 was 83,” wrote Nixon. “They were still in power because they were stronger and abler than the younger men in their governments. If an older political leader does not suffer from any serious ailments, he will usually make up in wisdom and judgment for what he may lack in stamina, vigor, and mental quickness.” No one can predict the vagaries of old age. Konrad Adenauer himself suffered unpredicted health events after age 82 while still in harness as head of state. Yet no historian I am aware of has ever suggested that Adenauer, infirmities and all, did not remain in full command of his office and his powers till age 87, or that the accomplishments of his later terms were any less consequential because of his age. American voters, pols, and pundits would do well to consider these facts when assessing the fitness of an 82-year-old President Biden as he runs for reelection this year.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Decades ago, Susan Riel’s husband had a chance to relocate to the West Coast. But Riel wanted to stay within driving distance of her close-knit family of seven siblings in Brooklyn. The resulting compromise has kept the couple in the Washington, D.C., region for 50 years. Twenty-one of those years have been spent at EagleBank, more than five of those now as chief executive officer and president — with Riel as the first woman to hold the roles. When she was appointed to the positions, in fact, it was a message from one of her six granddaughters that truly validated the benefits of having decided to plant roots in the mid-Atlantic. “When I became the president and CEO, one of my granddaughters said, ‘Wow, Grandma, that means I could be a president.’ That meant a lot. And if I could do that for my grandchildren, I can help other women too,” said Riel, who has worked in the banking world for the past 47 years. “I have supported women, and I’ve helped them and mentored them, and many of them I’ve seen grow, and that’s the give-back that to me at my age and my tenure in this business is more important than almost anything.” Before arriving at EagleBank as it was forming into a regional bank in the late 1990s, Riel was executive vice president of Columbia First Bank prior to First Union Bancorp (now Wells Fargo) acquiring it in 1995. In addition to steering EagleBank’s growth as a commercial real estate lender since assuming the role of chief operating officer and executive vice president in 1998, Riel has mentored many women also seeking to advance into banking leadership roles in a historically male-dominated profession. Riel spoke with Commercial Observer in late February about climbing the corporate ladder of CRE banking as a woman, changes she is implementing at EagleBank’s business model in the midst of challenging lending conditions, her outlook on the future of the D.C. area, and how the regional banking system is positioned in a higher interest rate environment. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: Where did you grow up, and what was your path into the commercial real estate side of banking? Susan Riel: I grew up in Brooklyn. I come from an Irish-Italian Catholic family: seven children, six girls and one boy, and my brother is the youngest and absolutely the apple of my eye still. I was married at age 24 — which in today’s standard is a little early — but I’m still married to the same gentleman. My husband grew up in rural New Jersey and he didn’t want to live in the city, so I knew before we got married that we would be moving outside of the city. He wanted to move to San Francisco because he had done some training there and absolutely loved it, but it was just entirely too far for me because I needed to be able to get home to visit my family when I needed it, or if they needed it, so it had to be within driving distance for me. So we looked in an area that we could drive back home on a weekend. The first year that I lived in the D.C. area, I went home at least once a month. I had worked part time for a bank when I was in New York and I wanted to get back into banking. I had also worked for what was then Dean Witter and now is Morgan Stanley, but I wanted to get back into banking. Prior to arriving at EagleBank in 1998 you spent 18 years with Signet Bank and Columbia First Bank before they were acquired by Wells Fargo. What drove the move to EagleBank? The bank I was with was sold, and my daughter at that time was a senior in high school and I wanted to spend time with her. The founders of EagleBank were talking to the chief legal officer that I had worked with about bringing someone in who could run a mortgage division. The chief legal officer recommended they call me, and I met with them but I in no way wanted to run a mortgage division. I told them I would help them find people because I did have experience in that. One conversation led to another conversation, and I did join Eagle, and I headed up the operational areas. Ultimately, we brought in a mortgage group and I had that responsibility, but that was after awhile. I have been with Eagle from before the bank launched, and it will be 26 years in March. How has it been to see a bank grow from its founding? When I came in I thought this would be easier than what I had experienced because it was a start-up. I was absolutely wrong. There were a lot of things that you had to do to get set up with all the procedures and policies and contractors. There were so many things in all the hiring of the staff, and I wore many hats because we started with 20 people and opened three branches right away. We had a very small lending group with four lenders, so it was challenging but very rewarding. I remember the first note that we closed. It was very exciting and very challenging, and I loved it. I had the chance to work with very good people. Eagle has had a lot of challenges over the years, and we’ve gotten through those challenges together. Describe what it was like rising through the ranks as a woman in your career. How are conditions now in CRE banking compared to when you first entered the industry? Now in CRE banking you see a lot of women, and, when you go to the [D.C. Bankers Association] meetings, there are a lot of women there. That was not the way it was in the beginning — there weren’t a lot of women in banking. My Eagle experience has been wonderful because I had a very supportive CEO who encouraged the development of women and allowed me to help develop and encourage other women. I have been fortunate in my career in that I’ve only actually looked for one position, and that was when I first moved to the D.C region. After that I was referred or moved with the chairman and the owners, so I’ve been given a blessing to be honest. I had one gentleman I worked for for 18 years, and every time there was a problem in the bank he would say, “Go look at this problem and see what you could do to fix it,” so I had the opportunity to explore all areas of the bank whether it was in operations or in lending or even the investor side. I had progressive managers that allowed that to happen and didn’t think of me as male or female. They saw the talent that I had and gave me that opportunity. There were also a couple people I worked for who were very difficult managers, but I had a good relationship with them. I think they saw the benefits of women in leadership positions and recognized that I had those skills, and so they were able to help me and give me the opportunities. I’ve been blessed, and paying that back is important. So I would say that I believe that the best people to be put in positions should be the people put in positions. But often women are the best people and they’re often not looked at in that light, so I think I can bring more of that focus to them. I think the industry — and, in general, people — are seeing that women leaders are often more effective. You’re planning this year to “revolutionize” EagleBank’s CRE strategy. What changes are you planning and what was the impetus? EagleBank has been known as a CRE bank as that’s how we started. We’ve been successful and a high performer because of that focus. We don’t ever want to lose that because we have expertise in that area and we are recognized in this industry and market for that expertise. But what we want now is to enhance that. We are skilled in the commercial and industrial [C&I] loan market also, so we want to grow that business, which will allow us to diversify on some of the deposits that we have and will also allow us to increase the fee income because that’s what a C&I business does. We’re also looking at enhancing the consumer as we have a consumer part of our book, but not a strong part. The consumers that we have primarily have been people walking into our branches or business owners that bring their personal accounts and their employees’ accounts to us. We will be looking at enhancing that and moving into a digital presence. We don’t want to lose CRE. There are certainly challenges, but we have a strong team of very seasoned people that know the CRE market. We have one gentleman who has been in the CRE market for over 50 years. When things started to become a problem and when it was obvious to us that there were issues, we immediately pulled that team together. That team is strong, and we will get through this. There will be challenges, but we’ll get through them. I’m proud of the team that we have and proud of how we formed through some very challenging times. Speaking of challenging times, how was EagleBank’s lending portfolio positioned before the Federal Reserve began its aggressive interest rate hikes in early 2022? I think we were positioned well, but we were already thinking of expanding and enhancing that model then because, again, the CRE model has helped us and made us high-performing, and we did well for 25 years. But everything is changing, and we had to diversify and we needed to have stickier deposits. We had already recognized that we needed to begin to change our business model — not lose sight of what made us Eagle and made us the bank we are today, but enhance that with the other areas. Growing in the digital space is something that is new for us and it’s new for a lot of banks, but some banks have been in it for a while. So we just launched our digital expansion. We went in quietly so we’re not really active in it right now, but we have been working on it over the last 12 or 18 months so we’re looking at bringing in some good deposits. We knew we needed to change — or what I prefer to call “enhance our model.” What types of loans are you originating now? In the market right now, with the high interest rates, you don’t have many people wanting to pay those rates. There are some that do, and in instances where we have a customer relationship and they are asking us to do something we do whatever we can. We started the bank with a “relationship first” culture, and we will never lose that. You have been a very active lender in the Washington, D.C., market. How do you see the region shaping up in a post-COVID world given there are many office vacancies in the nation’s capital and many businesses looking toward the suburbs? The entire D.C.-Maryland-Northern Virginia region is a strong market. The inner city in particular is struggling, and a lot of that is due to the fact that the government has a third of the office leases and the federal government is not bringing people back to work. The D.C government has announced that they’ll be bringing people back four days a week. The federal government, although they have tried to do that, are fighting unions. The suburbs are flourishing and you could not get a better market than Northern Virginia, and we are recognized in that area. We did an acquisition of Virginia Heritage Bank back in 2014 to get our name in the Virginia market and we also have the naming rights for George Mason University with EagleBank Arena, so that gets us a lot of publicity, too. Virginia was a hard market to break into and it took us a long time, but we are a strong competitor in the Virginia market, and in Maryland and D.C as well. But there’s lots of growth opportunities, and the political environment in Virginia is more pro business than the political environment in Maryland. How do you view the overall health of the regional banking system after last year’s collapse of three banks and the struggles of New York Community Bank in early 2024? I think that there were a lot of things that happened with Silicon Valley Bank that none of us really know, and they made some big mistakes that caused a ripple throughout the industry. The government is the government, and were they part of that? We lost significant deposits during that time, but I will say our team once again pulled together and we’ve worked through that. I am very proud to say that the deposits we lost were more than recovered at the end of 2023, so we were back in a good position. But we struggled with the regional banking crisis like many did at that time. The industry still has not totally recovered from it. Have you seen a lot of regional bank competitors retreat since interest rates began going up? I think we’re all seeing that. The big banks have stopped lending and it’s the regional banks that are still lending, but cautiously lending. If the borrowers don’t need the money, they’re not looking for it because the interest rates are so high. Now they’re talking about bringing those interest rates down, but I also heard about the possibility of an increase in them, so who knows? No one has a crystal ball, and we will have to just manage through whatever is happening. To close on a lighter note, what do you enjoy doing outside of work? Family. I’m fortunate that I have five children, with three of them within 30 minutes of where I live. One is in Charlotte, which is an hour and half flight, and the other lives 30 minutes from a beach house that I have in Delaware. So I spend whatever time I can with my children, but I’m also involved in outside activities. Eagle is very connected in this community. Our lending team, and even outside of the lending team, does a lot of things out in the community. Eagle has always been recognized for all of that.

       "  'content': 'JOCOTENANGO, Guatemala — On a quiet cobblestone street in a town 90 minutes outside of Guatemala City, class was in session for hundreds of young Guatemalans on a Monday morning. Children in kindergarten through ninth grade moved through the open-air courtyard of the free private school for disadvantaged students, which is run by a global nonprofit group based in Denver. Painted on the wall by its entrance were the Spanish words, “La escuela, la esperanza” — or “The school, the hope.” More than 1,900 miles north of the School of Hope, Denver city officials and residents have grappled for more than a year with accommodating a surge of immigrants — largely from Venezuela — that has stretched city resources. But going back six decades, Guatemala has served as a recurring source of newcomers to the state, with 2022 census data showing Colorado was home to about 7,900 people who had immigrated from the Central American country. While the influx from Venezuela has drawn the most recent attention, Guatemala has long ranked among the top Latin American sources of migrants to the United States; it only fell behind Mexico and Venezuela during the most recent federal fiscal year. Between 2000 and 2021, the number of foreign-born Guatemalans in the U.S. more than tripled to about 1 million, according to the Pew Research Center. To curb migration, two Denver-area nonprofits are taking a hands-on approach in Guatemala. They’re working on the ground to reduce poverty and address other conditions that have spurred many of its citizens to journey to the U.S. Education for the Children Foundation provides at-risk students with free education, meals and mental health services in Jocotenango, aiming to set them up for future success in their own country. Meanwhile, Lakewood-based Friendship Bridge makes business loans to Indigenous women who are entrepreneurs in rural areas, helping them to build lives for themselves and their families. The migrant crisis “is not an issue that can be handled by any one nation, any one state, any one city or any one nonprofit,” said Juan Carlos Franco Orellana, a general case manager at the Denver nonprofit Servicios de La Raza. But, he added, “organizations like those that are putting in that work to improve conditions in Guatemala — I would say, they’re the ones really making headway.” During a visit by a Denver Post reporter to the School of Hope in late February, eighth grader Juan Carlos spoke about his hopes in a country where a student’s future is broadly determined by education. His last name was withheld, at the school’s request, for privacy. He is one of seven siblings, and a brother has already traveled far from home to chase the American dream. But Juan Carlos, 14, aims to graduate and stay in Guatemala to support his family. He first earned pocket change by polishing shoes on the street. Now, after school lets out for the day, he heads to the local market, where his sister sells chicken. He hawks clothing, making a monthly average of 500 to 600 quetzales, the equivalent of $64 to $77. But the budding entrepreneur has plans that transcend market stalls: to get his high school diploma, then pursue a career as either an agronomist or a chef. “I hope that we have a better future here in Guatemala,” Juan Carlos said in Spanish through a translator, while sitting in a classroom. William Gómez, 42, a career counselor at the school, sees himself in the pupils he mentors. His childhood dream was to become a doctor, he said, but his family couldn’t afford that ambition. His father, a widower, worked for decades at a warehouse to support Gómez and three siblings as they grew up in the nearby city of Antigua. At age 10, Gómez helped craft ceramic figurines to sell at the market. Throughout his life, he’s considered migrating to the U.S. in search of job opportunities. But today, Gómez remains in his home country. He’s buoyed, he said in Spanish, by the hope that his students will “be that change that the country and the world needs.” Civil war, corruption and inequality Present-day Guatemala was forged by a tumultuous history, including decades of civil war and corrupt politics, along with extreme economic inequalities. Significant numbers of residents have left the country to escape those conflicts and pressures — including immigrants who established longstanding Guatemalan communities in Alamosa and Denver. “This is a country that was really built on a base of inequality,” said Regina Bateson, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Colorado Boulder. “The problem is not a sheer lack of wealth. The problem is the distribution of that wealth.” In a nation where about half of the population identifies as Indigenous — the Maya are the largest Native community — those citizens are overwhelmingly impacted by racial prejudice and poverty. The injustices date back centuries, with many Indigenous Guatemalans forced into agricultural labor through debt servitude in the 19th century. The mounting systemic problems exploded into the Guatemalan Civil War in 1960. As the federal military and leftist guerrillas fought for 36 years, more than 200,000 Guatemalans died — most of them Indigenous. The violence drove survivors from their homes. While the war ended in 1996 with a peace accord, “a lot of the issues that caused the civil war remained unresolved,” Bateson said. Today, hundreds of Indigenous families from the municipality of Santa Eulalia in western Guatemala reside in Colorado’s San Luis Valley. Generations have called it home since migrants began resettling there in the 1980s. Father Carlos Alvarez of Alamosa’s Sacred Heart Church said the mountainous region reminded the newcomers of Guatemala, with the church and the mushroom farm — long the immigrants’ largest local employer — serving as community focal points. Many of the Guatemalans who first moved to the valley were originally seeking asylum in the U.S. A group of churches established the San Luis Valley Immigrant Resource Center to remedy the absence of immigration attorneys in the area, said executive director Flora Archuleta. Its team has since helped immigrants prepare their work authorization paperwork and renew their green cards. The parents of Marisol Cristobal-Lucas, 27, came to Alamosa in one of the waves of migration. During Guatemala’s civil war, her father, Lucas Francisco Lucas, was one of the young Mayan men picked up at random by militants and trained for months in guerrilla warfare. In 1986, he crossed the southwestern U.S. desert as an undocumented immigrant to work on the mushroom farm in Colorado with his brother. “It was a good opportunity for them to make good money,” Cristobal-Lucas said. Her mother, Eulalia Cristobal Sebastian, joined her father around 1993. Both had initially expected their stay in the U.S. to be temporary as they saved money. But Cristobal-Lucas said her father eventually became a U.S. citizen through programs set in motion by a Reagan-era amnesty law, and her mother secured a green card. Decades later, Servicios de La Raza’s Orellana said, back in Guatemala, “economically, things are still very hard.” Even blue-collar industries, such as construction, don’t offer the same opportunities as in the U.S. because Guatemala isn’t building infrastructure as quickly, said Orellana, who was born in Guatemala City. Although the country is home to Central America’s largest economy, with its gross domestic product valued at $95 billion in 2022, according to the World Bank, over half of the population lives in poverty. Guatemalans are pushing to reduce government corruption, but Bateson, the CU professor, called domestic politics “pretty complicated,” with elected leaders prone to self-enrichment and involvement with organized crime. “It’s one of the most unstable party systems in the world,” she said. Still, despite Guatemala’s challenges, Vivi Lemus is among immigrants here who work to counter negative perceptions about their homeland. She is a co-owner of Convivio Café, a bilingual coffee shop in northwest Denver, and has now lived in Colorado with her husband for more than 20 years. “You hear corruption, you hear occupation and you hear all the strife,” said Lemus, 48. “You seldom hear about the hospitality, the kindness, the beauty of people, the flavors, the amazing Mayan culture that extends centuries — and the wisdom that is my heritage.” School’s goal is for students “to stay here in Guatemala” With its focus on improving conditions for Guatemalans, Denver-based Education for the Children Foundation began as a scholarship program two decades ago. In 2005, it expanded to open the School of Hope in Jocotenango, with 80 pupils at its start. The student body has since quintupled to 400, with a staff of about 60 employees. Every year, the school accepts 40 or so new students, usually of kindergarten age. “We never advertise, because we have too much demand,” said Sara Miller, the nonprofit’s U.S. executive director. Instead, the pupils’ parents often first learn about the school through word of mouth. About 25% of those parents are illiterate, with the majority having only reached sixth grade in their education, Miller said. Because entry-level jobs often require at least a high school education, unlearned Guatemalans tend to earn a living in the country’s informal economy. The majority of the nation’s working population — 68% of men and 76% of women — tried to make money informally in 2021, says a report by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Miller said her students’ fathers often work as bus drivers and construction workers, while their mothers are paid to make tortillas, clean houses and iron clothes. She estimates that the families earn the equivalent of $200 to $300 per month. Today, evidence of Guatemala’s wealth inequalities is readily apparent. While luxury apartment buildings tower over Guatemala City, to the west in Jocotenango, a shantytown of illegally built homes rises up the hillside of La Vista Hermosa — a makeshift community where about 150 School of Hope families live as squatters, Miller said. The municipal land isn’t zoned for housing because it’s prone to landslides, but residents accept the risk to avoid paying rent. The cobblestone path winding through the neighborhood was traversed by family members picking up their children from the nearby public school. Then, they hopped on motorcycles or into three-wheeled vehicles called tuk-tuks — both cheap modes of transportation in Guatemala. Across from a soccer field, a mural painted on a wall urged “la no violencia,” or nonviolence. The public education system is free, but is “really underfunded,” Miller said, with 60 students crammed into a classroom for just three or four hours of instruction per day. So, some parents opt to enroll their children in private school, though costs quickly add up for school supplies, uniforms and more. The School of Hope helps ease those financial burdens by offering high-quality education at no cost to its students. Aracely Chajón, director of the school’s social services programs, said the students’ families still deal with socioeconomic problems, sometimes resulting in violence, alcoholism and absentee parenting in households. Chajón, 39, said in Spanish that “a very beautiful part of the foundation is to volunteer a place where (students) feel they have the confidence” and the trust to express themselves openly at school. There, “someone listens to them.” During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chajón and Miller watched as several of the school’s pupils left Guatemala, with 10 immigrating as unaccompanied minors to the U.S. to join relatives. But other students decided to remain in the country because they wanted to graduate. The majority returned to school when viral outbreaks eased, Miller said. “Our goal is for them to stay here in Guatemala,” she said. She hopes to open both a preschool and a high school. The foundation plans to construct another building, which will cost $1 million; it’s raised $500,000 for the project so far. “Through education and access to opportunities, (students) can find a good job in Guatemala and be able to support themselves,” Miller said. “Their children will grow up in a very different environment.” Entrepreneurship offers women new opportunities Since Friendship Bridge launched its Guatemala operation in 1998, the Lakewood nonprofit has focused on offering a lifeline through business. It largely supports Indigenous women entrepreneurs by providing business training, individual loans, group lending and education on topics, such as women’s rights. Because of the dearth of medical care in rural Guatemala, the nonprofit also offers health services. More than two decades after its start, Friendship Bridge now serves about 35,000 clients — women who typically come from impoverished communities and share the task of taking care of large families, said Indira Maldonado, the organization’s communications and visual design coordinator. But they often find themselves stuck in “a cycle of the poverty,” she added. Maldonado, 25, places much of the blame on her country’s machismo-inflected culture, which fosters violence, alcoholism and other problems. “In this culture of machismo, it’s really hard for women to have their own voice,” she said. So, the nonprofit seeks to empower women because, “when you give to women, they invest everything for their families,” Maldonado said. Lidia Par Puzul, 37, usually creates her goods at home, shaded under a roof of blue tarp and tin, in the small town of Cipresales in the country’s western highlands. But during The Post’s visit in late February, she demonstrated the art of beading at Friendship Bridge’s Guatemala headquarters in Panajachel. Her wares — Christmas ornaments, chunky necklaces and animal figurines of various colors and sizes — were spread out on the table in front of her as she threaded minuscule beads onto a needle and pulled, working toward the final product: a red bracelet. Like other Mayan women, she wore the traditional outfit of a corte (skirt), huipil (blouse) and faja (belt). She said she knew how to embroider beads on shirts, too. Par Puzul learned how to make handicrafts at 8 years old — a skill taught by her father, who sold them around the country. Saddled with the responsibility of helping her family as the eldest daughter, she dropped out of school after finishing fourth grade. Her mother, also a craftswoman, secured her first loan of 500 quetzales, or about $64 in today’s money, through Friendship Bridge. Par Puzul joined as a young adult and has received several loans herself. She used the money to grow her handicraft shop in Panajachel, which she ran with her husband, José Ibate. She became an artisan in the Handmade by Friendship Bridge program, with the nonprofit selling her products in its online store. In 2017, thieves robbed the couple of materials, products and other items worth about 300,000 quetzales, or $38,414. José Ibate debated immigrating to the U.S. to earn money for the family. But because of Par Puzul’s work with Friendship Bridge, her spouse stayed in Guatemala to rebuild their business together. A mother herself, Par Puzul said in Spanish that, even though school costs a lot of money, “what I want is for my daughters to study, and that is the most important thing.” Saida Perez, 51, is also a businesswoman from Guatemala. But “my story is not very reflective to a lot of my conationals,” she said. Growing up in Guatemala City, “I was a privileged kid that was able to go to a private school,” Perez added. In 1989, she moved to the U.S. with the proper paperwork and is now an American citizen. Perez, who lives in Thornton, runs her own insurance agency and caters to the local Latino community, especially youth and women. As the founder of Alianza Migrante Guatemalteca, or the Guatemalan Immigrant Alliance, she’s one of the advocates behind the establishment of Denver’s Guatemalan consulate in 2004 and the 2013 passage by the state legislature of the Colorado Road and Community Safety Act. That law allows all qualifying Colorado residents — including undocumented immigrants and refugees — to obtain standard driver’s licenses or ID cards. “It’s a challenge to live outside your country, and to keep traditions and to keep the culture and to be represented,” Perez said. “I am always going for more — trying for Guatemalans to have a voice.” Nearly 2,000 miles away, the local teams of Friendship Bridge and Education for the Children Foundation also try to keep attuned to the voices of Guatemalans as they work to improve their lives, year after year. To Maldonado, nonprofits like Friendship Bridge “support this vision for women to have better futures, and the next generations to have better futures.” As a country, she said, “we’re growing — maybe with tiny steps, but we’re growing.”',\n",

       "  'content': 'Nonbank mortgage originator Change Lending will become a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB-SF). The Anaheim, California-based originator’s application was approved on Wednesday after it fulfilled all statutory requirements for membership, including those related to capital, profitability and liquidity, the company reported. Change’s membership will become effective upon its acquisition of the required $7 million capital stock in the FHLB-SF. The transaction is expected to close in May. “We welcome a partnership with the FHLB-SF to enhance our strength and reach as America’s CDFI,” said Steven Sugarman, founder of the Change Company, the parent company of Change Lending. “We are excited to expand our impact and better serve our target market borrowers.” Change is a community development financial institution (CDFI) that is certified by the U.S. Treasury Department, given to specialized organizations that provide financial services to low-income communities and others who lack financing options. Change and the Treasury Department went through a short-lived legal dispute after the lender sued the CDFI Fund for its “flawed analysis and mathematical errors,” leading to a decertification of Change Lending. The Treasury Department renewed the certification in February following a settlement agreement in November 2023. Change Lending’s services include small-business loans and lines of credit, investor real estate loans, rehab loans and renovation loans, according to its website. Since becoming a CDFI in 2018, Change has funded more than $25 billion in loans to more than 75,000 borrowers, the lender reported. Last year, Change Lending ranked as the top nonqualified mortgage (non-QM) originator, posting $4.1 billion in 2022 production volume, per Scotsman Guide.',\n",

Change Lending, LLC, a community development financial institution (CDFI), announced that the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB-SF) has approved its application for membership. The non-bank lender has 60 days to fund the required capital stock purchase, which will be around $7 million, and expects the transaction to close in May. The decision comes after Change met all statutory requirements, including capital, profitability, and liquidity standards. \"Change Lending is proud to become a member of the FHLB-SF,\" founder of the Change Company Steven Sugarman said. \"We welcome a partnership with the FHLB-SF to enhance our strength and reach as America’s CDFI. We are excited to expand our impact and better serve our target market borrowers.\" Change Lending, along with its parent, The Change Company, hold certification from the U.S. Department of the Treasury as CDFIs. That status was threatened in 2023. Since then the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\'s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund renewed Change\\'s CDFI Certification in February 2024. Get the NMP Daily Essential stories, every weekday. Change says it has focused on providing home loans to underserved, prime homeowners, with a significant emphasis on supporting Black, Latino, and low-income borrowers, as well as those residing in low-income communities. \"We are pleased with the decision of the FHFA and FHLB-SF to approve Change’s application for membership in the FHLB-SF. We look forward to working in partnership with the FHLB-SF to bring greater equity to homeownership,\" stated Rev. Everett Bell, Jr., chair of Change\\'s Community Advisory Board. Change\\'s approval for FHLB-SF membership highlights its position as America’s largest Non-QM lender and the first non-bank CDFI to achieve a AAA-rating on its residential mortgage loan securitizations.

       "  'content': 'The Harbor Bank of Maryland has partnered with digital account onboarding specialist Prelim. Courtesy of the partnership, the Baltimore, Maryland-based financial institution will leverage Prelim’s technology and expertise to enhance its account opening services. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Prelim made its Finovate debut at FinovateSpring 2022. Digital account onboarding specialist Prelim and the Harbor Bank of Maryland have teamed up to bring digital account opening services to the customers of the Baltimore, Maryland-based financial institution. Founded in 1982 with $2.1 million in assets, Harbor Bank of Maryland serves the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area with seven branch locations and a loan office in Silver Spring, Maryland. The bank offers a wide variety of banking services, including checking, savings, time deposits, credit and debit cards, and commercial real estate, as well as personal, home improvement, and other installment and term loans. With total assets of $377 million, Harbor Bank of Maryland is a designated Minority Depository Institution (MDI) and the first community bank in the U.S. to have an investment subsidiary, Harbor Financial Services. San Francisco, California-based Prelim made its Finovate debut at FinovateSpring in 2022 and returned again the following year for FinovateSpring 2023. Co-founded in 2017 by Heang Chan (CEO) and Chris Blaser (CTO), Prelim offers a white-label platform that empowers banks to digitize their business banking operations. Via API, Prelim enables financial institutions to automate their business account onboarding, as well as connect to third party providers to meet AML, BSA, and CIP requirements. The platform also helps FIs launch other financial services and banking products from lending to merchant services. In addition to its partnership with the Harbor Bank of Maryland, Prelim last month announced a collaboration with Movement Bank. Headquartered in Danville, Virginia, Movement Bank was launched in 1919 by a team of African American doctors, teachers, farmers, and preachers. From humble origins in a church basement and $6,500 in capital, the financial institution has grown into a major community resource. The bank was among the first to reopen during the Great Depression after banks were forced to close. The institution was also one of the first banks in Virginia to issue Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans back in 1934. Movement Bank currently has $150 million in total assets.

       "  'content': 'Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin During the last week in March, there were several significant foreclosures (hundreds of millions of dollars per property). They included properties in San Francisco and Mountain View, CA, a large complex in Washington, D.C., and a medical office building (still under construction) in the southern part of Florida. YoY Change in National Rent Index (2019-Present) Apartment List Leveraged loan delinquencies now exceed 6% (normal is <3%). This level is approaching the levels seen in the ’01, ’08, and ’20 Recessions. According to Moody’s, office vacancies are at record highs. Commercial Real Estate (CRE) prices are in freefall. According to Rosenberg Research, 29% of all CRE, and 56% of office loans now have negative equity. Retail malls are struggling, and the multi-family space is overbuilt (falling rents). It will be informative to see the additions to their loan loss reserves as banks post their Q1 results in April. Equity Markets Yet, despite the growing problems in the CRE sector and cracks appearing in the economic landscape, equity prices continue to scale new heights. The S&P 500 and the DJIA both hit record closing highs on Thursday (March 28), with the Nasdaq a hair’s breadth away from its record closing high of March 22nd. The equity market continues to be driven by momentum, and traditional valuation metrics, like the PE (Price/Earnings) Ratio are significantly above their median values (see chart below). PE Ratio for S&P 500: 29.00 Gurufocus Cracks in the Foundation Meanwhile, over the past quarter or so, we’ve seen flat to falling Industrial Production, lower retail sales volumes, shrinking exports, flat to negative capital spending, and a net loss of full-time jobs (being replaced by part-time ones). Yet, in the face of this data, both the Atlanta and St. Louis Federal Reserve District Banks are forecasting a stunning +2.3% growth rate for Q1 GDP. This appears to be extremely optimistic. In addition, the media is still touting “the economy is strong” mantra. We think the growth is much lower, as do many research houses. Rosenberg Research, for example, is projecting -0.5% Q1 GDP growth based on the trends in the following data over the past three months: MORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR Best Tax Software Of 2022 Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022 Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes Industrial Production (-2,7% Annual Rate (AR AR )) Retail Sales volume (-5.3% AR) Core CORE Capex Orders (-0.9% AR) Exports (-1.1% AR) Full-Time employment (-5.2% AR) In addition, Rosenberg reports that same store sale have contracted in dollar terms (-0.2% year over year). Worse, when adjusted for inflation (i.e. looking at volumes), that number becomes a negative (-1.3%) and has been negative for five quarters in a row. That was last seen in the Great Recession (see chart below). Furthermore, if we look at Wall Street’s earnings growth estimates for Q2, these are flat as a pancake, and we have the major retailers (TGT, HD, LOW, WMT) all commenting in their Q4 earnings calls that consumers have tightened their purse strings. The latest retail reports from the likes of Lululemon and Nike NKE were also downbeat as both reported disappointing sales, softening demand, and slower traffic. Volume Growth at Consumer Businesses Bloomberg, Rosenberg Research In past blogs, we’ve commented on the rapid rise in credit card balances. That’s because personal savings have been depleted. And now we are seeing rapidly rising credit card, auto loan, and other consumer loan delinquencies. Consumer Loans: Delinquency Rate Universal Value Advisors Home Prices and the “Wealth Effect” Rising home prices often lead to what economists call the “wealth effect.” That is, when home prices rise, homeowners tend to spend more because they feel they can afford higher consumption as their “wealth” is higher. That particular effect is now waning. Both the Case-Shiller and the FHFA Home Price Indexes are displaying steep negative slopes with the FHFA Index already in negative territory. The housing boom may very well be ending. S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index; FHFA House Price Index Universal Value Advisors The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell in March with the Future Expectations sub-index now at a six-month low. Less than 15% of those surveyed see the economy improving in the next six-months, while plans to purchase a car or major home appliance were the weakest since July ’22, and September ’11 before that. Growth Forecasts While the mothership Fed recently raised its GDP growth forecast for 2024 from 1.4% to 2.1% and lowered its U3 Unemployment Level at year’s end to 4.0% from 4.1%, reports from the Fed’s Regional District Banks aren’t as sanguine. The Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing Index showed up as -14.4 in March, even lower than February’s -11.3. Production, New Orders, and Shipments were negative and the workweek contracted. The Dallas Fed’s Services Index was also weak at -5.0; again lower than in February (-3.9). The Philly Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index, at -18.3 in March, has now shown contraction for three months in a row. New Orders, Backlogs, and Inventories all shrank. And full-time job growth was the lowest since last June. The Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index was also negative in March (-11), and, again, worse than the -5 reading in February. This marked the sixth month in a row of contraction. Negatives were seen in in the indexes for New Orders, Capacity Utilization, and Backlogs. In addition, Business Spending was the most contractionary since July ’20. The chart shows the Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index. This comprehensive index has been in negative terrain since Q4 ’22. Chicago Fed National Activity Index Universal Value Advisors The Fed and Interest Rates Chairman Powell and other FOMC members continue to insist that they need to see more “good” inflation data before embarking on a lowering rate agenda. We had some bumps in the road on the disinflation path in January and February. At his recent press conference after the Fed’s latest meeting, the Chairman eased market angst, saying that the Fed would not overreact to the hotter than anticipated January and February inflation data. On Friday (March 29th), the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index (PCE) printed a +0.3% number (+0.332% to the third decimal), down slightly from January’s +0.4% (+0.376%). Nevertheless, due to “base effects,” the year over year rate (2.45%) ticked up slightly from January’s 2.43%, the first uptick in quite some time, but ever so slight. As inflation falls to target, statistically, such deviations can be expected. The core PCE measure, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, also rose 0.3% in February, and 2.8% on the year over year measure, down slightly from 2.9% in January. The PCE report won’t do anything to change FOMC views that the last part of the inflation fight will take a little longer. As seen from the chart below, the Core PCE Price Deflator is lower than the Core CPI Index. That’s good news as that is the index to which the Fed reacts. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index Yahoo! Finance On Friday (April 5th), the CPI for March will be announced. As we have discussed in past blogs, our view is that the lagged shelter component in the CPI will be de-escalating the annual rate of CPI inflation through year’s end. Markets apparently agree with this assessment, as the odds of a June rate cut have now climbed to as high as 70%. The June 11-12 Fed meeting is still nearly two and a half months away. A lot can and will happen in this interim. Final Thoughts CRE issues are mounting, and foreclosures are in their early stages. We expect large impacts on the financial sector over the next several months. This alone will throw the economy into Recession. Banks’ loan loss provisions in their upcoming Q1 financial reports will shed a lot of light on this topic. Despite growing cracks in the economy, the equities market continues to hit record high closing prices. Traditional valuation metrics strongly suggest that equities are in overvaluation territory. Cracks in non-financial sectors also continue to appear. Manufacturing looks to already be in Recession, and the Consumer, who has driven this economy for the last several quarters, appears to now be out of gas. While the Fed recently raised its 2024 GDP forecast and lowed its year end unemployment rate prediction, emerging data show weakening retail sales, production and housing. The Regional Fed Bank surveys suggest the same. Despite the January/February upticks, all the other measures continue to show disinflation (slowing rates of inflation). Instead of the “bumps in the road” making Fed Chair Powell more hawkish, he surprised markets at his recent press conference by assuring them that the inflation fight was being won. We agree with that assessment. Due to the lag in shelter data built into the CPI, significantly lower inflation (i.e., disinflation) is all but guaranteed. Thus, the odds of a June rate cut now appear to be significant. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.) Follow me on Twitter. Check out my website.

       "  'content': \"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Zain Jaffer is the founder and president of Zain Ventures, a family office that invests in real estate and proptech. getty In late January 2024, four U.S. Senators, namely Elizabeth Warren, John Hickenlooper, Jacky Rosen and Sheldon Whitehouse, wrote to U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell urging him to cut interest rates. “As the Fed weighs its next steps in the new year, we urge you to consider the effects of your interest rate decisions on the housing market,” the senators wrote. “The direct effect of these astronomical rates has been a significant increase in the overall home purchasing cost to the average consumer,” they added. The U.S. housing market is virtually frozen, save for a few buyers and sellers who absolutely need to buy or sell and move elsewhere for various personal reasons. Although mortgage rates in early January lowered a bit to around 6.7%, the average rate reached as high as 7.8% in mid-October 2023. In November 2020, it was around 2.7%, which is a difference of around 5%. The problem is that inflation is not yet under the Fed's target 2% goal. In 2020, it was around 1.2%, but the cash infusion into the economy during the pandemic helped push it to 8% in 2022. Not making debt expensive through rate hikes would have meant risking hyperinflation, which could have serious consequences. The Fed has two tools to fight it: Quantitative tightening means that they no longer buy treasury bonds and bills and mortgage backed securities (MBS) from banks so in effect they have less cash to lend out, and higher interest rates, meaning the banks need to raise the lending rate to their clients because the money they borrow from the Fed is now more expensive. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor How are high interest rates affecting the real estate sector? To say that high interest rates have decimated the real estate sector is an understatement. Many real estate projects are financed largely with debt, with just a little equity from the developer. The housing market is negatively impacted, but so is office and retail commercial real estate space, particularly in large cities where there is a lot of competition. Although Class A properties are still doing relatively okay because big companies and high-end professional offices want slick, cool office spaces to entice their workforce and impress their clients, I've noticed the older non-ESG-compliant office buildings are not doing so well. Many workers prefer to work from home (WFH), assuming they have not been laid off because of poor economic conditions or that artificial intelligence (AI) hasn’t replaced them yet. On the bright side, parking lots and warehouses are still doing okay, especially since online retail is quite popular. The situation is so bad that I hear of established developers doing a firesale on their offices in places like San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles just to offload some of these properties off their books. They realize that at high interest rates, the math on these investments no longer works. Then there is also the mountain of corporate debt that had originally been lent at low interest rates to companies for their operations and capex prior to the Fed hikes. Many companies are already struggling to meet their monthly payments, and now, with their loans maturing, they need to renegotiate with their bank or lender at higher rates. For some of them, they will need to throw in the towel if expected inflows will not meet contractual outflow needs. For businesses, the goal is to survive. At this point, the question is no longer how to make lots of money for some businesses. For many, their goal right now is to simply survive until the interest rates go lower, when they feel they can pay off the new renegotiated loans with what they predict will lower cash inflows or revenues to their businesses. If you are running a business, you may have talked to your banker about renegotiating your loan so that you do not miss payments. This may mean adding more years to the repayment period, but the alternative is to default on the loan—within reason, of course. If the project no longer makes sense, such as an office project that is mostly vacant, you may need to find a buyer for the property or turn that business into something else. Aside from talking to your banker (or lender) about restructuring your debt to be easier to service, you also need to go all out on your sales efforts. This is the time for creative marketing strategies and for your sales team to really hit and exceed their quotas. Making sure your debt servicing can be met with your inflows is essential for making it through. Surviving to fight for another day is not just a saying for you. It is what you need to do.

       "  'content': 'By Ann Saphir, Saeed Azhar and Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) - U.S. regional lenders face ongoing challenges from rising deposit costs and risky office-building loans a year after the biggest bank failures since 2008. The unexpected collapses of three banks - Silicon Valley and Signature in March 2023 and First Republic in May - put a spotlight on how lenders managed risks to assets and liquidity as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to bring surging inflation under control. Now that the Fed has stopped raising rates but has signaled cuts may not come for another several months, investors have shifted their focus to the potential for customers to pull their deposits in times of stress, while gauging lenders\\' exposure to the troubled commercial real estate (CRE) sector. \"The banking industry needs to make sure it has a strong hold on its access to liquidity, conduct in-depth deposit stress testing, and ensure it can withstand significant stress,\" said Ryan Nash, banking analyst at Goldman Sachs. \"This is something that all banks will need to plan for in the world ahead.” The tumult prompted emergency government measures to stabilize the sector alongside downgrades by credit rating agencies. In recent weeks, New York Community Bancorp has fueled market jitters about renewed weakness in the sector after it disclosed major losses and warned of material weakness in its internal controls. \"Last year’s bank stress underscores the importance of not becoming complacent,\" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in New York City last week, noting that the bank failures were due not just to poor risk management but also to weaknesses in supervision. The following graphics show the impact of Silicon Valley Bank\\'s (SVB) collapse on the industry, one year after its March 10 failure. In its immediate aftermath, business lending plunged and banks pulled back on credit more broadly. In recent months, both measures have improved, but are still below year-ago levels. Commercial lending has bumped along in recent months, barely regaining lost ground after SVB\\'s failure. Regional banks have relatively large exposure to CRE loans, compared with larger peers that have more diversified portfolios. Lenders are under pressure to write down their losses from CRE as offices remain sparsely populated by workers on hybrid or remote work arrangements. Growth in CRE lending slowed dramatically after SVB\\'s failure and continued to decelerate through the year. Loans by regional and community banks, which account for the bulk of CRE lending, are still above last year, but the biggest banks have trimmed their CRE loan portfolios. Recent Boston Fed research suggests that, even so, it may be the biggest banks that are more vulnerable to CRE losses, with 40% of their office building loans in counties with a high share of work-from home, versus 30% for smaller banks. The turmoil of March 2023 triggered \"stress for most, crisis for a few\" banks, said Christopher Wolfe, head of North American Banks ratings at Fitch. It highlighted the importance of banks maintaining solid insured and operational deposits to underpin their funding. \"The banks most caught out were material outliers,\" in terms of their sources of deposits, he said. Depositors fled smaller U.S. lenders for the safety of bigger institutions after SVB failed, but some funds have since flowed back. Overall deposits in banks of all sizes are down compared with a year earlier as households have spent their savings or chased higher returns in money markets or rallying equities. More than 90% of Silicon Valley Bank\\'s deposits were not insured by a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp guarantee, which covers at least $250,000 in deposit accounts. SVB\\'s uninsured deposits stood at twice the average of its peers. It was toppled after clients who were concerned about the bank\\'s health pulled their money, regulators found. Since last year, the proportion of uninsured deposits in the industry has declined, FDIC data shows. \"When your customer deposit base is making big withdrawals over the short term, it will definitely cause a liquidity squeeze,\" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at Argus Research. \"No amount of capital levels will be able to save a bank that has 40% of their deposits leave in 24-48 hours.\" Investors generally expect regional bank stocks to be more volatile than stocks of bigger banks and larger financial institutions. For this reason, there tends to be a gap between the implied volatility of regional stocks and larger banks. This gap, which widened sharply during the March turmoil, has not gone back to pre-crisis levels. The spread reflects investors\\' lingering perception that regional banks are a less safe bet than bigger lenders. \"The risks facing regional banks right now would be an environment of higher-for-longer rates,\" said Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer of Treasury Partners. As banks pay more to retain customer deposits, the money they earn from interest payments is eroded, he said, referring to a measure called net interest margin. Saperstein expects more banks to set aside reserves for potential losses on CRE loans, particularly related to offices. He also predicts ratings agencies will continue to downgrade regional lenders. Regional banks in particular saw a decline in net interest income as they had to pay more to depositors versus larger peers while demand from borrowers stays subdued. The stocks of regional lenders were hit when SVB\\'s troubles first emerged, and have lagged the overall U.S. equity market over the past year. The KBW Regional Banking index has slumped roughly 12% since the banking issues first flared in March 2023, while the S&P 500 - the benchmark for the U.S. stock market - has gained 28% in that time, fueled by huge gains for megacap technology and growth stocks. The S&P 500 banks index, which includes major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, has fared better, rising some 12% over the past year, though still trailing the overall S&P 500.

       "  'content': 'Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) collapse was one of the largest banking failures in American history. And according to a report Tuesday (March 12) by Bloomberg News, that collapse brought with it the largest penalty since before the 2008 financial crisis: $285 million in fees to retire emergency financing the lender had gotten from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system. The report, citing an internal Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) document obtained by Bloomberg, said that SVB had received billions in financing in an eleventh-hour effort to withstand the run on deposits that led to its seizure by regulators. The FHLB system was established during the Great Depression to back mortgage lending. In addition to SVB, two other lenders that went out of business last year — Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank — had also borrowed billions from the program. SVB and Signature both collapsed within days of each other last March, the same week that saw Silvergate voluntarily close its doors. Elliot Sloane, a spokesman for the San Francisco FHLB, which floated the money to SVB, told Bloomberg the bank “worked diligently and urgently to provide critical liquidity to Silicon Valley Bank in the days prior to its failure.” When SVB went under, the FHLB was within its rights to recall its money but chose not to do so, said Sloane. Instead, the bridge bank that took over SVB moved to repay the advances early and take on the cost laid out in the contract, thus getting full control of SVB’s assets that had been pledged as collateral to the home-loan bank. Marking the one-year anniversary of the SVB collapse earlier this week, PYMNTS wrote that the lessons of its failure extend beyond the world of regional banking. “In a fundamental shift in the corporate world, a dozen CFOs noted to PYMNTS in a series of interviews that CFOs are now tasked with managing liquidity levels and cash availability at the board, management and even employee levels,” that report said. “They’ve been crafting bank-risk frameworks and looking toward vendor and third-party risks, where financial supply chains are at least as important as all other business relationships.” What’s not known, that report added, is whether those new measures will be enough. Bank runs look a lot different than they used to, PYMNTS wrote, and the “only certainty is that the banking system will be tested again.”',\n",

       "  'content': \"Quiver Quantitative - The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year came with a hefty price tag, not just for the bank itself, but also for the US banking system at large. A crucial yet overlooked aspect of SVB's collapse was the $285 million in fees charged for prematurely ending emergency financing from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system. This fee, necessary to retire billions in financing obtained by SVB in a desperate bid to survive a run on deposits, is the largest of its kind for any bank failure since before the 2008 financial crisis. This situation highlights the significant role of FHLBs in providing emergency lending, even to banks that eventually fail, and brings into focus the ongoing debate in Washington about reforming this Depression-era system initially designed to finance mortgage lending. In the wake of this incident, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the home-loan banks, is considering revising the rules regarding prepayment fees. The rationale behind allowing FHLBs to charge such fees, even from failing borrowers, is to let these institutions recoup the costs associated with retiring the debt, ensuring their financial stability. However, these fees also stoke the debate over the appropriate use of FHLBs in the modern banking landscape, especially concerning their support to struggling banks. The SVB incident, where the FHLB of San Francisco provided $30 billion in emergency financing, underscores the significant reliance of banks on the FHLB system for more than just mortgage financing. Market Overview: -FHLB System Scrutinized: The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) raises questions about the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system's practices, particularly regarding fees charged for early repayment of emergency financing. -Record Fee Charged: A $285 million fee levied against SVB for early repayment is the largest of its kind for a failed bank since before 2006. -Reform Debate Ignited: This incident fuels discussions about potential reforms to the FHLB system, with concerns about profit prioritization over responsible lending practices. -Focus on Core Mission: Consumer advocates urge the FHLB system to return to its original purpose of supporting mortgage lending, rather than acting as a general source of liquidity for failing institutions. Key Points: -Record Fee for FHLB: The $285 million fee charged to SVB for early repayment of emergency financing is the largest on record for a failed bank since at least 2006. -Reform Debate: This incident fuels the debate surrounding FHLB practices, with concerns about the system's prioritization of profit over responsible lending practices. -Prepayment Fee Impact: The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is considering rule changes regarding prepayment fees, aiming to encourage FHLBs to conduct more thorough assessments before offering substantial financing to struggling institutions. -FHLB Defense: The Council of Federal Home Loan Banks argues that these fees compensate the institutions for costs incurred when unwinding financing agreements. -Focus on Core Function: Consumer advocates urge the FHLB system to refocus on its core mission of supporting mortgage lending, rather than serving as a general source of liquidity for failing banks. Looking Ahead: -The FHFA's potential rule changes regarding prepayment fees will be closely monitored to see if they address concerns about FHLB practices. -The broader debate about the FHLB system's role and its adherence to its original mission is likely to continue. SVB's decision to pay back the FHLB financing early, along with the hefty fees, was a critical move in managing the bank's collapse. This action allowed full control of SVB's assets, which had been pledged as collateral to the home-loan bank. Silicon Valley Bank was ultimately acquired by First Citizens BancShares, which continues to use the SVB brand. This scenario is part of a broader trend where numerous banks, amidst last year's financial turmoil, chose to repay their FHLB advances early, incurring penalties. The FHLB system loaned out approximately $676 billion in a single week at the peak of the crisis, demonstrating its vital role in stabilizing the banking industry. The incident with SVB and the subsequent fees charged by FHLB reveal the evolving role of these institutions in the modern financial system. While FHLBs were originally created to support housing finance, their function has expanded significantly, often being utilized as a convenient source of liquidity for financial firms for various purposes. The reliance on FHLBs for emergency funding and the associated penalties in cases of early repayment raise questions about the broader use of these banks and their role in addressing financial crises and housing issues. The debate over FHLB reform and the proper scope of their activities continues to be a pressing issue in the US financial regulatory landscape.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'The date was September 22, 1957. Just one week after his landslide reelection to a third term as West Germany’s chancellor, Konrad Adenauer was the guest on CBS’s Face the Nation in a special television broadcast from Germany. The network’s Bonn bureau chief came right out and asked him: “Next January you will be 82 years old. By the time your term has run its course, you will be in your 86th year. Do you really want to continue working at this hard job that long?” Adenauer allowed a faint smile. Through an interpreter, he answered that when Pope Leo XIII turned 90, the dean of the Vatican diplomatic corps had congratulated the pontiff and expressed a wish that he should reach 100. Adenauer, who was Catholic, added, with a twinkle in his eye, “The Pope replied to the dean: ‘But why should you want to set any limits to divine grace?’ I reply the same to you!” The polls today show that many voters regard Joe Biden as too old or enfeebled to serve another four-year term. How can anyone know whether someone that age will be up for the demands of the Oval Office? Yet the life of Konrad Adenauer (1876–1967) proves that a dedicated head of state can not only serve robustly at an advanced age, despite periodic illnesses and public criticism, but can be transformative and make history. Like President Biden, Adenauer was repeatedly accused of senility. He occasionally tumbled in public. His political obituary was written up in the press numerous times. Yet he served in the West German government as an extremely competent head of state, vigorous and active, into his ninth decade. When Adenauer was first elected chancellor of the newly formed Federal Republic of (West) Germany in 1949, he was 73 and widely regarded as a caretaker, too old for lengthy service in office. He even announced before the vote that his doctor had given him the all clear for another two years. Octogenarians who still went to work were far rarer then than today. Adenauer was so old that he had first been a leading candidate for chancellor back in the late 1920s. Yet he ended up being reelected three times (in a 1956 Gallup poll, 75 percent of the electorate “recognized his achievements”) and served until he resigned in the middle of his fourth term in 1963. Age 87 at that time, he continued in office as head of the Christian Democratic Union party until he was 90. The West German public referred to him as Der Alte (roughly, “the old guy”). Der Alte, who had never even traveled to Washington, Rome, or Paris until he was 75, almost single-handedly transformed a bombed-out, impoverished, and reviled rogue nation into a civilized democracy and economic powerhouse, repaired the century-old rift with France, and became the chief architect of the continent’s Euro-federation model that has held firm for 75 years. In an address to the House of Commons on May 11, 1953, Winston Churchill praised Adenauer as “the wisest German statesman since the days of Bismarck.” There are several surprising parallels between Joe Biden and Konrad Adenauer. Both had to overcome chronic impediments from their youth (Biden’s stutter, Adenauer’s weak lungs). Appointed lord mayor of Cologne in 1917, Adenauer was the youngest municipal leader in Prussia, just as Joe Biden at 29 was the youngest U.S. Senator in 1972. Both men were thought to have reached the end of their long political careers in their early 70s, only to reinvent themselves, capture the top job, and embark on dramatic policy innovations. Both men were doubted and ridiculed by the press and their political opponents for being too old and missing a step, though not by pols who worked with them behind closed doors. Both attended Mass regularly while holding the top office. Both men repeatedly overcame devastating emotional setbacks and stayed in the political arena. And like Biden, Adenauer was scarred for life by a terrible automobile accident in his young adult years. Adenauer never learned to drive and preferred his official chauffeurs to drive fast. In mid-March 1917, Adenauer was deputy mayor of Cologne when his driver fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into a streetcar. The impact catapulted Adenauer through the glass partition and shattered his face. Both of his cheekbones and his nose were broken, several teeth were knocked from his jaw, his eyesight was blurred, and he bled profusely from multiple lacerations. Yet he stood up and walked unaided to the hospital, where he was sewn up without anesthetic. This stoic refusal to capitulate to medical setbacks (or political defeats) characterized the rest of his life. At the beginning of October 1923, still mayor of Cologne, Adenauer was hospitalized with appendicitis, a life-threatening illness requiring a long convalescence in those pre-antibiotic days. Only three weeks after the surgery, he was back at his desk dealing with the British and French occupation and crises of public unrest, unemployment, and hyperinflation. The auto accident happened only a few months after Adenauer’s beloved wife Emma, after repeated difficult childbirths, died of kidney problems at only 36. When the lord mayor of Cologne resigned in August 1917, deputy mayor Adenauer was in a sanatorium, still convalescing from his injuries (and no doubt still bereaved). A delegation from Adenauer’s Centre Party visited him to check his eligibility for lord mayor, suspecting that he had sustained a concussion and brain damage. They gave him a challenging two-hour cognitive assessment test, and Adenauer answered everything perfectly. He was elected lord mayor in September and served until Hitler took power in 1933. He was also head of the upper house of the Prussian State parliament from 1921. On February 17, 1933, Adenauer ordered swastika flags be removed from a bridge in Cologne. Soon afterward, the Nazis not only threw him out of the mayoralty but also out of his house, denying him even his salary, pension, and bank account—in part because of his friendly relations with the Jewish business community in Cologne. Having made bad investments and gone bankrupt in the stock market crash not long before, Adenauer was suddenly destitute. Unemployed, and a target for the Reich, he had to keep a low profile, and lived an itinerant life in monasteries and safe houses for several years, supported by a Jewish businessman friend of his, Daniel Heinemann, until his assets were restored to him in 1937. Adenauer had belonged to Pro Palastina, a support group for Jews who wanted to emigrate to Palestine that would ensure “a safe residence” once they got there. Though he never repaid Heinemann’s cash loan, they stayed friends till late in life, and in the early 1950s, Adenauer became the driving force behind West Germany’s reparations payments to Israel, over the objections of some of his cabinet ministers. But after Claus von Stauffenberg plot to assassinate Hitler failed in July 1944, Adenauer was pursued by the Gestapo, though he was uninvolved in the plot. He was briefly imprisoned at a detention camp near Cologne, but managed to escape and elude recapture. The Gestapo arrested his second wife, Gussi, and interrogated her. Under extreme psychological duress, she broke down and revealed where her husband was. The Gestapo found him and reincarcerated him in the same prison where she was held, but kept them separate. Distraught over having revealed her husband’s whereabouts, Gussi tried to commit suicide twice. The Gestapo then released her. Later, Adenauer’s son Max, who had been conscripted into the Wehrmacht, was able to pull strings to get his father out just before he was about to be deported to a death camp. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the Austrian SS leader who was later hanged at Nuremberg, signed off on Adenauer’s release. Gussi Adenauer died at 52 in 1948, partly from medical aftereffects of her suicide attempts. Adenauer never stopped blaming the Nazis for effectively murdering his second wife. A two-time widower, he never remarried and had no intimate companionship for the rest of his long life, apart from the company of his adult daughters on holidays. Adenauer’s own health was affected by his ordeals under the Third Reich. Skeletal after his release from two months in prison, he appeared frail during the immediate postwar aftermath, when food was scarce in Germany and malnutrition widespread. Previously Adenauer had always been disciplined about his health and self-care. Since receiving a false diagnosis of diabetes when he was 29, he had been abstemious in his diet, drinking wine sparingly. After a childhood bout of TB, which had disqualified him from serving in the Prussian Army as a youth, he never smoked or even allowed office personnel in his presence to smoke. In office as chancellor, he made time to take brisk walks. Repeated bouts of pneumonia plagued him throughout his adult life. By the time he was 80, his doctors advised him not to vacation in the mountains anymore because they thought the thinner air would strain his lungs, though he jetted around the globe extensively on diplomatic trips to the end of his chancellorship. He had headaches for years after the car accident, and chronic insomnia (worsened after 1933) led him to take nightly sleeping pills. As Cologne mayor, he had taken a short nap at lunch every working day; as chancellor he extended his daily lunchtime nap to an hour, a practice he shared with Churchill and Lyndon Johnson. Der Alte knew how to pace himself. As the war wound down in the spring of 1945, the American military governor of Cologne restored Adenauer to the mayoralty; the city had been badly damaged by Allied bombing. It was a brief restoration, though: a few months later, the British, who were by now occupying Cologne, summarily fired Adenauer for “incompetence.” It was a public humiliation. He appeared to be finished politically and physically at 70. Somehow, remarkably, Adenauer got a second wind. He organized a new political party, the Christian Democratic Union, to unite the Catholic and Protestant political blocs. “I was born on 5 January 1876, so I am probably the oldest person here,” Adenauer told the room at the first CDU meeting. “If nobody objects, I will regard myself as president by seniority.” By 1949, he had worked his way up to the top job. Who better than someone who had held government office since 1909, through three eras: the pre–WWI Kaiser era, the Allied postwar occupations of the 1920s, and the Allied postwar occupations of the 1940s—and who had survived close calls under the Nazis without collaborating? His almost Olympian calm and dignity were antidotes to the hysteria of Hitler. In 1948, a journalist reported that Adenauer “looked like a wrinkled mummy with a disconcerting capacity for breaking into speech.” His first term in office was quickly interrupted by illness. In July 1950 he came down with pneumonia and took a month off from work. He was reelected by a large margin in 1953 but in October 1955, a month after his diplomatic trip to the Soviet Union, he was bedridden with pneumonia for six weeks. As one of his biographers, Charles Williams, writes, “the mutterings started almost immediately. The Federal Republic, it was widely said, was run by a very sick and very old man; obviously he could not go on. There were long discussions in the press and on the radio about the date of his retirement—or death—and the identity of his successor.” Even Winston Churchill had retired as prime minister at 80. But Adenauer bounced back. In 1957, unknown to the German public and press, he was taking the controversial “fresh cell therapy” anti-aging treatments developed by the surgeon Paul Niehans at the Clinique La Prairie in Montreux, Switzerland, where Pope Pius XII and other world dignitaries had also been treated. Apparently, it helped. He was again reelected. As he got older, Adenauer husbanded his energies by more frequently conducting State business from his second home in a town on Italy’s Lake Como. Yet he still embarked on an arduous world tour in March 1960, enduring a 16-hour flight to New York while riding in the cockpit, and from there traveling to Washington, San Francisco, Hawaii, and Japan. On the return flight to Bonn, he stopped over in Alaska and Iceland. Though he had a bad case of bronchitis in December 1960, he pushed through at work until a public celebration of his 85th birthday seemed to return him to health. Soon enough, he flew to Washington to meet with the newly elected President Kennedy and in April 1961 visited Vice President Johnson’s ranch, where he donned a 10-gallon hat for the cameras. As Adenauer had walked off the airplane and onto the tarmac with Johnson, a TV newsman commented, “He’s 85 years old, and yet he has all the vigor of a man of 50.” Elected a fourth time on November 7, 1961 on the promise that he would resign before the end of his term, Adenauer flew to Washington D.C. for meetings on November 19 despite a fever and a full-blown case of the flu. On December 9, he flew to Paris to meet with Charles de Gaulle. On January 21, 1962, at age 86, Adenauer had a minor heart attack. The public was told he was suffering from a recurrence of influenza. He stayed home in bed for two weeks, but on February 15 he traveled by train to Baden-Baden for another meeting with de Gaulle. One year later in Paris, Adenauer, now 87, and de Gaulle, 72, signed the Élysée Treaty, the Franco-German entente that put an end to centuries of enmity between the two nations. What if Adenauer had been replaced in November 1961 by a younger leader? No younger West German leader had the necessary stature and personal rapport with General de Gaulle to be able to deliver the historic treaty. De Gaulle spoke German, Adenauer some fractured French. They had been meeting one-on-one for years. They had become friends. They were twin icons of their nations’ histories nearing the ends of their lives, and they knew they had to get it right. Throughout his 14 years as chancellor, Adenauer’s political opponents in the Bundestag would try to make fun of his age. In 1958, he tripped and almost fell on the steps to de Gaulle’s house, but 24-hour cable news had not yet been born to record such events. Despite his periodic illnesses, however, Adenauer consistently impressed dignitaries with his youthfulness. In 1953, the former British MP Harold Nicolson, who had met Adenauer in Cologne in 1928, reencountered him and thought he looked “a good twenty years younger.” Prior to Adenauer’s arrival in London for meetings with Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in November 1959, the British political class had gossiped that the West German leader was semi-senile. But after the meetings, Macmillan reported that he was struck by the man’s vitality and that rumors of his senility were nonsense. One of Adenauer’s cabinet ministers, Heinrich Krone, wrote in his diary upon Adenauer’s 87th birthday in 1963: “The Old Man is 87. Fresh, elegant, full of humor, without any sign of weakness. It is not surprising that he does not want to go.” On June 23, 1963, Adenauer rode standing up in an open limousine beside President Kennedy (a man 41 years his junior) through the streets of Cologne. During the Cuban Missile Crisis the previous October, Adenauer had advised Kennedy that he supported the blockade of Cuba, in the belief that the Soviet missiles had been deployed on the island nation to obtain concessions over the then divided city of Berlin. In early 1967, a 91-year-old Adenauer advised private citizen Richard Nixon that Washington should make overtures to Communist China in the hope of “counterbalancing” the Soviet danger. Nixon had met Adenauer many times as vice president and wrote in his book Leaders that he was so impressed by him that he felt that had Adenauer been made chancellor in the late 1920s, there would have been a better chance of Hitler not coming to power. What else did Adenauer accomplish besides weathering multiple bouts of pneumonia, periodic withdrawals, a heart attack, and criticisms of his great age? He reinstituted a free-market economy and opened access to global markets for German industry so rapidly that by 1955, West Germany had become the most powerful economy in Europe. He created social welfare programs, built housing in bombed-out areas, advocated for peaceful nuclear power. He replaced the historically aggressive Prussian face of his nation with a cooperative, integrationist posture, reaching out to such other statesmen as France’s Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman and Belgium’s Paul Henri-Spaak, creating with them the building blocks of a political and economically united Europe: the European Coal and Steel Community; the Common Market; membership in NATO. He ended denazification in the right way, letting ex-Nazis in his government know that if they didn’t toe his liberalizing political line, he would reopen denazification proceedings against them, and he established stringent democratic loyalty tests for ex-Nazis and soldiers in the Bundeswehr (the new armed forces). Though he was autocratic in style, he constructively used that role to gradually transition German citizens away from the custom of an authoritarian leadership to a democratic mode of governance. Above all, he pursued an unwavering alliance with the United States through three U.S. presidencies as a bulwark against possible Soviet aggression not only toward West Germany but to Europe as a whole. He did not succeed in reunifying East and West (that had to wait 25 years), but he set the internationalist template for all the German chancellors who succeeded him. He did all of this as an old man—and largely after his first four-year term. He needed succeeding terms in office to consolidate his achievements, much of which occurred when he was past 80. In Leaders, Nixon recounted an anecdote from his 1970 meeting with Marshal Tito in Belgrade. Tito’s wife told Nixon about a meeting years earlier between her husband and Churchill. Churchill had supposedly looked at her husband and marveled at his youthful appearance. Then Churchill answered his own question: “I know what it is. It’s power. It’s power that keeps a man young.” “When I saw Zhou Enlai in 1972 he was 73; de Gaulle in 1969 was 78; Adenauer in 1959 was 83,” wrote Nixon. “They were still in power because they were stronger and abler than the younger men in their governments. If an older political leader does not suffer from any serious ailments, he will usually make up in wisdom and judgment for what he may lack in stamina, vigor, and mental quickness.” No one can predict the vagaries of old age. Konrad Adenauer himself suffered unpredicted health events after age 82 while still in harness as head of state. Yet no historian I am aware of has ever suggested that Adenauer, infirmities and all, did not remain in full command of his office and his powers till age 87, or that the accomplishments of his later terms were any less consequential because of his age. American voters, pols, and pundits would do well to consider these facts when assessing the fitness of an 82-year-old President Biden as he runs for reelection this year.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Decades ago, Susan Riel’s husband had a chance to relocate to the West Coast. But Riel wanted to stay within driving distance of her close-knit family of seven siblings in Brooklyn. The resulting compromise has kept the couple in the Washington, D.C., region for 50 years. Twenty-one of those years have been spent at EagleBank, more than five of those now as chief executive officer and president — with Riel as the first woman to hold the roles. When she was appointed to the positions, in fact, it was a message from one of her six granddaughters that truly validated the benefits of having decided to plant roots in the mid-Atlantic. “When I became the president and CEO, one of my granddaughters said, ‘Wow, Grandma, that means I could be a president.’ That meant a lot. And if I could do that for my grandchildren, I can help other women too,” said Riel, who has worked in the banking world for the past 47 years. “I have supported women, and I’ve helped them and mentored them, and many of them I’ve seen grow, and that’s the give-back that to me at my age and my tenure in this business is more important than almost anything.” Before arriving at EagleBank as it was forming into a regional bank in the late 1990s, Riel was executive vice president of Columbia First Bank prior to First Union Bancorp (now Wells Fargo) acquiring it in 1995. In addition to steering EagleBank’s growth as a commercial real estate lender since assuming the role of chief operating officer and executive vice president in 1998, Riel has mentored many women also seeking to advance into banking leadership roles in a historically male-dominated profession. Riel spoke with Commercial Observer in late February about climbing the corporate ladder of CRE banking as a woman, changes she is implementing at EagleBank’s business model in the midst of challenging lending conditions, her outlook on the future of the D.C. area, and how the regional banking system is positioned in a higher interest rate environment. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: Where did you grow up, and what was your path into the commercial real estate side of banking? Susan Riel: I grew up in Brooklyn. I come from an Irish-Italian Catholic family: seven children, six girls and one boy, and my brother is the youngest and absolutely the apple of my eye still. I was married at age 24 — which in today’s standard is a little early — but I’m still married to the same gentleman. My husband grew up in rural New Jersey and he didn’t want to live in the city, so I knew before we got married that we would be moving outside of the city. He wanted to move to San Francisco because he had done some training there and absolutely loved it, but it was just entirely too far for me because I needed to be able to get home to visit my family when I needed it, or if they needed it, so it had to be within driving distance for me. So we looked in an area that we could drive back home on a weekend. The first year that I lived in the D.C. area, I went home at least once a month. I had worked part time for a bank when I was in New York and I wanted to get back into banking. I had also worked for what was then Dean Witter and now is Morgan Stanley, but I wanted to get back into banking. Prior to arriving at EagleBank in 1998 you spent 18 years with Signet Bank and Columbia First Bank before they were acquired by Wells Fargo. What drove the move to EagleBank? The bank I was with was sold, and my daughter at that time was a senior in high school and I wanted to spend time with her. The founders of EagleBank were talking to the chief legal officer that I had worked with about bringing someone in who could run a mortgage division. The chief legal officer recommended they call me, and I met with them but I in no way wanted to run a mortgage division. I told them I would help them find people because I did have experience in that. One conversation led to another conversation, and I did join Eagle, and I headed up the operational areas. Ultimately, we brought in a mortgage group and I had that responsibility, but that was after awhile. I have been with Eagle from before the bank launched, and it will be 26 years in March. How has it been to see a bank grow from its founding? When I came in I thought this would be easier than what I had experienced because it was a start-up. I was absolutely wrong. There were a lot of things that you had to do to get set up with all the procedures and policies and contractors. There were so many things in all the hiring of the staff, and I wore many hats because we started with 20 people and opened three branches right away. We had a very small lending group with four lenders, so it was challenging but very rewarding. I remember the first note that we closed. It was very exciting and very challenging, and I loved it. I had the chance to work with very good people. Eagle has had a lot of challenges over the years, and we’ve gotten through those challenges together. Describe what it was like rising through the ranks as a woman in your career. How are conditions now in CRE banking compared to when you first entered the industry? Now in CRE banking you see a lot of women, and, when you go to the [D.C. Bankers Association] meetings, there are a lot of women there. That was not the way it was in the beginning — there weren’t a lot of women in banking. My Eagle experience has been wonderful because I had a very supportive CEO who encouraged the development of women and allowed me to help develop and encourage other women. I have been fortunate in my career in that I’ve only actually looked for one position, and that was when I first moved to the D.C region. After that I was referred or moved with the chairman and the owners, so I’ve been given a blessing to be honest. I had one gentleman I worked for for 18 years, and every time there was a problem in the bank he would say, “Go look at this problem and see what you could do to fix it,” so I had the opportunity to explore all areas of the bank whether it was in operations or in lending or even the investor side. I had progressive managers that allowed that to happen and didn’t think of me as male or female. They saw the talent that I had and gave me that opportunity. There were also a couple people I worked for who were very difficult managers, but I had a good relationship with them. I think they saw the benefits of women in leadership positions and recognized that I had those skills, and so they were able to help me and give me the opportunities. I’ve been blessed, and paying that back is important. So I would say that I believe that the best people to be put in positions should be the people put in positions. But often women are the best people and they’re often not looked at in that light, so I think I can bring more of that focus to them. I think the industry — and, in general, people — are seeing that women leaders are often more effective. You’re planning this year to “revolutionize” EagleBank’s CRE strategy. What changes are you planning and what was the impetus? EagleBank has been known as a CRE bank as that’s how we started. We’ve been successful and a high performer because of that focus. We don’t ever want to lose that because we have expertise in that area and we are recognized in this industry and market for that expertise. But what we want now is to enhance that. We are skilled in the commercial and industrial [C&I] loan market also, so we want to grow that business, which will allow us to diversify on some of the deposits that we have and will also allow us to increase the fee income because that’s what a C&I business does. We’re also looking at enhancing the consumer as we have a consumer part of our book, but not a strong part. The consumers that we have primarily have been people walking into our branches or business owners that bring their personal accounts and their employees’ accounts to us. We will be looking at enhancing that and moving into a digital presence. We don’t want to lose CRE. There are certainly challenges, but we have a strong team of very seasoned people that know the CRE market. We have one gentleman who has been in the CRE market for over 50 years. When things started to become a problem and when it was obvious to us that there were issues, we immediately pulled that team together. That team is strong, and we will get through this. There will be challenges, but we’ll get through them. I’m proud of the team that we have and proud of how we formed through some very challenging times. Speaking of challenging times, how was EagleBank’s lending portfolio positioned before the Federal Reserve began its aggressive interest rate hikes in early 2022? I think we were positioned well, but we were already thinking of expanding and enhancing that model then because, again, the CRE model has helped us and made us high-performing, and we did well for 25 years. But everything is changing, and we had to diversify and we needed to have stickier deposits. We had already recognized that we needed to begin to change our business model — not lose sight of what made us Eagle and made us the bank we are today, but enhance that with the other areas. Growing in the digital space is something that is new for us and it’s new for a lot of banks, but some banks have been in it for a while. So we just launched our digital expansion. We went in quietly so we’re not really active in it right now, but we have been working on it over the last 12 or 18 months so we’re looking at bringing in some good deposits. We knew we needed to change — or what I prefer to call “enhance our model.” What types of loans are you originating now? In the market right now, with the high interest rates, you don’t have many people wanting to pay those rates. There are some that do, and in instances where we have a customer relationship and they are asking us to do something we do whatever we can. We started the bank with a “relationship first” culture, and we will never lose that. You have been a very active lender in the Washington, D.C., market. How do you see the region shaping up in a post-COVID world given there are many office vacancies in the nation’s capital and many businesses looking toward the suburbs? The entire D.C.-Maryland-Northern Virginia region is a strong market. The inner city in particular is struggling, and a lot of that is due to the fact that the government has a third of the office leases and the federal government is not bringing people back to work. The D.C government has announced that they’ll be bringing people back four days a week. The federal government, although they have tried to do that, are fighting unions. The suburbs are flourishing and you could not get a better market than Northern Virginia, and we are recognized in that area. We did an acquisition of Virginia Heritage Bank back in 2014 to get our name in the Virginia market and we also have the naming rights for George Mason University with EagleBank Arena, so that gets us a lot of publicity, too. Virginia was a hard market to break into and it took us a long time, but we are a strong competitor in the Virginia market, and in Maryland and D.C as well. But there’s lots of growth opportunities, and the political environment in Virginia is more pro business than the political environment in Maryland. How do you view the overall health of the regional banking system after last year’s collapse of three banks and the struggles of New York Community Bank in early 2024? I think that there were a lot of things that happened with Silicon Valley Bank that none of us really know, and they made some big mistakes that caused a ripple throughout the industry. The government is the government, and were they part of that? We lost significant deposits during that time, but I will say our team once again pulled together and we’ve worked through that. I am very proud to say that the deposits we lost were more than recovered at the end of 2023, so we were back in a good position. But we struggled with the regional banking crisis like many did at that time. The industry still has not totally recovered from it. Have you seen a lot of regional bank competitors retreat since interest rates began going up? I think we’re all seeing that. The big banks have stopped lending and it’s the regional banks that are still lending, but cautiously lending. If the borrowers don’t need the money, they’re not looking for it because the interest rates are so high. Now they’re talking about bringing those interest rates down, but I also heard about the possibility of an increase in them, so who knows? No one has a crystal ball, and we will have to just manage through whatever is happening. To close on a lighter note, what do you enjoy doing outside of work? Family. I’m fortunate that I have five children, with three of them within 30 minutes of where I live. One is in Charlotte, which is an hour and half flight, and the other lives 30 minutes from a beach house that I have in Delaware. So I spend whatever time I can with my children, but I’m also involved in outside activities. Eagle is very connected in this community. Our lending team, and even outside of the lending team, does a lot of things out in the community. Eagle has always been recognized for all of that.

       "  'content': 'JOCOTENANGO, Guatemala — On a quiet cobblestone street in a town 90 minutes outside of Guatemala City, class was in session for hundreds of young Guatemalans on a Monday morning. Children in kindergarten through ninth grade moved through the open-air courtyard of the free private school for disadvantaged students, which is run by a global nonprofit group based in Denver. Painted on the wall by its entrance were the Spanish words, “La escuela, la esperanza” — or “The school, the hope.” More than 1,900 miles north of the School of Hope, Denver city officials and residents have grappled for more than a year with accommodating a surge of immigrants — largely from Venezuela — that has stretched city resources. But going back six decades, Guatemala has served as a recurring source of newcomers to the state, with 2022 census data showing Colorado was home to about 7,900 people who had immigrated from the Central American country. While the influx from Venezuela has drawn the most recent attention, Guatemala has long ranked among the top Latin American sources of migrants to the United States; it only fell behind Mexico and Venezuela during the most recent federal fiscal year. Between 2000 and 2021, the number of foreign-born Guatemalans in the U.S. more than tripled to about 1 million, according to the Pew Research Center. To curb migration, two Denver-area nonprofits are taking a hands-on approach in Guatemala. They’re working on the ground to reduce poverty and address other conditions that have spurred many of its citizens to journey to the U.S. Education for the Children Foundation provides at-risk students with free education, meals and mental health services in Jocotenango, aiming to set them up for future success in their own country. Meanwhile, Lakewood-based Friendship Bridge makes business loans to Indigenous women who are entrepreneurs in rural areas, helping them to build lives for themselves and their families. The migrant crisis “is not an issue that can be handled by any one nation, any one state, any one city or any one nonprofit,” said Juan Carlos Franco Orellana, a general case manager at the Denver nonprofit Servicios de La Raza. But, he added, “organizations like those that are putting in that work to improve conditions in Guatemala — I would say, they’re the ones really making headway.” During a visit by a Denver Post reporter to the School of Hope in late February, eighth grader Juan Carlos spoke about his hopes in a country where a student’s future is broadly determined by education. His last name was withheld, at the school’s request, for privacy. He is one of seven siblings, and a brother has already traveled far from home to chase the American dream. But Juan Carlos, 14, aims to graduate and stay in Guatemala to support his family. He first earned pocket change by polishing shoes on the street. Now, after school lets out for the day, he heads to the local market, where his sister sells chicken. He hawks clothing, making a monthly average of 500 to 600 quetzales, the equivalent of $64 to $77. But the budding entrepreneur has plans that transcend market stalls: to get his high school diploma, then pursue a career as either an agronomist or a chef. “I hope that we have a better future here in Guatemala,” Juan Carlos said in Spanish through a translator, while sitting in a classroom. William Gómez, 42, a career counselor at the school, sees himself in the pupils he mentors. His childhood dream was to become a doctor, he said, but his family couldn’t afford that ambition. His father, a widower, worked for decades at a warehouse to support Gómez and three siblings as they grew up in the nearby city of Antigua. At age 10, Gómez helped craft ceramic figurines to sell at the market. Throughout his life, he’s considered migrating to the U.S. in search of job opportunities. But today, Gómez remains in his home country. He’s buoyed, he said in Spanish, by the hope that his students will “be that change that the country and the world needs.” Civil war, corruption and inequality Present-day Guatemala was forged by a tumultuous history, including decades of civil war and corrupt politics, along with extreme economic inequalities. Significant numbers of residents have left the country to escape those conflicts and pressures — including immigrants who established longstanding Guatemalan communities in Alamosa and Denver. “This is a country that was really built on a base of inequality,” said Regina Bateson, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Colorado Boulder. “The problem is not a sheer lack of wealth. The problem is the distribution of that wealth.” In a nation where about half of the population identifies as Indigenous — the Maya are the largest Native community — those citizens are overwhelmingly impacted by racial prejudice and poverty. The injustices date back centuries, with many Indigenous Guatemalans forced into agricultural labor through debt servitude in the 19th century. The mounting systemic problems exploded into the Guatemalan Civil War in 1960. As the federal military and leftist guerrillas fought for 36 years, more than 200,000 Guatemalans died — most of them Indigenous. The violence drove survivors from their homes. While the war ended in 1996 with a peace accord, “a lot of the issues that caused the civil war remained unresolved,” Bateson said. Today, hundreds of Indigenous families from the municipality of Santa Eulalia in western Guatemala reside in Colorado’s San Luis Valley. Generations have called it home since migrants began resettling there in the 1980s. Father Carlos Alvarez of Alamosa’s Sacred Heart Church said the mountainous region reminded the newcomers of Guatemala, with the church and the mushroom farm — long the immigrants’ largest local employer — serving as community focal points. Many of the Guatemalans who first moved to the valley were originally seeking asylum in the U.S. A group of churches established the San Luis Valley Immigrant Resource Center to remedy the absence of immigration attorneys in the area, said executive director Flora Archuleta. Its team has since helped immigrants prepare their work authorization paperwork and renew their green cards. The parents of Marisol Cristobal-Lucas, 27, came to Alamosa in one of the waves of migration. During Guatemala’s civil war, her father, Lucas Francisco Lucas, was one of the young Mayan men picked up at random by militants and trained for months in guerrilla warfare. In 1986, he crossed the southwestern U.S. desert as an undocumented immigrant to work on the mushroom farm in Colorado with his brother. “It was a good opportunity for them to make good money,” Cristobal-Lucas said. Her mother, Eulalia Cristobal Sebastian, joined her father around 1993. Both had initially expected their stay in the U.S. to be temporary as they saved money. But Cristobal-Lucas said her father eventually became a U.S. citizen through programs set in motion by a Reagan-era amnesty law, and her mother secured a green card. Decades later, Servicios de La Raza’s Orellana said, back in Guatemala, “economically, things are still very hard.” Even blue-collar industries, such as construction, don’t offer the same opportunities as in the U.S. because Guatemala isn’t building infrastructure as quickly, said Orellana, who was born in Guatemala City. Although the country is home to Central America’s largest economy, with its gross domestic product valued at $95 billion in 2022, according to the World Bank, over half of the population lives in poverty. Guatemalans are pushing to reduce government corruption, but Bateson, the CU professor, called domestic politics “pretty complicated,” with elected leaders prone to self-enrichment and involvement with organized crime. “It’s one of the most unstable party systems in the world,” she said. Still, despite Guatemala’s challenges, Vivi Lemus is among immigrants here who work to counter negative perceptions about their homeland. She is a co-owner of Convivio Café, a bilingual coffee shop in northwest Denver, and has now lived in Colorado with her husband for more than 20 years. “You hear corruption, you hear occupation and you hear all the strife,” said Lemus, 48. “You seldom hear about the hospitality, the kindness, the beauty of people, the flavors, the amazing Mayan culture that extends centuries — and the wisdom that is my heritage.” School’s goal is for students “to stay here in Guatemala” With its focus on improving conditions for Guatemalans, Denver-based Education for the Children Foundation began as a scholarship program two decades ago. In 2005, it expanded to open the School of Hope in Jocotenango, with 80 pupils at its start. The student body has since quintupled to 400, with a staff of about 60 employees. Every year, the school accepts 40 or so new students, usually of kindergarten age. “We never advertise, because we have too much demand,” said Sara Miller, the nonprofit’s U.S. executive director. Instead, the pupils’ parents often first learn about the school through word of mouth. About 25% of those parents are illiterate, with the majority having only reached sixth grade in their education, Miller said. Because entry-level jobs often require at least a high school education, unlearned Guatemalans tend to earn a living in the country’s informal economy. The majority of the nation’s working population — 68% of men and 76% of women — tried to make money informally in 2021, says a report by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Miller said her students’ fathers often work as bus drivers and construction workers, while their mothers are paid to make tortillas, clean houses and iron clothes. She estimates that the families earn the equivalent of $200 to $300 per month. Today, evidence of Guatemala’s wealth inequalities is readily apparent. While luxury apartment buildings tower over Guatemala City, to the west in Jocotenango, a shantytown of illegally built homes rises up the hillside of La Vista Hermosa — a makeshift community where about 150 School of Hope families live as squatters, Miller said. The municipal land isn’t zoned for housing because it’s prone to landslides, but residents accept the risk to avoid paying rent. The cobblestone path winding through the neighborhood was traversed by family members picking up their children from the nearby public school. Then, they hopped on motorcycles or into three-wheeled vehicles called tuk-tuks — both cheap modes of transportation in Guatemala. Across from a soccer field, a mural painted on a wall urged “la no violencia,” or nonviolence. The public education system is free, but is “really underfunded,” Miller said, with 60 students crammed into a classroom for just three or four hours of instruction per day. So, some parents opt to enroll their children in private school, though costs quickly add up for school supplies, uniforms and more. The School of Hope helps ease those financial burdens by offering high-quality education at no cost to its students. Aracely Chajón, director of the school’s social services programs, said the students’ families still deal with socioeconomic problems, sometimes resulting in violence, alcoholism and absentee parenting in households. Chajón, 39, said in Spanish that “a very beautiful part of the foundation is to volunteer a place where (students) feel they have the confidence” and the trust to express themselves openly at school. There, “someone listens to them.” During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chajón and Miller watched as several of the school’s pupils left Guatemala, with 10 immigrating as unaccompanied minors to the U.S. to join relatives. But other students decided to remain in the country because they wanted to graduate. The majority returned to school when viral outbreaks eased, Miller said. “Our goal is for them to stay here in Guatemala,” she said. She hopes to open both a preschool and a high school. The foundation plans to construct another building, which will cost $1 million; it’s raised $500,000 for the project so far. “Through education and access to opportunities, (students) can find a good job in Guatemala and be able to support themselves,” Miller said. “Their children will grow up in a very different environment.” Entrepreneurship offers women new opportunities Since Friendship Bridge launched its Guatemala operation in 1998, the Lakewood nonprofit has focused on offering a lifeline through business. It largely supports Indigenous women entrepreneurs by providing business training, individual loans, group lending and education on topics, such as women’s rights. Because of the dearth of medical care in rural Guatemala, the nonprofit also offers health services. More than two decades after its start, Friendship Bridge now serves about 35,000 clients — women who typically come from impoverished communities and share the task of taking care of large families, said Indira Maldonado, the organization’s communications and visual design coordinator. But they often find themselves stuck in “a cycle of the poverty,” she added. Maldonado, 25, places much of the blame on her country’s machismo-inflected culture, which fosters violence, alcoholism and other problems. “In this culture of machismo, it’s really hard for women to have their own voice,” she said. So, the nonprofit seeks to empower women because, “when you give to women, they invest everything for their families,” Maldonado said. Lidia Par Puzul, 37, usually creates her goods at home, shaded under a roof of blue tarp and tin, in the small town of Cipresales in the country’s western highlands. But during The Post’s visit in late February, she demonstrated the art of beading at Friendship Bridge’s Guatemala headquarters in Panajachel. Her wares — Christmas ornaments, chunky necklaces and animal figurines of various colors and sizes — were spread out on the table in front of her as she threaded minuscule beads onto a needle and pulled, working toward the final product: a red bracelet. Like other Mayan women, she wore the traditional outfit of a corte (skirt), huipil (blouse) and faja (belt). She said she knew how to embroider beads on shirts, too. Par Puzul learned how to make handicrafts at 8 years old — a skill taught by her father, who sold them around the country. Saddled with the responsibility of helping her family as the eldest daughter, she dropped out of school after finishing fourth grade. Her mother, also a craftswoman, secured her first loan of 500 quetzales, or about $64 in today’s money, through Friendship Bridge. Par Puzul joined as a young adult and has received several loans herself. She used the money to grow her handicraft shop in Panajachel, which she ran with her husband, José Ibate. She became an artisan in the Handmade by Friendship Bridge program, with the nonprofit selling her products in its online store. In 2017, thieves robbed the couple of materials, products and other items worth about 300,000 quetzales, or $38,414. José Ibate debated immigrating to the U.S. to earn money for the family. But because of Par Puzul’s work with Friendship Bridge, her spouse stayed in Guatemala to rebuild their business together. A mother herself, Par Puzul said in Spanish that, even though school costs a lot of money, “what I want is for my daughters to study, and that is the most important thing.” Saida Perez, 51, is also a businesswoman from Guatemala. But “my story is not very reflective to a lot of my conationals,” she said. Growing up in Guatemala City, “I was a privileged kid that was able to go to a private school,” Perez added. In 1989, she moved to the U.S. with the proper paperwork and is now an American citizen. Perez, who lives in Thornton, runs her own insurance agency and caters to the local Latino community, especially youth and women. As the founder of Alianza Migrante Guatemalteca, or the Guatemalan Immigrant Alliance, she’s one of the advocates behind the establishment of Denver’s Guatemalan consulate in 2004 and the 2013 passage by the state legislature of the Colorado Road and Community Safety Act. That law allows all qualifying Colorado residents — including undocumented immigrants and refugees — to obtain standard driver’s licenses or ID cards. “It’s a challenge to live outside your country, and to keep traditions and to keep the culture and to be represented,” Perez said. “I am always going for more — trying for Guatemalans to have a voice.” Nearly 2,000 miles away, the local teams of Friendship Bridge and Education for the Children Foundation also try to keep attuned to the voices of Guatemalans as they work to improve their lives, year after year. To Maldonado, nonprofits like Friendship Bridge “support this vision for women to have better futures, and the next generations to have better futures.” As a country, she said, “we’re growing — maybe with tiny steps, but we’re growing.”',\n",
